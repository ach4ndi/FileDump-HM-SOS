\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f49\u2135\u232f\u206eIsaac\u206c\u232c\u2328\u2261You look different since\u2328your marriage.\u232bLike you've grown up\u2328a little.
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIsaac\u206c\u232c\u2328It's very windy today.\u232b\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f49\u2135\u222cBut these are the days \u2328when windmills shine.\u232b\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135This strong wind should\u2328make the windmills work\u2328a lot faster.
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIsaac\u206c\u232c\u2328This is quite the storm.\u2328\u222cIt's perfect for windmills.\u232b\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f49\u2135This strong wind should\u2328make the windmills work\u2328a lot faster.
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f49\u2135\u232f\u206eIsaac\u206c\u232c\u2328\u222cWe've known each other\u2328for some time now.\u232bI hope we can stay\u2328good friends.
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIsaac\u206c\u232c\u2328This town has always\u2328had windmills.\u232b\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f49\u2135\u2261I've improved them a bit\u2328in my time, though.
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIsaac\u206c\u232c\u2328\u222cWilbur built this\u2328house for Nellie and me.\u232b\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f49\u2135He really made a sturdy\u2328and wonderful home. 
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIsaac\u206c\u232c\u2328The meals that Nellie makes\u2328are very good, but... \u232bshe always makes so much!\u2328And look at me now!\u2328\u270a\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f49\u2135\u222cHo ho ho ho.
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIsaac\u206c\u232c\u2328Not many people were using\u2328the windmills.\u232b\u222cI'm glad you came to this\u2328town, \u232a!
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIsaac\u206c\u232c\u2328Wilbur and I have been\u2328friends since childhood.\u232b\u222cOur families get along\u2328really well too.
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIsaac\u206c\u232c\u2328\u2264Being a farmer seems\u2328like it's hard work.\u232bHow do you find enough\u2328time in the day to get\u2328everything done?

\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIsaac\u206c\u232c\u2328How are things going?\u2328\u232b\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f49\u2135\u222cLet me know if you ever\u2328need a hand with anything.

\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIsaac\u206c\u232c\u2328This windmill is the newest\u2328one in town.\u232b\u222fIt's still older than me,\u2328though!
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIsaac\u206c\u232c\u2328\u222cEvery single gear in a\u2328windmill is important.\u232bIf one breaks, the whole\u2328thing grinds to a halt.
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2135\u232f\u206eIsaac\u206c\u232c\u2328Windmills require a lot\u2328of maintenance.\u232b\u2264I care for each one like\u2328it's one of my children!
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIsaac\u206c\u232c\u2328Windmills are amazing\u2328machines.\u232b\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f49\u2135\u222eHarnessing the power\u2328of wind...
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIsaac\u206c\u232c\u2328\u222cThere's a bazaar today!\u232bI hope we get a lot of\u2328business.
