\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136Spring is so warm, and so\u2328full of new life.\u232bIt's a gift from the Harvest\u2328Goddess.
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136I do love spring.\u232bHow has work been going?\u2328
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136The cherry blossoms are in\u2328full bloom now.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136I'm sure the Harvest Goddess\u2328must be in a good mood...
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136I just love spring.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136How lucky we are! The cold\u2328winter is behind us, and\u2328warm days are ahead!
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136It's so hot...\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136The Harvest Goddess must\u2328stay so nice and cool in\u2328her spring.
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136It's been quite muggy out.\u232bHow is your work going?\u2328
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136It's so hot out.\u232bPlease be careful not to\u2328get dehydrated.
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136It's so hot out lately.\u232bDo you think the Harvest\u2328Goddess is in a bad mood?
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136It's the season of bounty.\u232bI think the season puts the\u2328Harvest Goddess in a good\u2328mood, don't you?
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136It's much nicer out now.\u2328\u232bHow has work been going?\u2328
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136The mornings and nights are\u2328getting colder now...\u232bPlease be careful not to\u2328catch a cold...
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136Fall is finally here.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136The autumn leaves in the\u2328village are so pretty.

\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136Winter can be so cold...\u232bI'm sure the cold is a\u2328trial given to us by the\u2328Harvest Goddess...
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136It's really winter now.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136The sight of the snowy\u2328mountain is so cleansing\u2328to the soul...
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136I think the good weather\u2328means that the Harvest\u2328Goddess' mood is also good.
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136The weather has been\u2328so changeable these days.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136I wonder if the Harvest\u2328Goddess is in a bad mood...
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136The weather is subject to\u2328the whims of the Goddess.\u232bBut no matter what the\u2328weather is like, we must\u2328never forget to be thankful.

\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136It's so rainy today.\u232bI wonder if the Harvest\u2328Goddess is in a bad mood...

\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136Sometimes I get so focused\u2328on one thing that I lose\u2328sight of everything else.\u232bThe other day I saw a boar\u2328chasing a raccoon...\u2328\u232bI tried to help the raccoon,\u2328but it disappeared so\u2328quickly...\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136I was so worried about the\u2328raccoon that I couldn't get\u2328to sleep that night...

\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136I'm still in training, so\u2328I've got a lot to learn.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136But lately I've been feeling\u2328a vain desire for some cute\u2328clothes...\u232bI know I shouldn't desire\u2328such material things...
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136Sometimes I get so focused\u2328on one thing that I lose\u2328sight of everything else.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136I ran into Rutger the other\u2328day, and there was something\u2328moving under his hat!\u232bHe said it was nothing...\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136But I couldn't stop thinking\u2328about it all morning, and I\u2328couldn't concentrate...
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136The people of this village\u2328make me see how wonderful\u2328family is...\u232bHoward and his daughter are\u2328so close.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136I saw him and Laney going\u2328for a walk together the\u2328other day.
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136\u232a, you work so hard\u2328every day.\u232bThe Harvest Goddess loves\u2328those who work hard.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136So I'm sure she's noticed\u2328all your efforts.
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136When I came by here the\u2328other day, Cam was tending\u2328to the flowers.\u232bAnd before that, Laney was\u2328watering them.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136These flower beds here are\u2328full of the villagers'\u2328kindness, aren't they?\u232bIt's so wonderful.
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136I'm still in training, so\u2328I've got a lot to learn.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136But lately I've been feeling\u2328an unbecoming craving\u2328for chocolate.\u232bI know I shouldn't desire\u2328such material things...\u2328This training is hard.
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136Sometimes I get so focused\u2328on one thing that I lose\u2328sight of everything else.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136Yesterday, when I was in\u2328the mountains, I came across\u2328a boy talking to himself.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136Maybe something sad had\u2328happened to him, because it\u2328looked like he was crying.\u232bHe left right away, but...\u2328\u232bI was so worried about him\u2328that I couldn't sleep last\u2328night.
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136The people of this village\u2328make me see how wonderful\u2328family is...\u232bGrady's and Georgia are\u2328funny.\u232bThe other day they were\u2328having a staring contest.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136They let me join in, but\u2328I couldn't beat them...\u2328
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136\u232a, do you\u2328know about the Wonderfuls?\u232bThey say if you collect all\u23286, your wish will\u2328be granted.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136The Wonderfuls must be\u2328really wonderful...\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f4d\u2136Oh...e-excuse me.\u2328That sounded a little silly.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136The villagers take such good\u2328care of these flower beds.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136It makes me happy to see\u2328how tenderly these flowers\u2328are cared for.
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136I'm still in training, so\u2328I've got a lot to learn.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136But recently, it's getting\u2328hard for me to relinquish\u2328the desire to talk to you.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f4d\u2136I know I shouldn't desire\u2328such things...\u2328This training is so hard.
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136Sometimes I get so focused\u2328on one thing that I lose\u2328sight of everything else.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136I spent all day thinking\u2328about what I'd talk to you\u2328about today.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136But now I'm having so much\u2328fun, I forget what I was\u2328thinking of saying.
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136The people of this village\u2328make me see how wonderful\u2328family is...\u232bDon't you agree?\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136Hee hee.\u2328I'm glad I came to this\u2328village.

\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136Isn't this fountain lovely?\u232bIts cool spray cleanses\u2328the soul.
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136\u232a, how is\u2328work going lately?\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136You know you always have\u2328my support.

\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136\u232a, the Harvest\u2328Goddess is always watching\u2328over us.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136So she sees everything, even\u2328sneaky pranks you try to\u2328play.
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136You work so hard every day,\u2328\u232a.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136All your hard work inspires\u2328me to work hard too!
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136I've served the Harvest\u2328Goddess with Nathan since\u2328I was little...\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136And it's always brought me\u2328so much happiness.
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136Friends are so wonderful.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136All the villagers are so\u2328friendly with each other.\u2328It always makes me smile.

\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136\u232a, do you feel like\u2328you're making the most of\u2328your life?\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136I feel like my life in the\u2328village is very fulfilling.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136Nathan says that all those\u2328who believe in the Harvest\u2328Goddess are family.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136Isn't family wonderful?
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136Laney and Georgia are such\u2328good friends.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136The other day they gave me\u2328some cookies they baked\u2328together.\u232bThey were really delicious.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136\u232a...\u2328everything in our lives has\u2328meaning.\u232bOnce Nathan and I went to\u2328an island to start another\u2328church there.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136I know it was a meaningful\u2328trip.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136\u232a, have you ever\u2328met the Harvest Goddess? \u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136I hope I get to meet her.\u2328\u232bShe must be so graceful and\u2328elegant...

\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136Nathan always asks the\u2328Harvest Goddess to give\u2328happiness to the villagers.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136And that includes you,\u2328of course, \u232a.\u2328

\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136Do you like books,\u2328\u232a?\u232bWhen I was little, I used to\u2328read the books in the church\u2328all the time.

\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136It's easy to be angry at\u2328people, but it's not so\u2328easy to forgive them.\u232b\u232a, what do you do\u2328when you're angry with\u2328someone?\u232b\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136It helps to take a deep\u2328breath and try to take a\u2328step back from yourself.
\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136\u232a,\u2328I think people who have a\u2328goal are so impressive.\u232bWhen I watch someone trying\u2328their hardest, I want to\u2328cheer them on.

\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136\u232a...\u232bYou're such...\u270b\u2328\u1f41\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136a kind person.\u232bI really respect how you're\u2328always thinking of others.
