\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136Yesterday's weather was\u2328awful. You shouldn't even\u2328go out on days like that.
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136What's up, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136What's up, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136What's up, \u232a?

\u1f46\u1fba\u1f4a\u2136Wh-What's that?\u2328I don't like it!
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136What's up, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f49\u2136That's a Blue Feather, huh?\u2328Neat!\u232b\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136Who are you gonna give\u2328it to?
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136For me?\u2328But I don't want it!
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136Another gift for me?\u2328Oh, I couldn't take\u2328another today.
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136What's up, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136What's up, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136Hey, that's not the kind of\u2328thing you should try to\u2328give away!
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f49\u2136Wow, a \u206dMixed Smoothie\u206c?\u2328For my birthday? Thanks!\u232bYippee!\u2328I love these!\u2328I'll drink it with my mom!

\u1f46\u1fba\u1f49\u2136Thanks a lot!\u2328I really like these!\u2328Yippee!
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136How'd you know it was my\u2328birthday today?\u2328Thanks a lot!
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136Thanks a lot!\u2328This is pretty neat!
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f4b\u2136Uh...this is a birthday\u2328present? Well, I guess I'll\u2328take it...
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f4b\u2136Oh, yuck! I don't like this\u2328at all. Guess I've gotta\u2328take it, though.
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f4b\u2136I hate this stuff! My mom's\u2328always telling me to eat it.\u2328I'll just give it to her.
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136What's up, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136What's up, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136\u232a, when I'm older,\u2328could you teach me how\u2328to invite girls on dates?\u232bI can't think of anybody\u2328else I could talk to about\u2328stuff like that.
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136You came all this way\u2328in this howling wind?\u2328Th-That's dangerous!
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136It's snowing so heavily,\u2328I can barely see a thing\u2328outside!
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f49\u2136I have lots and lots of\u2328respect for you, \u232a.\u232bI know I'm gonna learn a\u2328lot more from you, too.\u2328I'm glad we're friends!
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136Why don't I do much fun\u2328stuff with my mom?\u232bUh, well...\u2328When my dad was still alive\u2328we used to have more fun.\u232bThat was a long time ago,\u2328so I don't remember it much.
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136Do you like this village?\u232b\u1f46\u1fba\u1f49\u2136Oh, I can tell you do!\u2328That's great!
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136My ancestors have always\u2328been mayors of the village.\u232bI wonder if I'll grow up to\u2328be a fine mayor like my mom.\u2328I worry about it sometimes.
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136My mom's pretty strict, but\u2328she's actually really nice\u2328when you get to know her.
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136Lots of people come and go\u2328at the town hall. It's\u2328always so busy.
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136I try to help my mom out\u2328as much as I can.

\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136I'm always teaching Ying\u2328stuff about the village.
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136The outfit I'm wearing has\u2328been passed down through\u2328generations of my family.\u232bDon't you think that it's\u2328pretty nifty?\u2328I like it.
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136I heard that Dirk is from\u2328some other country.\u232bHe has all kinds of\u2328interesting stories.
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136In this village, my\u2328ancestors have served as\u2328mayors for many generations.
\u1f46\u1fba\u1f48\u2136Aw, it started raining.\u2328And just when I was going\u2328to play...\u232bI hope it lets up soon...\u2328I want to play with Ying.
