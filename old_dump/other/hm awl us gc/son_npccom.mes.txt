hair than {CharName_22}! {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_9}I don't really see
the difference... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard a rumor that
{CharName_5} really
doesn't want to go {NextPage_1}back home to his
village. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_12}I wonder if that's
true? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard that {CharName_24} used
to be a comedian.{NextPage_49}
I wonder if he'd
teach me? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard a rumor that
{CharName_3}'s eyebrows
are really these{NextPage_1}things called

{50_1_0_12}I wonder who draws
on people like that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard a rumor from
{CharName_16} that {CharName_6}

{CharName_30} used
to be really weak! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard {CharName_2} was

At least that's

told me! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard that {CharName_31}
has a bag full of
scalpels! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------

That's what
{CharName_24} told me! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I'm talking! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard a rumor
that Grandpa {CharName_7}
had a bad experience {NextPage_1}with a yellow towel
or something. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_35}I wonder what could
have happened? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard that {CharName_8}'s

"special ordered". {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard that even
{CharName_9} has

play the piano.
That's weird. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{CharName_10}...
{50_1_0_25}Um...nothing... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard that when
{CharName_13}'s Dad gets
serious, he's even{NextPage_1}more powerful.

----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard {CharName_20}
used to be picked on
a lot. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard that even
{CharName_21} thinks
of using tools. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_9}It must be tough
being an artist. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}I heard a rumor that
{CharName_22} is
a sore loser... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_25}I heard a rumor that
{CharName_23}'s clothes
are actually {NextPage_1}the ones that
{CharName_22} was wearing.{NextPage_49}
They had a contest
and that's how
he got them. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard that {CharName_5}'s
hometown is a very
warm place. {NextPage_0}

money. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard a rumor that
{CharName_4}'s parents
are rich. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I hard that {CharName_26} is
popular with the
city girls. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_12}I heard that
{CharName_27}'s
guitar is not easy{NextPage_1}to find. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{CharName_3} is always
polishing girls. {NextPage_49}
I wonder what
that means? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard that {CharName_6}
is getting bored of
{CharName_28}'s cooking... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard that {CharName_28}
has "hypotension". {NextPage_49}
I wonder what that
means? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard that {CharName_29}
was once married. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard that {CharName_30}
used to be a really
weak guy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{CharName_2} said that
when {CharName_29} and
{CharName_30} fight, it's {NextPage_1}like the end of
the world. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard that {CharName_31}
hates to move around
in the winter. {NextPage_49}
Couldn't he just
put on some
long-johns? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_13}I heard that {CharName_35}
can actually speak
as humans do. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard {CharName_36} was
{CharName_8}'s rival. {NextPage_49}
They must have been
in competition for
something... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I'm talking. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}Grandpa {CharName_7}
is really cool. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{CharName_8} seems to
be a little bit of
a troublemaker... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{CharName_9} is also
good at singing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}I heard a rumor that
{CharName_10} published
a book about how to{NextPage_1}become a good
butler.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}{CharName_13}'s Dad's
sports career was
pretty short I heard.{NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_35}The life of an
athlete is arduous. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_13}This is just between
you and me, okay? {NextPage_49}
{CharName_13}'s Mom
became an announcer
because she wanted{NextPage_1}to marry an athlete.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_13}I think {CharName_13}
questions his Dad's
training methods. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_13}{CharName_16}'s Dad
doesn't really like
to being at home...{NextPage_49}
That must be
hard... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I don't think {CharName_16}'s
Mom thinks too
highly of me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_13}I wonder if {CharName_16}
will ever be able to
get married... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{CharName_17} treats his
bonsai as if it were
his grandmother. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I think {CharName_19}
actually has a lab
in his basement... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_33}{CharName_20}'s songs
are inspired by some
woman in his life. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}{CharName_21} heard the
call of metal work
when he was my age. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_12}I wonder when {CharName_22}
will light the
fireworks. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_35}I'd like to see
them go off. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_13}I think {CharName_23}
has athlete's feet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_33}I heard that {CharName_5}'s
wife is beautiful. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}Do you know why {CharName_24}
wears a hat? {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_13}I heard he's going
bald... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard {CharName_25} is
also good at sewing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}{CharName_4} isn't
very good at talking
to females. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}{CharName_26} doesn't really
think too well of
his father... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}{CharName_27} started
playing guitar the
same age I am now. {NextPage_49}
I guess that's when
he wanted to get
girls? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{CharName_3} has a lot
of money saved up. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{CharName_6}'s necklace
has many meanings. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_13}It gives me a weird
feeling... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard {CharName_28} was
a very gentle child. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I think {CharName_29} worked
a little too hard
and men are now kind {NextPage_1}of intimidated by
her. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I think that {CharName_30}
is good looking
for a guy. {NextPage_49}
I wonder if he has
a girlfriend or not? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}I don't get the best
feeling from {CharName_2}
because she looks{NextPage_1}very pure and
nice. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I wonder if {CharName_31}
really does wear
color contacts? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard that {CharName_35}
sleeps deep in the
forest until Fall. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{CharName_36} said
he'd never cut off
his topknot. {NextPage_49}
No matter what
happened. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_2}... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}Grandpa {CharName_7}
is really cool. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{CharName_8} seems to
be a little bit of
a troublemaker... {NextPage_0}

{50_1_0_1}I heard that {CharName_5}'s
wife is beautiful. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}Do you know why {CharName_24}
wears a hat? {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_13}I heard he's going
bald... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard {CharName_25} is
also good at sewing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}{CharName_4} isn't
very good at talking
to females. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}{CharName_26} doesn't really
think too well of
his father... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}{CharName_27} started
playing guitar the

I guess that's when
he wanted to get

{50_1_0_1}I heard that {CharName_35}
sleeps deep in the

----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{CharName_36} said
he'd never cut off
his topknot. {NextPage_49}
No matter what
happened. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_2}...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Grandpa {CharName_7}'s
voice is cool. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_26}He could attract
lots of girls with
his voice. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard that {CharName_8}'s
storage room has
lots of treasures. {NextPage_49}
I'd like to sneak
in there and take a
peek sometime. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}Everyone who {CharName_9}
has liked up to now
has been older. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard that
{CharName_10}
is both a butler{NextPage_49}
and a writer.
That's got to be a
busy life indeed. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{CharName_13}'s Dad once
lost his shoe while
racing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard that {CharName_13}'s
mother is known as
a pretty famous {NextPage_1}announcer over in
the city. {NextPage_49}
Maybe I should get
her autograph? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{CharName_13} is a very
earnest person. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}All the females who
work in {CharName_16}'s
Dad's company have {NextPage_1}a very strong and
hard personality. {NextPage_49}
He must have a
hard time with
all of them. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_13}This is just between
us okay...? {NextPage_49}
It seems that {CharName_16}'s
Mom and {CharName_13}'s Mom
were once rivals. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_9}{34_1_169}I guess it's true
that women are
pretty catty. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_25}{CharName_16} doesn't
like chickens. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}When {CharName_17} takes
a look at {CharName_31}'s
bonsai, it seems he {NextPage_1}wants to say the
words "I've lost". {NextPage_49}
But I guess he
thinks that if he
says it, then that {NextPage_1}loss will become a
reality for him. {NextPage_49}
It's interesting
to watch... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I guess even the
great {CharName_19} can't
unlock the mysteries {NextPage_1}of how a woman's
heart works. {NextPage_49}
{34_1_170}{50_1_0_33}I'm sure he has
someone he likes
though... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}{CharName_20} is all
self-taught. {NextPage_49}
That must really
shake up pro
music teachers. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}{CharName_21} always
talks about going
"Back to Nature". {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_12}So then why does
he use metal...? {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_35}That's deep man... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_168}{50_1_0_13}This guy is thinking
dirty old man
thoughts again... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}They may be twins,
but their manner is
entirely different. {NextPage_49}
{CharName_23} is so
serious and moral,
but {CharName_22}{NextPage_1}is such a pervert. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{CharName_5} sometimes gets
Taro and Hanako
confused. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_7}{34_1_168}It must be really
hard to tell the
two apart... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}{CharName_26} doesn't
seem to want to
succeed {CharName_24} {NextPage_1}as the business owner
of the {2b_35}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}The reason why {CharName_25}'s
cooking is so good
is because she ate{NextPage_49}
a lot of really
good food. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Grandpa {CharName_7}'s
voice is cool. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard that {CharName_8}'s
storage room has
lots of treasures. {NextPage_49}
I'd like to sneak
in there and take a
peek sometime. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}Everyone who {CharName_9}
liked up to now has
been older than her. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{CharName_13}'s Dad once
lost his shoe while
racing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I heard that {CharName_13}'s
mother is known as
a pretty famous {NextPage_1}announcer over in
the city. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{CharName_13} is a very
earnest person. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}All the females who
work in {CharName_16}'s
Dad's company have {NextPage_1}a very strong and
hard personality. {NextPage_49}
He must have a
hard time with
all of them. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_13}This is just between
us okay...? {NextPage_49}
It seems that {CharName_16}'s
Mom and {CharName_13}'s Mom
were once rivals. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_9}{34_1_169}I guess it's true
that women are
pretty catty. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_30}I heard that {CharName_16}
has written over 100
books of poetry. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_1}{34_1_170}She's impressive. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}When {CharName_17} takes
a look at {CharName_31}'s
bonsai, it seems he {NextPage_1}wants to say the
words "I've lost". {NextPage_49}
But I guess he
thinks that if he
says it, then that {NextPage_1}loss will become a
reality for him. {NextPage_49}
It's interesting
to watch... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I guess even the
great {CharName_19} can't
unlock the mysteries {NextPage_1}of how a woman's
heart works. {NextPage_49}
{34_1_170}{50_1_0_33}I'm sure he has
someone he likes
though... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I wonder if
{CharName_20} will
sing for us today... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}{CharName_21} always
talks about going
"Back to Nature". {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_12}So then why does
he use metal...? {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_35}That's deep man... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_168}{50_1_0_13}This guy is thinking
dirty old man
thoughts again... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}They may be twins,
but their manner is
entirely different. {NextPage_49}
{CharName_23} is so
serious and moral,
but {CharName_22}{NextPage_1}is such a pervert. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{CharName_5} sometimes gets
Taro and Hanako
confused. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_7}{34_1_168}It must be really
hard to tell the
two apart... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}{CharName_26} doesn't
seem to want to
succeed {CharName_24} {NextPage_1}as the business owner
of the {2b_35}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Grandpa {CharName_7}
told me to
"be a man". {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
She said to come by
and visit anytime. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_10} does
all the housework
for {CharName_9}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Talking with
{CharName_10} makes
me sleepy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_11} told me
to I should run too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you get
your fortune told? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_13} is
kind of manly. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A tie and a suit
is like a sword
and armor. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
She's a bit of
a two-sided
person... {NextPage_49}
It's not that
I don't like
her but... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I got lectured
again. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_17} really
loves his mother. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_19}'s interesting. {NextPage_49}
I get to hear about
all his travels. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want a musical
instrument too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's cool when
{CharName_21}'s voice
gets deep. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_22} and
{CharName_23} look alike
but their{NextPage_1}personalities are so
completely different
from each other.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_23} would
still recognize me
even I was naked! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope Moi can go
home soon, but
I'd get lonely {NextPage_1}without him
around. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like to hear
stories about
journeys. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_25} always
seems to be
reminiscing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If {CharName_4} doesn't
come home then I
can't have any more {NextPage_1}interesting talks
with her. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He told me a lot of
things about the
town. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to drink
one of {CharName_27}'s
cocktails. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}'s cool. {NextPage_49}
I'd like to live
with someone that
cool. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_6} is
very knowledgeable. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I talk with
{CharName_28}, I zone
out. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I get worried when
{CharName_29} isn't
feeling good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_30} is really
cool. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want a cute little
brother just like
me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard another
gross story... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He can speak
English. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It would be nice if
{CharName_36} lived here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_7}{NextPage_1}{50_1_0_2}What? {NextPage_0}

{CharName_2}{NextPage_1}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's things that
even {CharName_31}
doesn't like. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_35}{NextPage_1}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_36}{NextPage_1}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is Grandpa {CharName_7}
married...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everyday {CharName_8}
twists up {CharName_10}'s
hair for him. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what {CharName_9}
would do if she got
married? {NextPage_49}
Can she even
cook...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_10} is
really tall!
He's so cool! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_13}'s Dad
can do any and every
sport there is! {NextPage_49}
That's awesome! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_13}'s Mom
is nice and young. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want to be as cool
as {CharName_13}... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if {CharName_16}'s
father would teach
me how to tie a tie.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_16}'s Mom
is a lot nicer than
she looks. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_30}{CharName_16}'s kind of
two-faced at home. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_13}I wonder if I
should tell her
parents...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_17}'s hat
usually falls off.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you go near
{CharName_19} he smells
of smoke. {NextPage_49}
I wonder what kind
of experiments he
does? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_12}I wonder if the
flower on {CharName_20}'s
head is real...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_21} lives in
a house that's
too small for him. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if {CharName_22}
likes his older
sister? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_23}'s hair
looks like very
brave! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_5} is a nice
person. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_24} and {CharName_25}
have very similar
personalities. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_24} and {CharName_25}
have very similar
personalities. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_4} is
really cool! {NextPage_49}
I wish I had a
sister like her! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_26} looks really
good! {NextPage_49}
I've got to learn
what he does! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want to hear
{CharName_27} play
guitar! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like {CharName_3}'s
style! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if {CharName_6}
would give me one of
those things that {NextPage_1}he wears around
his neck. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_28}'s always
wears shorts. {NextPage_49}
Doesn't she get
bit by insects? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_29} looks
very dependable! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I always wonder if
{CharName_30} resembles
Grandpa {CharName_7}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_2} is a very
warmhearted person. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_31}'s striped
underwear really
stands out. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Will {CharName_35}
come here...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm looking forward
to {CharName_36} coming! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's a lot of fun
people here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Talking with
Grandpa {CharName_7}
makes me realize how {NextPage_1}much there is to
adults. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think {CharName_8}
was beautiful when
she was younger. {NextPage_49}
She wouldn't have
any wrinkles or
white hair. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_9} would be
my dream sister. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everyone loves
{CharName_10} because
wherever he goes,{NextPage_1}he's always smiling.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_13}'s Dad is
incredible. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_13}'s Mom
is really young. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_13} is really
cool. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Does {CharName_16}'s
Dad sleep in those
clothes too? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes {CharName_16}'s
Mom doesn't make any
sense. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If {CharName_16} were
only a little more
reserved... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want to ask {CharName_17}
about when he was
young. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what
{CharName_19}'s
experiments are. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_20} and {CharName_27}
guitars have
different shapes. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_21}'s house
looks really hot. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_22}'s a
little scary but
interesting. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_23} is easier
to talk to then
{CharName_22}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what floats
around {CharName_5} all
the time...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whose cooking is
better?
{CharName_24} or {CharName_25}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_25} is a
very warm person. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes {CharName_4}
is frosty, but
it's kind of cool. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's fun to chat
with {CharName_26}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't hear
{CharName_27}'s guiar
until I grow up?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_3} always
smells nice. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Does {CharName_6}
plan on living in
that tent forever? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is {CharName_28}
planning to marry
{CharName_6}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_29} doesn't
look much like
{CharName_30}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_29} doesn't
look much like
{CharName_30}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_2} is
so lively. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_31} is a
little scary. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if {CharName_35}
is going to be
okay...{NextPage_49}
{CharName_19}'s got
his sights set on
him. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_36}
won't sell anything
to me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lots of people look
like they're fun
to talk to... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Grandpa {CharName_7}'s
stories teach me
more than yours. {NextPage_0}
