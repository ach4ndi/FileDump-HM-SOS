I think it's my
bedtime...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's very late...
Will you please head
on home? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, good night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I need to be going
soon, so...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really do need
to be going so...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See you another
time...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello.
Can I just take
look?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, can
you help me? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's too bad.
Everything is sold
out? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I've no other
choice than to come
back here again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, pay no mind
to me. {NextPage_49}
Sometimes I just
enjoy looking
around...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if there's
anything else here?
Hmm... Let's see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry to be a bother,
but I'm all set
for now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, well if it isn't
our new arrival,
{CharName_0}. {NextPage_49}
As you can see,
my husband and I are
old...{NextPage_49}
We live in this
valley quietly.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_2}......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_2}...Hah......
As you get old,
problems start to{NextPage_1}pile up. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_2}Yes, do you need
something from me...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_2}If you don't need
me for anything,
then I'd prefer {NextPage_1}to just be left
alone. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_97}Why, good morning to
you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_97}A very good
afternoon to you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_97}A good evening
to you dear. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_97}Good evening to
you dear. {NextPage_49}
But what on earth
are you doing up
this late at night? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_97}Oh my, {CharName_0}.
What are you doing
up this late? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_97}Oh my, {CharName_0}.
How nice of you
to come. {NextPage_49}
Please, make
yourself
comfortable. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_97}What brings you here
so late at night? {NextPage_49}
Is there something
the matter?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_97}Oh my, {CharName_0}.
Imagine meeting you
here of all places. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you're giving
this to me? {NextPage_49}
{50_18_0_3}Why, I don't know
what to say really.
It just happens to{NextPage_1}be my favorite.
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_96}{50_18_0_3}{34_1_96}Why, thank you,
thank you! {NextPage_49}
I'm really quite
grateful to you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_2}I see... That's too
bad, but it's your
choice...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, that's
my favorite. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmmmm...that's
very nice. {NextPage_49}
{50_18_0_3}Oh dear, you're
offering it to me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
I really do have
a bit of a weakness
for that...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_9}So sorry, but that
really isn't my
cup of tea dear...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I did like that
when I was younger...{NextPage_49}
But tastes change
as you get older.
I'm quite sorry. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't really
fancy that at all. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No matter which
way I look at it,
I don't like it. {NextPage_49}
Sorry dear. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_3}Oh, this is such a
cute one it is... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_3}Babies are so cute.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, dear, he's such
a cute little pup...{NextPage_49}
Animals keep the
heart soft and
caring...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_97}He really is a very
cute doggie...{NextPage_1}I wonder if I too
should get a dog? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_97}Oh, what kind of
seed is that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know what
kind of seed that
happens to be, but {NextPage_1}nevertheless, grow
some very healthy
crops from it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you took this
from your farm
did you? {NextPage_49}
It looks so fresh,
that it just
has to taste good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Got milk dear? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_96}{34_1_96}Oh dear, but that
looks delicious.{NextPage_49}
{50_18_0_3}Hmm? Oh is this for
me? {NextPage_1}{40_1_0}
----------x----------
Oh, my.
This does look quite
scrumptious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Does it work well?
Sorry, dear but
those things are {NextPage_1}positively lost
on an old woman
like me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, are you off to
till your fields? {NextPage_49}
You're such a
hard worker
you know. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know what they
say, "Practice makes
perfect". {NextPage_49}
The more you use it,
the easier it will
be for you. {NextPage_49}
Not quite the same
for us old folk. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is this a good
sickle? {NextPage_49}
Sorry dear, but
those things are
positively lost {NextPage_1}on an old woman
like me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's just plain
common sense...{NextPage_49}
You don't swing a
sickle around in
a place like this. {NextPage_49}
Do be careful,
dear. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When someone says
watering can
around me, all I {NextPage_1}can think of is
my husband's
bonsai trees. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you using that
to take care of your
bonsai, too? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What in the world
is that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmmm...
So that's a machine
for cows is it? {NextPage_49}
I heard that thing
can milk well. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are...clippers.
Careful with those.
They're dangerous. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's for cutting
sheep hair? {NextPage_49}
Careful you don't
lose an arm or
something. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of tool
is that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The more you use a
tool, the easier it
becomes for you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I may be on in years,
but jewelry still
catches my heart...{NextPage_49}
What kind of stone
is that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmmm, it's a very
unique stone...{NextPage_49}
It's got to be a
rough of some high
quality gem.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_96}Ooooh...
That's quite
amazing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where did you happen
to pick that up? {NextPage_49}
It's kind of
exciting, isn't it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of plant
is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't really know
that too well. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that you've
got there? {NextPage_49}
It looks like a
big black cookie. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you going
to do with that
black cookie? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that you've
got there? {NextPage_49}
Is it some kind of
seasoning? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you use that in
your cooking, you can
make some great food.{NextPage_49}
If you do I hope
that I'll be lucky
enough to get some.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}Oooooh, that's a
very strange sound. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}That's quite an
interesting sound. {NextPage_49}
Wherever did you
find such a thing? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of medal
is that? {NextPage_49}
Hmm? I think I've
seen that before. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have never earned
a medal in my life.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, why it's a
necklace. {NextPage_49}
It's not really
my cup of tea dear.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If I was just a
little younger, it
might suit me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of book
is that? {NextPage_49}
The characters are
really close
together and small. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah, is that sheet
music for an
instrument? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh my, what type of
bomb is that you
have? {NextPage_49}
Hey, are you in your
right mind, dear? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's...a firework?
Don't play tricks
on a poor old lady. {NextPage_49}
My heart almost
stopped it did. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're giving this
to me? {NextPage_49}
That's okay, it's
the thought that
counts really. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_96}Hmm?
Are you giving that
to someone? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We used to live in
the city, Galen
and I. {NextPage_49}
But we're getting on
in years, and so we
both decided to {NextPage_1}come here to this
Valley to retire
in peace and quiet. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He may be stubborn
at times, but I know
that he always has {NextPage_1}me as his priority
in all that he does. {NextPage_49}
I'm very grateful
for all he is to me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Since we've come
to the valley, he's
always helped me. {NextPage_49}
We plan on being
together like that
till the end. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_3}I loved that food I
got before. It was
really delicious. {NextPage_49}
Thank you dear. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_2}I really wasn't too
fond of the food
I got last time. {NextPage_49}
Sorry for your
trouble. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} from
before had a very...
interesting taste. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} I
got from before was
not bad at all. {NextPage_49}
I hope you'll bring
me some more in the
near future. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_3}That {29_0} from
before was really
delicious. {NextPage_49}
Thank you so much
for thinking of me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_3}That {29_0} from
before is actually
my favorite food. {NextPage_49}
Thank you dear. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I couldn't tell what
type of milk that
was from before, {NextPage_1}but it really
didn't agree with
me at all dear. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought the milk
you gave me last
time was alright. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_10}I couldn't tell what
type of milk that
was from before, {NextPage_1}but I really loved
the taste! Thanks! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_3}I'm not too clear on
what kind of milk it
was, but it had {NextPage_1}an absolutely
wonderful taste.
Thank you much! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I couldn't tell what
type of milk that
was from before, {NextPage_1}but it had a slight
odor to it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not too clear on
what kind of milk it
was, but I really{NextPage_1}fancied it. It did
smell a tad, though. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_10}I couldn't tell what
type of cheese that
was from before, {NextPage_1}but it was very
tasty. Thank you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that
cheese I had before,
didn't you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_10}I couldn't tell what
type of cheese that
was from before, {NextPage_1}it was very
delicious dear,
thank you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that butter
you gave me last
time, didn't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_10}The food I had
before tasted very
good. {NextPage_49}
Thank you so much
dear for bringing
it to me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_10}That food from
last time...{NextPage_49}
I can't put my
finger on it, but
it was...{NextPage_49}
Well, anyway
thank you dear. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everyday you work
so hard. {NextPage_49}
You've become quite
dependable. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I do believe you're
getting the hang of
the farm life dear. {NextPage_49}
You're still so
young that if you
work hard, you can {NextPage_1}really do amazing
things with your
life. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So much time has
passed since we've
come here...{NextPage_49}
This valley is such
a wonderful place
to live. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The longer I live in
this valley, the more
I come to appreciate{NextPage_1}living in a place
like this. {NextPage_49}
It's so separated
from everything, but
very nice...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've really come to
fancy this valley...{NextPage_49}
I'd like to be
buried here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, make yourself
comfortable.{NextPage_49}
Enjoy the peace and
quiet of the
country. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't hesitate.
Just make yourself
at home. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel so at peace
here. I'm really
very lucky. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You like it
here too right?
Why, of course. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_10}Spring always makes
me remember coming
here with Galen. {NextPage_49}
The flowers were
beautiful then
too...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This valley is
such an easy place
for old folks like {NextPage_1}us to sit back and
relax. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh my, it's quite
hot now isn't it? {NextPage_1}But compared to
other places, the
valley is cool. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So hot...
It really affects
us old folks...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is a nice time
of year. {NextPage_49}
Not hot, not cold.
It's the best for
my old body...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This season tends to
make me feel sad. {NextPage_49}
I wonder if it's
because I'm
getting older...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's grown quite
cold hasn't it? {NextPage_49}
But compared to
other places, the
valley is warm. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's so c-cold.
This season is the
hardest on the old. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_10}Hugh is really cute,
isn't he? He's a
handful, but that{NextPage_1}makes him even
lovable.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_10}Every time I look at
Hugh, he reminds me
of my grandchildren{NextPage_1}in the city... I
wonder how they are
doing...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_10}I love Hugh just as
my own grandson.
He's a dear boy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Van always brings
us tools...{NextPage_49}
His wares are nice,
inexpensive and
always help us. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you buy a lot of
things from Van? {NextPage_49}
Without him the
valley would be
in trouble. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Vesta always brings
us some fruits and
vegetables.{NextPage_49}
She helps us out
a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Vesta always brings
us some fruits and
vegetables.{NextPage_49}
She helps us out
a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Actually,
you can keep it
this time. {NextPage_0}
