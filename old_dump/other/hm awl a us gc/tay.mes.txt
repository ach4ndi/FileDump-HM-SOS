Good job.
You both worked very hard.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello, {CharName_0}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You saw that, did you?
How embarrassing.{NextPage_49}
It's was so long ago.
We took that picture when we went
to a country far to the south.{NextPage_49}
We were so young, then...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's right.
We got this from somebody on
our trip.{NextPage_49}
It's yours, if you'd like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We don't use it, so if you think
you can, you're welcome to it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_0}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.............{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK then. If you see {CharName_4}, tell
her that we went looking for her. She just
left her rent behind and disappeared.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_4} just left her rent money behind
and left, but that's no way to do things.
Do you think she's gone already?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello, {CharName_0}...{NextPage_1}You couldn't find her, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um... {CharName_4}...
About that money you left in your room...
It was the exact amount of your rent so...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_4}, you shouldn't tease us like that.
Well, that's a relief.
Come on, Ruby. Cook something up for her.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_4}...{NextPage_49}
There was a telephone call from your
father last night. I told him how much
we enjoyed having you with us.{NextPage_49}
I asked if he wanted to talk to you, but
he said no and hung up. I hope that's OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's right.
That letter's for you.
Go ahead and open it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What happened all of a sudden?
Well, I'm sure it'll be all right.
There must be some reason.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um... Nami?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please take good care of {CharName_26}.
He's just like a son to us.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take care of yourself.
We loved having you at our inn.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Of course.
Didn't I say you were like our son,
{CharName_26}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, are you here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry for coming so early like this.
But I have something to ask you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The truth is that {CharName_4} is planning
on leaving today.
What do you think of that, {CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, I heard that you
proposed to {CharName_4}.{NextPage_49}
But {CharName_4} said that she regrets
turning you down.{NextPage_49}
So if you still feel the same way,
I thought...
{41_2_0}Propose to her.
Don't marry anyone.
----------x----------
Why, that's a Blue Feather.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've never seen one before.
They're so rare.
So you managed to find one, eh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, that's great.
I have to go tell Ruby.
I'm going to home now, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh yes of course.
Well, let's go.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
You're not going to marry anyone?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The truth is that {CharName_4} is planning
on leaving today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_4}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Of course we want {CharName_4} to
stay at our inn.{NextPage_49}
But I'm afraid we just can't afford
to keep a non-paying customer. But
I thought maybe you might be able to help.{NextPage_49}
Luckily, {CharName_4} seems to like you,
and you like her.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Er, I thought you did...
{41_2_0}Live together.
Stay single forever.
----------x----------
Great! Isn't that wonderful, {CharName_4}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
Single... forever? I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, I heard that you
proposed to {CharName_4}.{NextPage_49}
{CharName_4} said that she regrets
turning you down.
That's why I brought her here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What can I do for you today?
{41_2_0}I came to see {CharName_4}.
I came to talk with you.
----------x----------
Oh really!
Thank you very much.{NextPage_49}
{CharName_4} hasn't been very cheerful
recently, so we've been worried about her.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_4}....{32_3_32}
----------x----------
Oh dear, she's not here.
I'm sorry, {CharName_0}, but you've
got to help {CharName_4}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please try and cheer her up!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh? You want to talk to me?
Well, that's nice of you.{NextPage_49}
To tell you the truth, I am a little
worried about how {CharName_4}'s been
acting recently. She seems so depressed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_4} sure was
acting strange!{NextPage_49}
{CharName_0}, I'm sorry but do you
think you could try and cheer
{CharName_4} up for me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello {CharName_0}.
Welcome.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Uh, yeah...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sure... Whatever you say...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_2}What's all the
fuss about...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}Hmm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Welcome back, {CharName_4}.
You've come home!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Hahaha. {CharName_25} will be so happy.{NextPage_49}
{50_24_0_0}Come on inside.
Your room is just as you left it.{NextPage_49}
{50_24_0_3}I think I've told you before, but we
want you to think of this as your home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_0}.
You have very good timing...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_4} left her rent money behind
and just disappeared.{NextPage_49}
Do you think she might have left
us for good?{NextPage_49}
I'm sorry, but if you see {CharName_4},
could you tell her we're looking for her?
{41_2_0}I understand.
I'll go look for her.
----------x----------
{CharName_0}...
I know it's early, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
R-really?!
Well that's just... Thank you!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It makes me feel better to hear
you say that. Well then, could you go and
check the places {CharName_4} might go?{NextPage_49}
We'll split up and look ourselves.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}...
What is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You couldn't find her, huh?
Do you think she might already have left?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}...
You went too soon.{32_7_208}{NextPage_1}Leave {CharName_1} to us
and rest in peace.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, could you
sing a song for our dearly departed
friend, {CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to be heading for bed soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's my bedtime, so could you
be moving along?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well then. Good night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Actually, I'm going to be leaving
pretty soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry.
I have to go out now.
So if you don't mind...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So long...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pardon me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, do you have a minute?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}Oh, that's too bad. I guess you just
sold out of everything.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I'd better come back some other
time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I was just hoping you might have some
good ingredients we could use for cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't mind me.
I'm just looking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm...
You don't seem to have ingredients that
would be good for serving at the inn.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is this all you have?
Hmm....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}Oh, what about this?
{34_1_117}Well, maybe not...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Umm....
No, I guess not.
Sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you came by a while ago, didn't you?
{CharName_0}, wasn't it?
How do you like Forget-Me-Not Valley?{NextPage_49}
To tell you the truth, I've traveled
all over the world and somehow I wound
up running this inn here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}........Sigh.......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just... Hmm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_4}...........!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_4}I'm sorry, but I'm busy right now.
Could you make it another time?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good morning.
I hope you have a wonderful day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello.
How's your work coming along?{NextPage_49}
Me? Oh, I'm fair to middlin' as
they say...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good evening.
My, when you're busy the time
just flies by, doesn't it?{NextPage_49}
Well, I'm not usually very busy,
to tell you the truth...
Just sometimes...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello, {CharName_0}.
You're up late.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello, {CharName_0}.
Welcome.
It's pretty late. Are you here for a room?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello, {CharName_0}.
Welcome.
We always like to have guests here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, what a coincidence meeting you now.
What are you doing here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello, {CharName_0}.
I didn't expect to meet you
here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um... Could I have that by any chance?
I just love that kind of thing.
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Oh, thank you!
I'm looking forward to eating this.
I'm so happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}Oh, I see.
I'm sorry.
Please don't give it another thought.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's one of my favorites.
I've traveled the world and sampled many
delicacies, so I'm particular about food.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks very good.
No, really.
I can hear my stomach growling.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got to stay at our inn sometime.
My wife will cook something nice for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's the ingredients that make or break
the dish, so I choose them very carefully.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Ooh, you've got something nice there.
No, I know about these things.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}I just love that kind of thing.
It's embarrassing but true.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}Hmm.
I'm not a very picky eater, but I just
can't stand that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}No, you can show it to me as many
times as you like. I still don't want it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}I'm not a picky person, but...
I'm afraid I just can't stomach that kind
of thing. I'm sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, look at that...
{50_24_0_7}I'm afraid I'm not very interested,
though. I'm sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}Really...
No matter how many times you show that
to me, I don't want it. Sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Well well.
What a cute child.
Looks a lot like you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Children are so cute.
Even our Rock was pretty cute when
he was younger...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Hey {CharName_1}, how're you doing?
Rock was the same when he was younger...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Kids are always so healthy and energetic.
Rock was so healthy when he was younger.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Well, well.
What a well behaved child.
Looks a lot like you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well behaved children must be easy to
raise. Our Rock was quite a handful
even when he was very young...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Well hello there.
That looks like a very intelligent
dog to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}...Um.
To tell you the truth, I don't like dogs.{NextPage_49}
Hm? Well, that is...
I guess I should say that I'm kind
of scared of them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}I know I shouldn't be afraid of
dogs, as big as I am.
I'm so embarrassed...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Well, what a cute cat.
How nice. I feel relaxed just looking
at it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}I've been all over the world and seen
all kinds of cats, but...
They're all cute, aren't they?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Cat cuteness remains a
kind of like an international language.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Is that one of your chickens?
Why, it looks just delic-- I mean, its
looks like it would lay nice eggs.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If it does lay some good eggs, we
could certainly use them at the inn.
If the price is right, that is.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Well well.
What a delic-- I mean handsome
looking duck you have there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know, there's a place where
they eat big fat ducks flame
broiled.{NextPage_49}
But when I actually went there,
it was too expensive for me to eat.
It sure looked good though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That looks like a good seed.
Oh, we grow some food of our own, so
I know about these things.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope it grows well. I'm sure we could
use it at the inn when you harvest it.
If the price is right, that is.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Well, did you grow that yourself?
It turned our very nicely.
Yes, I think you did very well indeed.{NextPage_49}
Oh, is it for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
Hmm...
That looks very good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are all kinds of crops.
We try to use as many as possible at our
inn to expand our menu.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that milk from your farm?
It looks nice and fresh.{NextPage_49}
Oh, is it for me?
{40_1_1}{40_1_0}
----------x----------
Milk is good for you.
I'd like my wife Ruby to drink more of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk looks very fresh.
And good too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that cheese yourself?
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_3}Very impressive!
It looks quite tasty.{NextPage_49}
Oh, is it for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
Now this is a surprise.
You don't find many cheeses like this
anywhere in the world.{NextPage_49}
No, I'm serious.
And I've traveled all over the world,
so I know what I'm talking about.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, that cheese certainly looks tasty.
You must have used good milk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, that cheese certainly looks tasty.
I'd like to serve it at our inn.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, that cheese certainly looks tasty.
I wish my wife Ruby would try some.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that butter yourself?
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_3}...Yes, it smells very good.{NextPage_49}
Oh, is it for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
That butter looks very good.
I'd love to serve some dishes made with
this butter at our inn.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter looks very good.
I'd love to serve some dishes made with
this butter at our inn.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dishes made with butter are very tasty,
aren't they? The ones my Ruby makes are so
good that I end up overeating.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did one of your chickens lay that
egg?
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_3}It must be very fresh.{NextPage_49}
Oh, is it for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
There are all kinds of egg dishes in
the world, and they're all delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
By the way, my Ruby's best egg
dish is...{NextPage_49}
Fried eggs! Anyone can make that, you say?
No, they're totally different from normal
fried eggs. You should try them.{NextPage_49}
Although now that I think about it,
she hasn't made them recently...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
One of the most delicious egg dishes I
ever at was called a “Katsu-don.”
Have you ever had that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, did you catch that fish?
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_3}That looks very good indeed.{NextPage_49}
Oh, is it for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
That looks quite good.
I can't clean fish or anything, but it's
a piece of cake for Ruby.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's see, you could put that fish into
a stew, roast it, or even make it into
Sashimi. I'm sure it'd be quite good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, that fish looks quite good. I wonder
what kind of dish it would be best in...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, is that a wild plant from around here?
I looks good... I guess.
Can those be used in cooking?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are many kinds of wild plants,
and some of them are dangerous. You should
be careful, even if it looks tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I think most of the things you
can find in Forget-Me-Not Valley are
safe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks very good...
...I guess.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_3}Well, that looks delicious.
I'm something of a gourmet, and that looks
just great.{NextPage_49}
Oh, is it for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
Using good ingredients is one of the
basics of good cooking.{NextPage_49}
By the way, I do the grocery buying
for our inn.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Yes, that looks delicious.
My Ruby's a great cook, but this could
give her a run for her money.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That's a pretty good hoe you've got there.
Yes.
Very good indeed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going to work in the fields now?
That sounds like hard work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You pay a lot of attention to your tools,
don't you? I'm always impressed by that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's the hoe I gave you.
How's it working out for you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That's a pretty good sickle you've got.
We don't have one nearly as nice as that.
I'm a little envious, to be honest.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}I'm sure you realize this, but
it's dangerous to wave that around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That looks like a nice watering can.
We don't have one nearly as nice as that.
I'm a little jealous, to be honest.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's kind of an odd shape.
Is it easy to use?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an unusual watering can.
Maybe it's a collector's item.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Who gave you that?
I think I've seen it somewhere before.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, is that a new watering can?
You use that in your fields do you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've used that watering can a fair
amount. You use it every day?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}You're not planning on watering anything
around here, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}You've certainly used that watering can
a lot. I guess you must use it
every day in your fields.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}What an old watering can.
But it does look very easy to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a machine for milking cows?
That must be convenient.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Milk is tasty and good for you too.
I'm jealous. On a farm you can always
drink fresh milk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}I don't think there are any cows
around here...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Clippers?
Oh, you use those to shear your sheep?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wool is used all over the
world, you know.
It's nice and warm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't see clippers like that
much anymore.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are new clippers, aren't they?
So you're going to use those to
shear your sheep from now on?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How are those clippers? You seem to
have used them a fair amount.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You use those to shear your sheep?
{50_24_0_3}You know, I like
wool quite a bit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Those clippers are pretty old.
I'm surprised they still work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
New tools can be hard to use at first,
but if you don't keep using them they'll
never get any easier to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It always makes me feel good to get
a new tool.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The more you use your tools, the
easier they'll be to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you use your tools well, they'll
make your work a lot easier.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_3}Well, that certainly is a well used tool.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Whenever I see a well-used tool, I think
of all the work that it must have done.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_12}Hmm... Is that some kind of
rare stone? I know there are all kinds
of stones in the world.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_12}I really don't know much
about that kind of thing, though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_3}Wow...
I don't know what it is, but it definitely
looks impressive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't suppose you'd be willing to
give that to me, would you?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Thank you.
I'll take good care of it.{NextPage_49}
I thought maybe I'd display it in
the inn.
Do you think Ruby would object?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_7}I see...
That's too bad, but I understand.
Don't give it another thought.{NextPage_49}
I thought I'd put it in the inn, but I
suppose Ruby would object anyway.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess you found that around here, huh?
I suppose it could be good in a salad.
But I don't normally eat those.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear that some of the wild flowers
here have mysterious properties...
...I'm not sure what that means, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}That flower is... Err...
I'm sorry.
I don't know anything about flowers.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a pretty flower.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_3}Oh, a record?
Don't see many of those.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of record is that?
I used to listen to those a long time ago.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A record, huh? I used to listen
to those when I lived in the city.
Not since we moved here, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm kind of ashamed to admit it, but
Ruby and I have a special song we like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_3}That's an unusual spice.
Oh, you got it from Ruby?
I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can use that to make some
delicious dishes.
They're a little spicy, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Ruby used to use that spice in
all kinds of dishes.
Well, she still does, actually.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_66}{32_5_220}{34_1_117}Hmm. That's an odd sound.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_66}{32_5_220}{34_1_117}I've seen instruments from all over the
world, but I've never heard that before.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_12}Yep.
That's a very unusual drum.
Where did you get it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_3}Well, that's a very
pretty medal you have.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you win that in some kind of
race or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know, I once won a medal in an
international track and field competition.
What, you don't believe me?{NextPage_49}
OK, so it was an eating contest
instead of track and field.
They're pretty similar, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}Hey... Come to think of it, I think
I've seen that medal somewhere before...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_12}Well, that's an unusual
necklace.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are all kinds of unusual necklaces
in the world. I've even seen ones made of
tiny skulls strung together.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}But that certainly is an
unusual necklace all right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_12}Is that some sheet music
you've got there?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry, I don't know how to
read music.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going to use that sheet music
to play me something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_12}Is that a firecracker?
That's pretty big.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
In fireworks shows around the world, they
use hundreds of those things.
It must be pretty expensive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be sure and tell me when you're going
to set that off.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a present for me?
No thanks, but I appreciate
the sentiment.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No, I really couldn't.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_12}Oh, are you going to give it
to somebody else?
Then why show it to me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that a present for someone?
There's no point in showing it to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_12}I run the inn here, but I'm not
really sure that I'm cut out for it.
Sometimes I worry about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}I used to be a world traveler, but
somehow I ended up living here.{NextPage_49}
I started out by providing rooms for my
fellow travelers, so running an inn
seemed the natural next step. I guess...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My inn is filled with interesting objects
that I've collected on my travels around
the world. I think you'll like them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know why my Ruby's cooking is so
good? Well, a long time ago there was a
cooking contest. One of the judges said{NextPage_49}
Ruby's cooking was bad.
Ruby got really mad and swore to improve
her skills and be the best in the world.{NextPage_49}
I think that judge's name was
Gourmet Man...
Pretty annoying name, don't you think?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That thing you gave me
was amazingly good.
Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}Um... This is hard to say, but...
That thing you gave me is one
of my least favorite foods.{NextPage_49}
I'm sorry. I know you went to a
lot of trouble to give it to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}That {29_0} you gave me
tasted a little off to me.
I'm sorry to be so picky.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}The {29_0} you gave me
was pretty good.
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That {29_0} was the best!
I've been all over the world, but
I've never had one that good!{NextPage_49}
Thank you.
Ruby was impressed, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That {29_0} you gave me was
one of my favorites. I really enjoyed it.
Thank you very much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That milk you gave me was
very good.
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}About that milk you gave me...
I don't mean to be rude, but that was...
Er... Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}About that milk you gave me...
I don't mean to be rude, but it, uh...
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That milk you gave me was
pretty good.
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That milk you gave me was
incredibly delicious.
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}About that milk you gave me...
I don't mean to be rude, but that was...
Er... Oh, nothing...{NextPage_49}
...Maybe that kind of milk is best
turned it into cheese?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}That milk you gave me was...
Well... That is to say...{NextPage_49}
Yep. That's about the size of it....
...Maybe that kind of milk is best
turned it into cheese?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That milk you gave me was
pretty good.
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_49}
Although... I bet if you made it into
cheese it'd be even better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That milk you gave me was
was incredibly delicious!
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_49}
Although... I bet if you made it into
cheese it'd be even better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That milk you gave me tasted
very expensive and delicious, but
it did seem a little weak.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That milk you gave me was
was pretty good.
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That milk you gave me was
was rich and very delicious.
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That milk you gave me was
just fantastic!
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}That milk you gave me was...
Well... That is to say...
Oh, nothing...{NextPage_49}
Maybe that kind of milk is best
turned into butter.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}That milk you gave me was...
Well... That is to say...{NextPage_49}
Yep. That's about the size of it......
Maybe that kind of milk is best
turned into butter?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That milk you gave me was
was pretty good.
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_49}
You know, if you made it into butter, I
bet it'd be even better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That milk you gave me was
just fantastic!
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_49}
But it did seem a tad
strong to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}About that milk you gave me...
I don't mean to be rude, but that was...
Er... A little on the smelly side...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me was
was pretty good.
It was a little smelly, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That cheese you gave me
was rich and very delicious.
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That cheese you gave me
smelled a little, but it was very good.
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That cheese you gave me
is very hard to come by, isn't it?
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that cheese you gave me,
right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That butter you gave me was
rich and very delicious.
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That butter you gave me
smelled a little, but it was very good.
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That butter you gave me
is very hard to come by, isn't it?
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that butter you gave me,
right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}The {29_0} you gave me was
just fantastic!
Thank you very much!{NextPage_49}
You know, I might like it even
better than my wife Ruby's
cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That dish you gave me
was pretty good.
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_49}
It's right up there with my
wife Ruby's cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That fish you caught was
the best!
Thank you very much!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That fish you caught was
pretty good.
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}You seem to be working hard every day.
Well done.
No really. You're a real farmer now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}I've heard you're very good at growing
crops? Well done.
Grow us lots of nice vegetables, you hear?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}I heard that your cooking is very good.
That's just great.
Maybe you're better than my Ruby.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}You seem to be working hard every day.
Well done.
Yes, you do seem a little different now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Do you often cook at home?
I've heard rumors that you're pretty good.
Of course, maybe not as good as my Ruby...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You seem to have gotten used to work
on the farm.
Keep up the good work. We're behind you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You seem to have gotten used to growing
crops.
Keep up the good work. We're behind you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You seem to have gotten used to
cooking.
Keep up the good work. We're behind you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to go traveling again someday.
What do you think about that?
{41_2_1}You should stay with your inn.
Travel is nice.
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}You think so?
But I think I'm really more suited
to being a traveler.{NextPage_49}
Although I must say that I do like
Forget-Me-Not Valley an awful lot...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Oh! You think so too!
Yes, travel is very nice indeed!
I love going to different countries!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm... Running the inn can be fun
in its own way, but the idea of traveling
is very attractive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've been all over the world, but
there are lots of places that I haven't
been yet...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}I like to kick back and relax with a drink
every once in a while.
Care to join me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My favorite is the {13}Moon Trip{17}.
{50_24_0_3}I've been a lot of places, but I'd
love to go on a Moon Trip!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}This is kind of fun.
Drink up, {CharName_0}.
Enjoy yourself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}We have lots of things in our
lobby.
Don't you think it's fun?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My wife Ruby and I aren't exactly slim,
but we're nothing compared to Van!
I wonder if we could get him on a diet?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_9}I've been feeling tired just from
walking recently.
I guess I should go on a diet...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Do you have some business
here, too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}The flowers are pretty, aren't they?
I always feel so good on days like this.
And feeling good stimulates my appetite.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}I always feel good at this time of year.
And feeling good stimulates my appetite.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
In some places it's a blazing desert all
all year, and others are always covered in
snow. But I like to see seasons change.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't you just love how there are so
many different foods to enjoy, depending
on the season?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}Hmmm....
I'd like to eat something cool.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}I can't stand the heat.
I could really go for some ice cream
right about now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I always have a big appetite at
this time of year.
Yes, bigger than usual...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's nice and cool outside. It feels good.
And feeling good stimulates my appetite.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}Cold?
No, I'm just fine.
But I wouldn't mind a hot drink.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}Hmm...
This kind of weather makes me want to
eat something hot like stew.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The food my Ruby makes is just
divine.
Don't you agree?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}My Ruby's cooking is the best!
And I've been all over the world tasting
different dishes, so you can believe me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}Sometimes I get the feeling that the crops
from our little garden are disappearing.
You seen anything strange around there?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}Maybe I'm imagining it.
But it certainly seems like the crops in
our garden are disappearing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've seen all kinds of strange foods in
the city, you know.
For example...{NextPage_49}
Crushed ice with syrup on top.
And fried frog's legs...
Those are pretty good, actually.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Vegetables from a farm are just great.
They taste good and are good for you, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Back when I was traveling the world, I
saw all kinds of unusual things.{NextPage_49}
People who dance wearing almost nothing
but masks,{NextPage_49}
Or even countries that have iron horses
and iron birds that fly the skies...
Yes, the world is a big place all right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Have you noticed things from our
collection displayed around the inn?
We're very proud of them.{NextPage_49}
That, oh and this over here...
They were all very hard to come by.{NextPage_49}
{50_24_0_7}But Rock ended up breaking our
most precious vase. I don't know what
we're going to do with that boy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um... I'm sorry, but I think we'd
better make it another time.
But I appreciate the offer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_9}I can't stand this weather.
I never feel like going anywhere on days
like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you walk around in wet clothes,
you'll catch cold.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that {29_0} from Mineral
Town has a dog that's really good
at catching frisbees...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that {29_0} from Mineral
Town has won the horse race
10 times...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is a chicken festival, anyway?
Oh, I just heard that the farmer from
Mineral Town won it 10 times.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that {29_0} from Mineral
Town has won the cow festival
10 times.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is a sheep festival, anyway?
Oh, I just heard that {29_0} from
Mineral Town won it 10 times.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, don't worry about it. It's best
just to leave these things alone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey Ruby...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}I know it's a little late to be asking,
but are you sure you're happy with me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was nothing but a traveler when we met.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When we arrived here, I decided
to stay.{NextPage_1}And you.
You stayed with me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}Ruby.{NextPage_1}You don't have to go on.
That's enough.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That's right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't have to say anything.
We both know just how you feel,
Nami.{NextPage_0}
