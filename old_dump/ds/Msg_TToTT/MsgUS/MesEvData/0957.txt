\u1f40\u1fac\u1f49\u2135This is my sweet darling,\u2328Dakota!
\u1f40\u1fac\u1f48\u2135She was born when I was\u2328only 5 years old.\u2328\u232bAnd I've ridden her ever\u2328since!\u232b\u1f40\u1fac\u1f49\u2135I reckon she's the best\u2328friend I've got.
\u1f40\u1fac\u1f4a\u2135That fool Kana from Konohana\u2328can't hold a candle to us!
\u1f40\u1fac\u1f4b\u2135Oh, sorry. I get a little\u2328hot under the collar when\u2328it comes to that fella.\u232b\u1f40\u1fac\u1f4a\u2135He runs the ranch over in\u2328Konohana.\u232bWe've got a bit of a rivalry\u2328going. We're always arguing\u2328about our horses.\u232bWhy, the other day, he\u2328said that his horse was\u2328cuter than Dakota!
\u1f40\u1fac\u1f4a\u2135Now I know there's no horse\u2328in the wide world as cute\u2328as my Dakota!\u232b\u1f40\u1fac\u1f49\u2135Isn't the right,\u2328Dakota?
\u2332 Who cares?\u2328 She really is cute.
\u1f40\u1fac\u1f48\u2135What now?\u2328Did you say something?\u2328I couldn't...HEY!
\u1f40\u1fac\u1f4c\u2135Dakota!\u2328What's gotten into you!?\u2328Now stop that, y'hear?
\u1f40\u1fac\u1f4c\u2135Now why would you\u2328go wild like that?\u2328Calm down.
\u1f40\u1fac\u1f4c\u2135Oh, I'm sorry . I can't\u2328imagine what got into her.\u2328I'm going to put her inside.\u232b\u1f40\u1fac\u1f48\u2135See you later, \u232a.
\u1f40\u1fac\u1f48\u2135Oh! Dakota?\u2328\u232bWhy, she's taken a real\u2328shine to you, \u232a.\u2328\u232b\u1f40\u1fac\u1f49\u2135You've really got a way\u2328with animals.\u2328\u232bI guess that's to be\u2328expected for a farmer.
\u1f40\u1fac\u1f48\u2135I surely am glad I invited\u2328you over, \u232a.\u232bI hope you'll come and visit\u2328Dakota again soon.\u232bI know she'd like that!\u2328
