Oh!
You came just in time!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You see{u_0086}{2d} I received
this invitation to a duel...{NextPage_49}
But I don't want to go.{NextPage_49}
Would you mind going in
my place?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Forget it.
Why should I go for you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well...You want to go to
Asatsuyu Village{u_0086}{2d} don't you?{NextPage_49}
Takako is the one who sent
the invitation{u_0086}{2d} and she's also
the one blocking the path.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?!!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's right.
Here it is.
Thanks...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um....
Are you Takako?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's right.
And just who are you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I{u_0086}{2d} um.{32_0_100}.{32_0_100}.{32_0_100}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That invitation!
So Yoko's chickened out{u_0086}{2d} eh?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know why you two are
fighting{u_0086}{2d} but sending
        invitations? Really!{NextPage_49}
And by the way{u_0086}{2d} it's not
very nice of you to block
        the path here...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you know about it?!
I'm not moving until you bring
Yoko here!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?!
I can't do that!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Go back to Yoko's place...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I met Takako{u_0086}{2d} but she says
she won't move until you
        come and see her.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh come on.
Takako's a pushover!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Then why don't you go
and handle her yourself...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm busy!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you mean{u_0086}{2d} busy?
You don't look it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?
Heh...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Anyway{u_0086}{2d} what's the story
behind this invitation?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh{u_0086}{2d} didn't I tell you? We're
fighting over some food I
gave Takako.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Food???{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's right.{NextPage_49}
It was Takako's birthday{u_0086}{2d} so
I made her some food.{NextPage_49}
But apparently she really
hated it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's not like I did it on purpose
or anything{u_0086}{2d} but she got so
upset!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It must've been pretty bad...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey! I'm proud of my cooking!{NextPage_49}
I'm never going to see Takako
again!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No!! You have to!{NextPage_49}
I have to get past her!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Teehee ☆{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh very well then.{NextPage_49}
I'll go{u_0086}{2d} but you have to
help me out a bit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Help you with what?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
First{u_0086}{2d} I need you to ask Takako
what kind of food she likes.{NextPage_49}
If I could just give her some
food she likes{u_0086}{2d} everything'll
be fine.... I think.☆{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
By myself?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Of course!
Now go on! Go!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're back{u_0086}{2d} huh?
I don't see Yoko...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No{u_0086}{2d} she's not here.
I returned the invitation{u_0086}{2d} too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm...
Then what do you want
with me?{NextPage_49}
I told you{u_0086}{2d} I'm not moving
from this spot until Yoko
gets here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just had something
I wanted to ask you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was just wondering what
your favorite food was.
        You're hungry{u_0086}{2d} right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now that you mention it{u_0086}{2d} I am
a little hungry... I got so
upset because of that...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes{u_0086}{2d} I understand!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well...
I'm in the mood for some
{Location_128_29_128}{_d8}lmon{17}.{NextPage_49}
You'll find many of them near
the bridge located in
northeast of the mountain{NextPage_49}
lake.  Good luck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wait just a minute!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
(Catch a {Location_128_29_128}{_d8}lmon{17} and bring
it to Yoko!){NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've been gone a long time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I caught a {Location_128_29_128}{_d8}lmon{17}.{NextPage_49}
If you cook something with it{u_0086}{2d}
Takako will forgive you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Location_128_29_128}{_d8}lmon{17}?
Takako does like Salmon...{NextPage_49}
All right then.
I'll cook it.☆{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's done! ☆☆☆
A special {Location_128_29_128}{_d8}lmon{17} dish{u_0086}{2d}

----------x----------
Yoko!!
So you're here at last!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now now. Don't glare at me
like that. It's scary.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's all your fault...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yoko{u_0086}{2d} give it to her.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Y-you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Takako! I have something to
make up for my first present!
This time it'll be OK!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How is it?
Good{u_0086}{2d} huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
All right then.
I guess I'll forgive you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Heh. See{u_0086}{2d} she's a pushover.☆{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yoko!!!
You always have to say one word
too many{u_0086}{2d} don't you?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh{u_0086}{2d} did you hear that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yoko!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh dear. There's that glare again.{NextPage_49}
Are you getting enough calcium{u_0086}{2d}
Takako?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
W-w-what was that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Fighting again? Will you
at least do it somewhere else?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh{u_0086}{2d} all right.
Come on{u_0086}{2d} Takako!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not letting you out
of my sight!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh{u_0086}{2d} I almost forgot. Why don't
you take this? Maybe you'll
become as good as me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You got a {12}Boiled 
Prawn Recipe{17} and a
{12}Blackened Newt Recipe{17}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
T-Thanks. Try not to
fight too much{u_0086}{2d} OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing?
Hurry up and go see Takako!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Speaking of {Location_128_29_128}{_d8}lmon{17}...{NextPage_49}
I remember Yoko stealing one of
my salmon rice balls when we
were in elementary school!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Takako{u_0086}{2d} why do you have to
be so hard-headed?{NextPage_0}
