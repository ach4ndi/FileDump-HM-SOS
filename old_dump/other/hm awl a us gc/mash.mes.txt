{CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi there.
Wandering around, as usual, I see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We should have a drink sometime.
Why don't we get together for a
drink with Takakura at his house?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I forgot...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I may not be able to go drinking
today. Don't you think {CharName_2}'s
gotten more like {CharName_29} recently?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, see you later.
I think I'll be at Takakura's house
around 9 o'clock. Be there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, we're all here.
You done with your work?
{41_2_0}I'm done.
Not quite.
----------x----------
All right then. Let's drink up!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
People sure can change...
Celia never used to give orders to
men before...{NextPage_49}
How about you, {CharName_0}?
How's the husband treatin' you?
{41_2_0}Wonderful as always.
He's changed a lot.
----------x----------
Oh.
You lovebirds...!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...........................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It sure is nice to have a drink with the
friends once in a while. Well, bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just as I thought.
Time changes a man.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I should be going.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See you later.......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK, we'll get started without you.
You can come when your work is done.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All finished?
Let's drink!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll stop by sometime when you're free. We
can have a drink with Old Man Takakura.{NextPage_49}
I could probably only make it at around...
Let's see... Around 9 o'clock. Anyway,
we'll see each other sooner or later.{NextPage_49}
See you later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What were we...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Uh... What were we talking about again?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey {CharName_0}.{32_1_244}
You've gotta pay if you're gonna eat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmph...
What's with you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We don't need newcomers like you
around here, buddy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe you should just run away
with your tail between your legs, loser.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_2}{CharName_2}, don't you have shopping to do?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_5}Hmph...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So that's it, eh?
You came here looking for someone, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That guy stopped her from going.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess nothing is my business, huh?
I can't believe you didn't tell me about
{CharName_2}'s arranged marriage!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you think, {CharName_2}?
Are you going to go out with that guy?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Then just get outta here!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}She wasn't there either...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_7}Why?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}{CharName_2}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}{CharName_2}, come back!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just a minute, you!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard you proposed to another
girl while you were going out with
{CharName_2}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_2}What were you thinking?
I won't allow it!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_5}Oh, do whatever you like...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Fine...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Celia! Don't you have shopping to do?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey!! Open up!
Open up, {CharName_0}!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ouch!!{32_3_32}
What're you doing?
Come on.!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_49}
We finished work a little early, so
we thought we'd go for a drink.
You want to come with us?
{41_2_0}I'd be happy to.
My work isn't finished.
----------x----------
OK, we'll get started without you.
You can come when your work is done.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Farewell...
after all... Rest in peace...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you sing something, {CharName_27}?
For... her.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So did you want to buy something today?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Don't need anything?
Well, come back anytime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK. What do you want?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{13}{29_0}{17}?
You've got {2a_0_3} now.
How many do you want?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Uh-oh. Your rucksack is too full to fit
any {13}{29_0}{17}.
Come back after you've cleaned it out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, you don't have enough money.
Come back when you have enough.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So that's {2a_0_2} of the {13}{29_0}{17}...
That'll be {2a_1_7}G.
Is that OK?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
...Thanks.
Come back anytime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Change your mind?
OK then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you need anything else?
{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Hey, what's up?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey.
Got a sec?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_144}{50_30_0_4}Hmph... Nothing here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh well.
I'll be back later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}Don't mind me.
Just lookin'.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is this all you've got?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How much is the {29_0}?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
Seriously?
That's a good deal. OK, I'll take it.
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK, I'll take it.
Thanks...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmph.
Oh well, never mind...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know what? Never mind.
Sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Who are you? Oh, you came here a while
ago, didn't you? I'm here helping out
with Vesta's farm work.{NextPage_49}
I used to work for a company in the city,
but I had some health problems, so...
I decided to come where the air was clean.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_7}................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_7}................
Just leave me alone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}What do you want?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_5}You want something from me?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi.
It's pretty late, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi.
What're you up to at this hour?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey there.
Nice to see you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi.
What're you up to at this hour?
Well, I guess I shouldn't talk...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you giving that to me?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Cool.
No really. Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}Oh, I see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}You have something good there.
Are you giving it to me?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
That looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got something nice there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}What is that, anyway?
I sure don't need it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_5}I don't want that.
Thanks for offering, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_3}This is Rock's kid, huh?
I guess kids can be pretty...
cute. I guess...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Cute kid, but...
I'm not very good with children...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_3}This is that guitar player's kid, huh?
Looks like you. Cute.
I guess kids aren't so bad...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}.An animal, huh?
I'm not very good with animals.
I think plants are more my speed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
face:(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((0)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1):((((((((((0)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)＋1)>I do think it's cute, but...
I'm not so good with animals.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Hey, nice seeds!
Don't you think?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck growing your
crops.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_3}Did you grow that?
It looks pretty good.{NextPage_49}
Do you want me to give it a taste test?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
Looks pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nice color, nice sheen.
Yep, that's a good one, all right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}Is that from your farm?
Are you giving it to me{40_1_0}
----------x----------
Hmm. It looks fresh.
It should be pretty tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}You could call that “nature's bounty.”{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You could call that “nature's bounty.”{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you use it in your cooking?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}Did you make that?
For me?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}It looks pretty good,
I think.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like spicy food.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}That looks pretty heavy...
What a weird hoe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}That's an unusual hoe.
Where did you get it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}That hoe's seen a lot of use.{NextPage_1}Hey, didn't that used to be at our house?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought Vesta really liked
that hoe...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}That hoe's still pretty new.
You have to break it in...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}That hoe looks like it's got its whole
life ahead of it, if you know what I mean.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}You seem to be using that hoe
a fair amount.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The more you use your tools,
the easier they are to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}That hoe has been used quite a bit!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}So now that it's broken in,
I bet it's pretty easy to use, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}That looks pretty hard to use.
What a weird sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}That's an unusual sickle.
Where'd you get it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}Wow, that sickle looks like it could
shave peach fuzz... That's sharp!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}That's a weird sickle, but
it looks pretty sharp.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}That sickle is still pretty new.
You have to break it in...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}That sickle looks like it has its whole
life ahead of it, if you know what I mean.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}You've used that sickle a fair
amount, I see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The more you use a sickle, the
easier it is to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}You've used that sickle quite a bit!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}It must be nice to use that
in your work, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}Doesn't that watering can
have kind of a... strange shape?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Yep, that's a weird watering
can all right. Weird.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}You haven't been using that
watering can much, have you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}That's still brand new.
What, don't you like farming?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}It looks like you've used that
a fair amount.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Would you mind watering our
fields since you have that with you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}Now that's an old watering can.
Must be very easy to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}You've used that watering can
a lot, I can tell.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}What is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}Oh, a machine for
milking cows, eh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}Clippers, eh?
For shearing sheep?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}...Can't really use those in
fields, though. Can I?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Using tools well to make your
work easier is one of the first
things a farmer has to know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a rare stone or something?
Maybe you could sell it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty stone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What... is that thing?
Do you collect those or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not interested in those.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}A wild plant... Yep...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's a big difference between plants
that grow wild and ones that we spend a
a lot of time nurturing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Hey, a record. Nice.
Is that for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}I love music.
Well, it depends on the song of course.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}What is that?
Hmm. Smells good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that some kind of spice?
That should be good in cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}Hey, did you hear something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}Was that the drum?
Not a bad sound.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}Cool sound.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't need that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, a necklace?
That's pretty weird.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now that's a big firecracker.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you planning for that, anyway?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}What're you gonna do with that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Is that a present for somebody?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Hey, I'm Vesta's brother.
I help out with the farm work.
Did I already tell you this?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_144}{50_30_0_9}I'm helping out with the farm work, but
I used to work at a company in the city.{NextPage_49}
I guess there's no point thinking about
it now, but if I hadn't gotten sick, I'd
probably have gotten promoted...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}I don't really get along well with
most people... Well, I do like Celia.
She's like a sister to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral Town is
really rich.
It's nothing to do with me, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral Town is
really popular.
Not like me, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that {29_0} from Mineral
Town has shipped every crop there is.
That's pretty impressive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer in Mineral Town loves animals.
Not like me, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can you really make money digging holes?
Oh, I mean the farmer from Mineral Town.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral Town is
a master angler. Did you know that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral Town
really loves walking.
She must carry a pedometer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} Farm in Mineral Town
has been going for 50 years.
Do you think you'll last that long?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral Town is
an amazing angler.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral Town
likes everything to be in gold.
That's too flashy for my tastes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral Town
has three cottages.
Maybe she's into real estate.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that there's a blacksmith in
Mineral Town that makes amazing tools.
What kind of tools are they, anyway?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}...That thing you gave me was
really good.
Good job.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}That thing you gave me
wasn't my cup of tea.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}The {29_0} you gave me
wasn't great.
You need to work harder on it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}The {29_0} you gave me
was pretty good.
You're doing pretty well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}The {29_0} you gave me
was totally amazing.
You're better than I thought.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}The {29_0} you gave me
was one of my favorites.
That was tasty. Yep.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}I don't know what kind of milk it was
that you gave me, but it wasn't great.
You need to work on it more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know what kind of milk it was
you gave me, but it wasn't bad.
You're doing OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}I don't know what kind of milk it was
you gave me, but it was pretty good.
You're getting better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}I don't know what kind of milk it was
you gave me, but it was just fantastic!
Thanks!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}...I don't know what kind of milk it was
you gave me, but it seemed kind of
smelly.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}I don't know what kind of milk it was
you gave me, but it was pretty good.
It was a little smelly, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}...I don't know what kind of cheese it was
it was you gave me, but it was
pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that cheese you gave
me yourself, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}I don't know what kind of butter it was
that you gave me, but it was
pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that butter you gave
me yourself, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About that dish you gave me...
{50_30_0_3}It was pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About that fish you gave me...
{50_30_0_3}I'm at a loss for words...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About that wild plant you gave me...
{50_30_0_3}It was pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About that food you gave me...
{50_30_0_3}It wasn't bad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}You're working hard every day, I see.
You're a real farmer now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}You're working really hard on your crops.
You're doing well.
You've got me beat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}I heard you're quite a cook.
...Are you thinking of turning pro?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You seem to be working hard.
It's doing your farm good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you working hard on your crops?
It's not easy, is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you working hard on your cooking?
Do you like it better than farming?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Are you used to farming yet?
{34_1_145}You've still got a ways to go, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Are you used to working in the fields?
{34_1_145}You've still got a ways to go, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}...Have you gotten used to cooking yet?
{34_1_145}You've still got a ways to go, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not very good with people, but...
What do you think of me?
{41_3_1}I like you.
You're kind of gruff.
Um... I don't think of you.
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Really?
It really makes me happy to have someone
understand me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Heh heh.
It's kind of nice to hear someone
say that straight out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Oh. I see.
Definitely not interested, hmm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't think I'm cut out for farm work,
but I wonder what job I'd be good at...{NextPage_49}
Anyway, Vesta would be lost without
me. So I guess I'm stuck with this job for
the moment.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't think I'm cut out for farm work,
but I am interested in crops.
I've been researching hybridization.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hybridization is when you take the genes of
two plants and make a third, new plant.
It can be pretty interesting.{NextPage_49}
For example, if you combined a Tomato and
a Watermelon, you'd get a {26_0_5}
that has both of their genes.{NextPage_49}
Or if you combined a Melon and a
Strawberry, you'd get a {26_0_10}
that has both of their genes.{NextPage_49}
And if you combine the {26_0_5} and the
{26_0_10}, you get something that has
genes from all of those plants.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This lifestyle isn't so bad when you think
about it, but it is a little boring...
I sometimes wonder if this life is for me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Daryl may be researching hybrids too,
but he's such a weird guy and all,
who knows what he's up to.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want to help Vesta by growing crops in
my own way.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
In all of Forget-Me-Not Valley,
this place suits me the best.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel relaxed when I come here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can stay here for as long as I want,
so I like it here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Working in the fields is hard work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How's your farm going?
If you have any questions, ask Vesta.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's comfortable here, so I
like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you come here often?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't you think this is a nice time of
year? It's getting warmer...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Yep, this is a nice time of year.
Especially for me and my health problems.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hot or cold weather isn't very good
for me. {50_30_0_3}But it's pretty mild here all
year 'round, luckily.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I used to be really busy before I
came here...{50_30_0_3} I like it here.
My life is a lot more relaxed now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_144}{50_30_0_9}It's kind of humid...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_144}{50_30_0_9}You're pretty healthy, aren't you?
I sure envy you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Not too hot, not too cold...
{50_30_0_3}This is a good time of year...
Especially for me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is the busiest time for me,
what with the harvest and all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_144}{50_30_0_9}It's kind of cold, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_144}{50_30_0_9}I guess you're free to play now too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you think of our fields?
I was just wondering how they
looked to you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You may be here because you like
farming, but I never thought I'd end
up a farm hand.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you make hybrids, you usually get
crops that resemble the color and shape of
the crops you used. But not always.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}You know, recently I think
my health has been improving a
little bit...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Recently, I...
I mean... Have you been having a lot
of fun lately? Maybe it's just me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}I'll pass for now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's probably not good for my health to be
out walking around on a day like this...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But weather like this is good
for our crops...{NextPage_1}{50_30_0_2}You know you're a funny woman.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Hey, I've gotta be goin'
to bed soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}I'm goin' to bed now.
Could you make yourself scarce?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}I've gotta be goin' out
pretty soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}I've gotta leave
now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_0}W-what?
I wasn't watching Celia
or anything...!{NextPage_49}
Don't just stand there, say something!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Celia, she...{NextPage_49}
I feel like Celia's changed
a little recently.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
She's gotten older, more mature...
She seems more feminine... err, that is...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if she has a boyfriend...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If he's some no-good, I'll beat
some sense into him!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll decide who's good for Celia
and who isn't!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No, that's not true, Celia...{NextPage_49}
Celia...
Avoid you? Why, I...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I...
I'd never do anything like that, would I?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Celia and I have been working together
on the farm for two years.{NextPage_49}
I've come to think of Celia almost
like a member of my family.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's what I've been so worried about.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've been trying to figure out if our
relationship is more like a brother and
sister, or a man and a woman...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm just not sure.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Celia...{32_3_232}
----------x----------
Have you seen Celia?
She went out and hasn't come back.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's true... But if anything did
happen to her, I...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to go look for her.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Celia!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Celia.
Celia...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Celia, are you OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Celia... I've been looking for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You had me really worried!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't disappear like that again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There're ducks in the pond.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder where they came from...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe we should keep 'em.
{41_2_0}Keep them.
Don't keep them.
----------x----------
Cool.
Well, we've gotta give them names, right?
What should we name the male?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's too bad.
I guess we should set them free somewhere.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Input_128}, eh?{32_3_232}
OK, what about the female?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Input_128}? All right.{32_3_232}
We should show them the {Location_43_21_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey {2d}.
Why don't you make food this
good at home?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's go home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_0}......
Not here?{NextPage_49}
Maybe I'll go look.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's gotten pretty late.
{CharName_1}'s still not back...{NextPage_1}I'll go have a look around.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_0}It's pretty late.
{CharName_1} still hasn't
come back...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}{2d},
I'm going to go take a look around.
It's dark. You wait here, {2d}.{NextPage_49}
{50_0_0_9}{32_1_44}Hmm...?{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
Yes, we're both worried...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}{CharName_1}, we were worried about you.
Make sure you come home earlier from
now on.{32_1_44} OK...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I'll put {CharName_1} to bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, it's getting late.
Good night, {CharName_1}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night, {CharName_1}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that the time?
Is {CharName_1} already asleep?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yawn...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning, {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning!
You're up early, {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, it's morning!
You'd better be getting up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, I have to get up early,
so I think I'm going to turn in now.{NextPage_49}
Night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's about time for bed, {CharName_1}.
Go on, get in bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see... Have I told you about the
monsters that eat kids who stay up late?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's better.
Sweet dreams.{NextPage_49}
Good night, {CharName_1}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1},
what do you think?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Between men and women, the one who falls
in love is the loser. You're put on the
offensive. {CharName_1},{32_1_244} you love her?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Then you've got to go after her.{NextPage_49}
That's all you really need to know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{32_1_244}Good luck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's with all the noise?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome home, {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you saying?{NextPage_49}
Your mom's surprised too.{32_5_220}
I'm only thinking of what's best for...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}...{32_3_32}
I don't need that kind of attitude
from you. Ever.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_0}.........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_0}S-so, are you used to the farm yet?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Um...........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}That is... Ah...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_0}Yeah.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_0}Did you have some business with me?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}What's your hobby?
I'm busy. I have to go.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Hm?{NextPage_1}Hobby...{NextPage_1}I don't really have a hobby...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}I guess drinking, maybe?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_0}By the way,
do you like vegetables?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Sure.
No.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Then you should eat a lot of them.{NextPage_1}There are lots of people who don't eat
enough vegetables these days.
{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_0}That's especially true for
people who live alone. Watch out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}If I can do anything to help you with
your vegetables, just let me know.{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}That's kind of you.
No thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}I-I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't say that kind of thing.
It makes me embarrassed...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}But I'm not mad or anything.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_0}I don't know what to say, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_0}Come visit me any time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_7}I-I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_7}I'm sorry.
I guess I was being too pushy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_7}Oh. You don't like them?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_7}Never mind then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_0}Oh... I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_0}You must be busy at the farm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_0}Well, bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, it's you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry.
I was just doing some thinking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About what?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't tell you.{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}I want to hear.
Then I'm going home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}No!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}You'll just make fun of me.{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}No I won't.
Geez, just spit it out, buddy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK...
Just don't tell anybody.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It was yesterday...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Celia.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I had a dream about Celia.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sigh...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't it stupid to worry about a dream?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Not really.
Ha ha ha!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I-I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I feel a little better now.
I really didn't expect you to say
something like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}You're a kind woman, aren't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}You can have this if you like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}I guess it was even stupider of
me to tell you about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}Hey!
What's that supposed to mean?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}I don't have anything to say to you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_7}There's no point in you hearing
about it anyway.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ahh!!{32_1_244}
----------x----------
Yeah.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh...it's you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Celia!{NextPage_1}Are you OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Shall we have a chat?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Sure.
No.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just so you know, I don't do this
with just anyone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But because it's you, I thought
it'd be nice to talk...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
O-Oh, OK...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So how do you like it here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are things going well?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Sure.
Not really.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see.
That's good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Me?{NextPage_1}Oh, I'm getting by.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But when I first came here, I was kind
of a fish out of water.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A fish?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You fish?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I-I'm... going home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_7}I see.
Well, do your best.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_7}Instead of talking with me, maybe
you should be doing your farm work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll go see Celia.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see.
OK then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey.
It's you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_7}I'm sorry.
I'm not in a talkative mood right now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}Can you leave me alone?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}What's wrong?
OK. I am leaving.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Five years ago, I got sick and had to stop
working in the city, so I came here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But even now, five years later,
my sickness hasn't been cured.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The doctors say that if I have the right
attitude, I might get cured, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_7}I bet I'll be this way forever.{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}That's not true.
Maybe so.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}What do you know about it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}You don't know how I feel.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}Just leave me alone!{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}(Shake your head.)
I see. Bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was thinking about the past.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just leave me alone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A blue feather...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you sure?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want to continue work on the farm.
OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think you've done a great job there
alone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now we'll do the work together!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Didn't you show me this before...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No, let's just forget about
that...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning...
Um... It's me, {CharName_30}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry for coming like this.
I've got something I want to talk to
you about today...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's been exactly a year since you first
came here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And uh...
It seems that being around animals helps
my sickness...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So, uh....
I know you've got a dog...
and some animals... So...{NextPage_49}
I wonder if I could live here?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Yes. Let's farm together.
I'm sorry.
----------x----------
T-Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think this'll really help me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...I understand.
Good luck with your life...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
Sorry for coming like this.
But I have something that I want
to tell you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's been exactly a year since you first
came here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A lot has happened in that year...
And...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And before I knew it... I...uh...
Even more than Celia... So...
Will you marry me?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Yes. Let's farm together.
I'm sorry.
----------x----------
T-Thanks!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All right.
I've gotta go tell {CharName_29} and the others.{NextPage_49}
Bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I understand.
Good luck with your life...{NextPage_49}
Bye...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, isn't it nice
to be clean?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Feel all clean?
Your cheeks are all pink now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}{CharName_1}, don't cry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is this...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just a minute.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_29}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_26}Thanks for everything.
It was fun.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_2}, thanks to you too.
Don't go out with any creeps.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Well... {CharName_29}, {CharName_2}...
Goodbye.{NextPage_0}
