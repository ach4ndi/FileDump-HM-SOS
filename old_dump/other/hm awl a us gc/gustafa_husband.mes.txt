{50_20_0_3}{CharName_1},
Mommy's playing with you, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...{NextPage_49}
I thought maybe {CharName_1} should
take over {24_2}Farm.
Why do you think?
{41_2_0}Definitely.
That's for {CharName_1} to decide.
----------x----------
Of course.♪
{CharName_1} was born on a farm, after
all. That kid'll make a great farmer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Well, that's true.
Maybe I was getting ahead of myself...
Growing up healthy is the most important.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, you ready to go night-night? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, there's not much
food left in refrigerator.
Could you put some more in?{NextPage_49}
Good night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome back.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} just went off to dreamland.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
By the way... {CharName_1}'s
been watching a lot of TV lately.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, you think he will be
interested in taking over the farm?{NextPage_49}
{CharName_1} seemed pretty
interested in the farm report...
What do you think?
{41_2_0}I bet you're right!
It's too early to tell.
----------x----------
Yep.
I bet that kid'll be helping you out on
the farm before you know it.{NextPage_49}
Won't that be nice?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_26}I guess you're right. But if we project
enough positive vibes about the farm,
{CharName_1} will probably like farming.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
♪A necklace of♪
♪white flowers...♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
♪A necklace I got♪

----------x----------
{CharName_1}, Mommy'll be back
soon, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, that was great!
You want to sing that for Mommy?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}!
{CharName_1}'s an amazing
singer!{NextPage_49}
That kid learned that song in no time.
I bet {CharName_1} has talent.
{41_2_0}I bet you're right!
It's too early to tell.
----------x----------
That's my kid!{32_3_232}
I'm looking forward to the future...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Hmm....{32_3_232}
{50_26_0_26}I guess you're right.{NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_3}But if that kid can sing that well
with no training, I think we should try
to help out, you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}What're you drawing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}......Mommy???{NextPage_49}
{50_20_0_25}....That's very good...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} drew this.
What do you think it is?
{41_3_0}Flowers.
Me, of course.
Don't know.
----------x----------
Yes. Flowers... But I think it's got a
real aura of talent about it, you know?
{50_26_0_3}I think that kid is gifted...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}....Really?
If you say so, {2d}...{NextPage_1}Woah!
{50_26_0_3}Do you think {CharName_1}
could be some kind of genius?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmmm.
It looks like flowers to me.
But {CharName_1} says it's “Mommy.”{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But depending on how you think about it,
{CharName_1} might be have
real talent.{NextPage_49}
I bet adults just can't appreciate it.
{50_26_0_3}Maybe even a genius...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}What're you doing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}You're working hard.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey {2d},
{CharName_1} seems to be a pretty
good athlete. Don't you think?
{41_2_0}I don't know...
Of course.
----------x----------
I'm sure of it.
That kid loves running and jumping.
That boy will be a sports star...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sure. {CharName_1}'s your kid, after
all. {50_26_0_3}Anyway, we've got to help out!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey {2d},
{CharName_1} sure likes books.{NextPage_49}
That kid's a regular bookworm.
You know, just the other day...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Hey {CharName_1},
you reading a book?{NextPage_49}
What kind of book is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, what kind of book is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}I'm going to go start up the bath.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey {CharName_1},
still reading?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}You like books, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} loves to study, I can tell.
You think that kid's gonna be a scholar?
{41_2_0}I think so.
You're the father...
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}Groovy.
A famous scholar in our family...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}Hahaha. I guess you're right.
I'm probably biased. But I think we have
to be supportive of {CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, there's something I
want to ask you.{NextPage_49}
I want you to do your own thing, and
all but...{NextPage_49}
Have things been going well on the farm?
{CharName_7}'s worried because
you haven't been shipping much.
{41_2_0}I'm sorry. I'll try harder.
Who cares about this dumb old farm!
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Do you really mean that?
{41_2_0}No, I'll try harder.
Sure I do!
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}You're kidding, right?
{41_2_0}I'm kidding.
I'm serious!
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}You're serious?!
Don't you care what happens to the farm?
{41_2_0}Of course I do. I'll try harder.
Not really...
----------x----------
I'm glad that you said that.
I feel a little better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You scared me there...
But I guess I'm OK now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, I don't mind living in a yurt and
never bathing, but I think you probably
need money to live...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}But...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}B-But...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}.......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_7}OK, I caught your vibes.
Do what you like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just like singing.{NextPage_49}
Hey, why don't you sing with me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's simple. You'll learn it in no time.
Just follow my lead.{32_9_196}
Here we go...{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
♪Long ago... By a spring...
Two young girls...

----------x----------
Hey {2d},
I wonder if {CharName_1} could have a
talent for music...{NextPage_49}
Maybe this is just my love for music
talking, but...{32_9_196}{NextPage_49}
What do you think, {2d}?
{41_2_0}I think so too.
I don't think so.
----------x----------
I thought you'd say that.
I hope things work out for
{CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure our kid will be a great
musician...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really...?
Maybe I'm just being biased.{NextPage_49}
But our kid does have a great singing
voice. I think we have to be
supportive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure our kid'll be a great musician.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if {CharName_1}
has any artistic instinct...
Could our kid be an artist?{NextPage_49}
What do you think, {2d}?
{41_2_0}Sure.
It's too early to tell.
----------x----------
If {CharName_21} said so, it's
good enough for me...{NextPage_49}
I wonder what kind of artist....
Maybe a metal sculptor like Cody...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, that's true. It's too early to say.{NextPage_49}
But if our kid has an artistic sense
like {CharName_21} said, then I think
we have to be supportive..{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Woah, you scared me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well of course you can't beat {CharName_13},
he's a lot older than you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}'s a really fast runner.{NextPage_49}
{CharName_11} said so.
Could our kid be an athlete?
{41_2_0}Maybe so.
Don't be silly.
----------x----------
{CharName_1} seems to like sports...
Maybe he's a future sports star!{NextPage_49}
{CharName_13} would make a good
trainer, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe. But I've never seen a kid
{CharName_1}'s age run like that.{NextPage_49}
That kid seems to like sports. I think we
have to encourage that sort of talent.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That professor said he wants
{CharName_1} to be his
assistant...{NextPage_49}
I guess that kid's pretty smart.
{CharName_1}'s got a
real thirst for knowledge, huh?
{41_2_0}Could be.
Our child is just naturally curious.
----------x----------
Yeah.
I bet our kid will be a famous scholar.{NextPage_49}
We've got to help all we can to
encourage this talent.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess so. {CharName_1}'s still a kid.{NextPage_49}
But if {CharName_1}'s interested in
something, We have to try and
be supportive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, I'm a little worried.
Is everything going all right
with the farm?{NextPage_49}
This may be none of my business, but
how are things going, really?
{41_2_0}I'm sorry. I'll try harder.
I don't want to do farm work.
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}You can't mean that.
{41_2_0}Of course not. I'll try harder.
I'm serious!
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}You really mean that?
{41_2_0}No. I'll try harder.
Of course I do!
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}So you're really serious?!
You don't care what happens to the farm?!
{41_2_0}I'm sorry. I'll try harder.
No, not really...
----------x----------
I feel a bit better now that you've
said that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Man, you scared me...
But I feel better now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}That kid is growing up now,
and I'd like to remodel the house.
We're going to be OK, right...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}Wha-?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}B-But...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_7}I understand.
Do whatever you like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Look, I understand what you're saying...{32_3_232}
----------x----------
But can't you listen to what we say
once in a while?{32_3_232}
----------x----------
Man!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What book are you reading?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How about a walk?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why so serious?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Then why don't you just ask
Mom?
I'm sure she'd be happy to show you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, that's true.{32_3_232} I've got it.{NextPage_49}
I'll ask her for you. Then
you can ask her yourself when you
get the chance, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
It's about {CharName_1}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} seems really interested in
your work.{NextPage_49}
So if {CharName_1} and asks you, I'd
like you to take some time for your son.
{41_2_0}Of course.
I'm too busy.
----------x----------
I knew you'd do it.{NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_3}You've got to teach that
kid as much about the farm
as you can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's why {CharName_1} didn't
want to ask you in the first place.{NextPage_49}
All right.
If you're really that busy, why not have
{CharName_1} help you?{52_0_0_0}
{39_48}{31}
That'd work, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
It's about {CharName_1}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think maybe {CharName_1} isn't very
interested in farm work. What do you say?
{41_2_0}Maybe not.
Of course my child's interested!
----------x----------
You think so too?{NextPage_49}
But if {CharName_1} likes something
else, that's fine too. Everyone has to
find their own path in life.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You think so?
If you say so, I guess maybe
it's true, but...{NextPage_49}
But if {CharName_1} likes something
else, that's fine too.{NextPage_49}
Everyone has to find their
own path in life.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How've things been going recently?
The farm, I mean.
{41_2_0}It's going well.
Not great...
----------x----------
Really?{50_26_0_35}
Well, that's good.{NextPage_49}
It's just that {CharName_1}'s getting
bigger and all...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm... What're we gonna do?
{50_26_0_9}{CharName_1}'s getting bigger every
day, too...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Music is nice, but you should help your
mother out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Art is nice, but you should help your
mother out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sports are nice, but you should help your
mother out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Studying is nice, but you should help your
mother out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know you like the farm, but you're
still young. You have to try doing lots
of things while you still can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}Yeah! That was great!
Live music is the best!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, it's getting late. Sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} really takes after
me when in comes to music.{NextPage_49}
Maybe that kid's going turn into
a musician...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry. We were both just
so wrapped up in the music,
we forgot the time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} really takes after
me when in comes to music.{NextPage_49}
Maybe that kid's going turn into
a musician...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I ask you something strange?
{41_2_0}No.
Sure.
----------x----------
Hey, that's a little cold.
Can't I just ask you a little
question?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well...
Do round things ever look square?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}???
Of course not.
----------x----------
You don't understand that either, do you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yeah, that's what I thought.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The thing is, {CharName_1}
asked me that out of the blue...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Say what?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you talking about?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm... I wonder.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So that's what happened.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if our kid might want to be an
artist... I think {CharName_1} is
pretty talented...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No problem...
What should I do?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Gotcha.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ready?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ready... Set... Go!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Go {CharName_1}!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Finished!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_13}'s pretty fast, isn't he?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
{50_26_0_9}{CharName_1} still isn't home.{NextPage_49}
It's so late. Where
could that kid be!
{41_2_0}I'll go look.
{CharName_1} is an adult now.
----------x----------
Well, that's true.
But I'm still worried.
Could you go look?
{41_2_0}Alright, I'll go.
{CharName_1}'ll be back soon.
----------x----------
Great. I'll go look, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_19} seems to like {CharName_1}...
Being interested in {CharName_19}'s research
is fine, but staying out at all hours...{NextPage_49}
I wonder if that kid's thinking of
becoming a scholar...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm. If you say so.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey! {CharName_1}'s back!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where've you been?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, just a second...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_19} seems to like {CharName_1}...
Being interested in {CharName_19}'s research
is fine, but staying out at all hours...{NextPage_49}
I wonder if that kid ever considers
becoming a scholar...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing there by yourself?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why?{NextPage_49}
I don't know the details, but it was
before you were born...
I think it was in the spring.{NextPage_49}
{CharName_7} and your mother came
here.{NextPage_49}
But {CharName_7} had been here before, with
some guy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I only asked {CharName_7} about it once.{NextPage_1}But that person was your mother's father.
That makes him your grandfather.{32_5_220}
I guess.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't really know.{NextPage_49}
I never saw him again and
{CharName_7} won't tell me
any more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
She doesn't seem to want to talk about
it. She just says he's working on the farm
in honor of your grandfather's memory.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?
I'm sure your mother would be happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What're you looking at?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you thinking about something...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's been a long time, hasn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}'s all grown up,
and we've both gotten older...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why, your hair's turned all white
and you're all wrinkled! Heh heh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
{41_2_0}You're wrinkled too.
You're as handsome as ever.
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}Hey...!{32_7_208}
{50_26_0_3}I guess neither of us is young anymore.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_10}Oh? Well, you're
being nice today...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But we still have work to do.
{CharName_7} still works so hard every day...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}... {2d}...
What's wrong?
{2d}! {CharName_0}!!{NextPage_49}
{CharName_1}! Call {CharName_31} here
right away!!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hang in there...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How is she?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So...
How's business?
{41_3_1}Pretty good.
Not bad.
Terrible...
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}That's good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, that's OK.
It's better than nothing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}I see.{32_3_232}
{50_20_0_0}Well, that's OK.
I'm sure somebody'll come along soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If nobody's stopping by, maybe you
should close up shop.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't worry about me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, did you sell out today?
{50_20_0_3}...Good job.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you're all sold out, why not
call it a day?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come on, close up shop.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can just have a look, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't mind me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like the {29_0}, but
there's no point in my buying it from you.
Never mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Am I in the way of your business?
{41_3_1}Of course not.
Not really.....
Yes you are.
----------x----------
Really?
OK, I'll look a little longer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I am, huh?
I'll be moving along soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought so.
Sorry. I'll be moving along soon,
don't worry...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll just look a bit longer.
...Just a little bit more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}...Sigh. I feel kind of blue today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}...Could you just leave me alone?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_102}Morning.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_102}What are you doing out so late?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_102}Hello.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}Hey, that looks good.
Could I eat it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}Really? Thanks.
I'll have it later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}Oh, I see... That's OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
That looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's one of my favorites.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}Really?
Thanks.
I'll add it to my collection.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh...
Are you collecting those things
too, {2d}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think it's nice to collect things like
that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got something nice there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}Oh, I'm sorry. I don't really like
that kind of thing. I know you went
to a lot of trouble, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}Hmmm.
I know I shouldn't be picky, but...
I just can't stand that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just don't like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's no point showing me that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not interested in that. Can't you
show me something more interesting?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}Hi, {CharName_1}.
How're you doing?
{32_1_244}.{32_1_244}.{32_1_244}.{32_1_244}I see. Well, that's good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That kid's cute, just like you,
{2d}. We'll have to sing
some songs together.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey {CharName_1},
you seem to be in a good mood now
that Mommy carrying you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi there, {23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good boy. Hmm? What's that you say?
{32_1_244}{34_0_211}{32_3_232}Yes, I see... And?
{32_1_244}{34_0_211}{34_0_211}{32_3_232}...Well, that's good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{23}'s pretty smart.
I bet he'd learn tricks in no time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love animals.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lookin' good, my feline friend.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How's it going, kitty?
{32_1_244}{34_0_197}{32_3_232}Oh, really?
{32_1_244}{34_0_197}{32_3_232}I see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a handsome cat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Chasing chickens around can be
pretty fun.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Will our chicken lay us any
golden eggs?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Having lots of chickens around
sure makes things lively.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Having lots of chicks around makes
me worried that I'm going to
step on one of them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We've got to make sure that this little
chick grows up big and strong...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Baby chicks' faces aren't bad,
but don't you think chickens' faces
look a little grotesque?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How's it going, Mr. Duck?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you stare at this guy's face for
a while... {32_1_244}.{32_1_244}.{32_1_244}.{50_30_0_3}{32_1_244}You can't help but smile.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ducks are interesting.
They look so comical.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what kind of plant those
seeds will turn into...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's great to plant seeds and harvest
crops. It really makes you feel like
you're a part of nature.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If that's a hybrid seed, it might turn
into something pretty interesting...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that one of our crops?
It turned out well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A luscious crop, full of nature's
goodness...
I sound kind of like a commercial...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's organic, of course.
Right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going to cook me something
nice with that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, that cheese looks good.
Did you make that?
Nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you mind if I take a little
taste of that cheese?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Really?
OK, I'll take some time to
enjoy it later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yeah, I guess not. That's for
selling, after all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They say the milk you use to make cheese
affects how it tastes...
I guess that's just common sense.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If that's cheese from our farm, it
must be good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's from our farm, right?
I bet it'd be good in cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you mind if I taste that
butter?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
They say some kinds of milk are best
for making into butter.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you've got milk and butter, you can
make all kinds of dishes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
An egg laid by a healthy chicken has
a very strong, delicious flavor.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't tell the difference between duck
eggs and chicken eggs just by looking.
You just have to wait until they hatch.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Does {CharName_1} like eggs
pretty well?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that dish,
{2d}?
Could I have some?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
...That looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're quite a cook, {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...That's an unusual hoe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know much about tools, but that
seems to have a mysterious power.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a really worn hoe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe contains the soul of the
person who once carried it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess the more you use a tool, the
more it shapes itself to your hand...
Musical instruments are the same way.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks like a normal hoe.
Is there something wrong with it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know much about tools, but that
hoe doesn't seem to have anything
unusual about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an odd sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}You shouldn't wave that around
too much. It's dangerous.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an unusual sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks pretty sharp, considering
how old it is.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's just a normal sickle... Right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Doesn't seem to be any problem with it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a weird looking watering can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a big watering can, but I guess
you can use it to water lots of crops?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Going to do some watering?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A big watering can is best. You don't
have to keep going back for more water.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks like a normal watering can.
What about it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You use that to milk the cows,
right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like doing it by hand better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an odd device...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks like it would hurt if
you used it on your head...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You use that to shear sheep, right?
Don't try to use it on me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't try to use that on
{CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That might make a pretty
necklace...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I didn't know you could find stones
like that around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?
Did you find that yourself?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks like some kind of fossil.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks pretty strange.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those grow all around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that some kind of seasoning?
It smells good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet you could make some tasty
dishes with that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That aroma stimulates the appetite.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}{50_20_0_3}Nice sound, eh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}{50_20_0_3}I'm glad you like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}{50_20_0_3}Doesn't it make you feel kind
of happy?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?
That's not really my taste.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that some kind of medal?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You collect those things?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an odd necklace.
I wonder if there's a story behind that...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}Groovy.
Thanks.
I'll treasure it always.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see.
I guess it is more your style,
{2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I kind of like it, though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think that's guitar music.
Sheet music usually has five lines
on the staff, but that has six...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You couldn't play that on a piano.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks like a hard piece to play.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks a little difficult for me, too.
I don't usually look at music when
I play...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, that's a big firecracker.
What're you going to do with that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}I'd like to set off a big firecracker
like that, just once...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks kind of like a bomb, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Will it explode if you drop it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Something special about that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All I need is music and nature's beauty.
I happened upon this place on
my travels.{NextPage_49}
And I guess you could say I fell in love.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
One of my ancestors was a bard serving
in the court of a king somewhere. I guess
that's why I'm a traveling musician.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've met a lot of people in my time,
but the people here are the best.
Real free spirits. Yeah...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I was traveling long ago, I
met somebody researching insects.
He was a pretty interesting guy...{NextPage_49}
He traveled all over the world
following different kinds of bugs...
I think his name was Chu...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}That {29_0} you gave me
was really good.
...That's one of my favorites.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}That cheese I tried a while ago
was amazingly good.
That's one of the best I've ever had.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Was that cheese you gave me
goat cheese by any chance?
It was good, but a little smelly...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave me a while ago
was really strong tasting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese I tasted a while ago
was pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}I tried that butter you gave me.
It must be pretty expensive, huh?
The aroma and flavor were just great.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter you gave me was a little
smelly. I bet it was made from goat's
milk, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Remember when I tasted that butter a
while ago? It tasted a little unusual.
That was no ordinary butter.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter you gave me was
pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}That {29_0} I ate was
seasoned just perfectly.
I love that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}That dish you made for me
was amazingly good.
I'd love some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}That fish you caught for me was
tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}That thing you gave me was
delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I didn't think this when I first met you,
but recently you really seem like a
farmer.{NextPage_49}
I guess I never really change, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've been thinking recently...
You're really a very good
cook.{NextPage_49}
You're practically a pro.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Growing crops isn't easy, but you're
really trying hard.
I can tell by looking at your hands.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've gotten better at cooking lately,
haven't you?
You seem to know more recipes now...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to travel around the world
with you someday.
After {CharName_1}'s all grown up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}'s all grown up now, so I'd
like to go with you on a trip somewhere...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess we've been here on the farm
quite a while already... Time flies.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're thinking about the future,
right? So are you looking forward
to something in the future?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
I see... Just don't get depressed
if things don't go exactly like you
planned.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just like me.
I just want to enjoy the present.
The future'll take care of itself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I play the guitar quite a bit, right?
Well, what do you think of my music?
{41_3_1}It's not my style.
It makes me feel good.
I'm not sure.
----------x----------
I see. Yes, I suppose that's right.
Well, why don't you let me hear what
kind of music you like? Maybe a record?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Really? Thanks.
I think that's about the highest
compliment a musician can get...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't have to understand it.
Music isn't something you understand.
It's something you feel.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess it's a little late to ask,
but why did you pick me?
{41_3_1}Oh, I don't know.
Because I love you.
It was some kind of mistake.
----------x----------
You don't...know?
Well, I guess that's OK.{NextPage_49}
I guess the important thing
is that we're together. We don't have
to worry about the reasons.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?
That makes me feel pretty
good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Ha ha ha...
A mistake?
Well, we all make mistakes...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I sometimes go back to my yurt even
now. I really like it.
I love the atmosphere there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's nice that there are always so many
animals around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You shouldn't work too hard.
Take a walk in the forest or go the beach.
This is your only life. Enjoy it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {2d}.
It's good to work hard, but isn't it
nice to relax in a place like this?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Griffin sure plays a mean guitar.
His style is different from mine, though.
Have you heard him play?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}I see. So how was he?
I guess he's not actually that good a
player, but there's something about him...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, you've got to hear him play.
I guess he only does it when he's
in the mood, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good music and good drinks... These are
the best presents a man could get.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}...Having fun?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When {CharName_1} gets bigger, we'll
have to go drinking together.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It can be nice to have fun with lots of
friends, but being alone can be good too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to have a jam session with
Griffin sometime...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I started getting up early after coming to
{24_2}Farm.
It feels pretty good, you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you live on a farm, you have to stick
to a schedule... It can be a bit strange.
But I guess it's good for you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like my yurt, but this kind of
log cabin is nice too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've been all over the place, but
this is the first time I've ever lived
in a real house.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's nice to be able to listen to records.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {2d}...
What's up?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like to stop by here sometimes.
You too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm just here for a bit.
I'll be going home soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wandering around in the woods is nice, but
sometimes I like to talk to people, or
just relax at home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you on a stroll too?
The trees sure are pretty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I walk around looking at the scenery,
I find that all kinds of melodies just
pop into my head.{NextPage_49}
Right now I feel kind of...
{50_20_0_3}♪Lulalalalulaalalaa♪
You know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They used to call spring the “Verdant
Season” because everything's green.
Isn't that nice?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I'll go play my guitar somewhere...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Forget-Me-Not Valley has nice scenery,
but there are so many hills that it
can be kind of tiring.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where are you off to, {2d}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I walk around looking at the scenery,
I find all kinds of melodies just
pop into my head.{NextPage_49}
Right now I feel kind of...
{50_20_0_3}♪Badabum de de bum bum♪
You know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you seen that big red star?
You can only see it at this time of the
year. It should be over the ocean.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the people in this area
used to call Summer the “Pepper Season.”
I guess it's because its so hot...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The best place for playing the guitar
is in the shade of a tree. Sometimes some
other guy's there before me though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you ever write poetry?
This is the perfect time of year for that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I come up with a good poem, I always
feel like singing it. And the melody just
comes naturally... For example...{NextPage_49}
♪The sunlight gently breaks through
the trees, and dapples your sleeping
face...♪{NextPage_49}
You know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the people in this area used
to call fall the “Umber Season.” It's
because the leaves turn red and brown.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you seen that pretty yellow star? You
can only see it at this time of the year.
It should be over the eastern mountains.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When the air is so cold and clear, it
seems like my guitar sounds better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sounds seem to be a lot clearer this
time of year, so I find myself thinking of
all kinds of new melodies.{NextPage_49}
For example...
{50_20_0_3}♪Sha sha scabadeedooda♪
You know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the people in this area
used to call winter the “Indigo Season.”
I guess blue is a cold color, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The stars at night are so pretty this time
of year. Especially the blue one that
appears over the waterfall.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There'd be nothing better than playing my
guitar while looking up at the stars...
But it's a little cold right now...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I cook occasionally, but it can't
compare to your cooking,
{2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you're busy, I can just make
something for myself if you'll put
some food in the fridge.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of food does {CharName_1}
like? I like strong, spicy food
myself...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cooking is a real art form.
You put together all kinds of ingredients
to form a single masterpiece.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Kid's rooms are pretty interesting.
There's all kinds of stuff in them...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what {CharName_1} wants
to be in the future...
I'm looking forward to it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what {CharName_1}
really thinks about me...
Probably that I'm a weird old man...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's funny how kids can get attached
to the strangest things. I know I used to
collect all sorts of stuff...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} seems to be reading some
pretty difficult books...
I guess our kid's all grown up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to show {CharName_1} all
kinds of things. I'm sure one of them
will spark an interest.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess we can't go into the kid's room
without knocking anymore.
They sure grow up fast, don't they?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like to come here sometimes and play
with my instruments.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This may just be a small tent, but
to me the world inside it is bigger
than everything outside.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I'm surrounded by musical
instruments, if I listen very closely,
it's like they're playing by themselves...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A long time ago, I visited some nomads.
They taught me how to make this kind of
tent, so I made one for myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Zzzz... Zzzz...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.......Yawn.......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not sure I'm the “father” type.
I'd rather we were like two good
friends...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if {CharName_1} likes music?
I'd love to play with my kid someday.
Maybe it's just a selfish dream...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't watch much television, but
when I turned it on the other day,
somebody was playing the tabla!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The other day when I turned on the TV,
I heard someone playing the ogritch!
That was a surprise.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Try not to work too hard, now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to help you with the farm work,
but I think I'd just get in the way.
I can help clean sometimes, though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It feels good to touch the earth...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It seems like the closer you get to the
forest, the more fertile the soil is.
Isn't that the case with that field there?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Watching crops develop really makes you
aware of the passage of time. It never
really changes. It just keeps marching on.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like flowers. Some of our crops
have some very pretty ones, you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looking at the grass is pretty relaxing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The grass grows well around here.
I bet we could let the animals graze here
all the time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks.
But I think I'd better
pass for now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's raining...
I love getting wet in the rain.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If it's raining, just let yourself get
soaked. If you don't like getting wet,
just wait for it to stop before going out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't have to water the crops on
days like this, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't mind getting wet?
It feels good, doesn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought I might clean the barn
once in a while...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's not really working, but I thought if
there was something I could do to
contribute, I should do it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Working on a farm isn't easy, is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The air is so clean and fresh here.
The smells of trees and water really
help relax the human body.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The forest is always kind of dark, even
at noon. It's kind of exciting...
Like something could jump out at you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A long time ago, there was a Harvest
Goddess living here.
I wonder if she still is...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you come here often too?
I like it here.
...It's so relaxing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What did you think of that song?
{41_3_1}It's a good song.
...Not great.
You're a good guitar player.
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}You think so? Thanks.
That's one of my favorites.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Well, everybody has different tastes
in music.
Maybe I'll try some different songs later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}Hahaha... I'm just strumming a bit.
But it's nice of you to say so.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Would you like to sing a song with me?
Don't worry about the words. Just sing
along with the melody.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I'm playing the guitar, it'd
be nice if you could sing along with
the songs...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}...Nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
♪Lalalalalalalaaaaa♪
♪Lalalaladedumdedaaa♪{NextPage_0}
