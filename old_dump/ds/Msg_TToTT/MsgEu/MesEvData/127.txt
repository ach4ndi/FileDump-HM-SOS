\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f49\u2136Not bad. It's almost as\u2328cute as a panda!\u2328
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136If it's not a panda, it's\u2328not cute to my mind.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136You're thinking about\u2328getting married? Aren't you\u2328a little young for that?\u232b\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f49\u2136Well, as long as you're\u2328sure it's love, I wish you\u2328the best of luck.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136For me? Nah, I wouldn't\u2328feel right.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136You've already given me\u2328enough today. Thanks,\u2328though.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136What do you think you're\u2328doing with that?
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f49\u2136A birthday present for me?\u2328And lookit that, it's \u206dagate\u206c!\u2328I love agate!\u232bYou're a perceptive\u2328youngster. Thank you!\u2328
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f49\u2136Isn't that pretty, now?\u2328You're a thoughtful one, eh?\u232bI appreciate that.\u2328Thank you very much!
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136For my birthday, eh?\u2328You're a thoughtful one.\u2328\u232b\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f49\u2136Very nice! I thank you.\u2328It's very important to show\u2328respect for your elders.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f49\u2136How did you figure out\u2328what I like?\u2328Thanks!
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136A birthday present, eh?\u2328Seems pretty nice.\u2328I'll take it, and thanks.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136You're a thoughtful one, eh?\u2328I accept your gift.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f4a\u2136You got something against\u2328me, eh? If so, spit it\u2328out!\u232bIf not, why in tarnation did\u2328you get me something like\u2328this on my birthday?
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f4b\u2136What are you giving me this\u2328for? Are you pulling my leg?
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f4a\u2136Confound this thing! I hate\u2328its chirping! It ruins my\u2328concentration!
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a!\u2328Glad you got married?\u232bOnce you're married, you've\u2328got to protect your family\u2328at all costs.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f4b\u2136Hmmm. Will the pandas be\u2328safe? This wind isn't\u2328messing around.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f4b\u2136Will the panda be okay in\u2328all this snow? I hope\u2328it doesn't get buried.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f49\u2136I never met anybody before\u2328that I could talk pandas\u2328with like I can with you.\u232bI look forward to watching\u2328the panda grow with you.\u2328
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f49\u2136Did you think that pandas\u2328only eat bamboo?\u232bThey also eat things like\u2328fruit. Didn't know that,\u2328did ya?
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f49\u2136Newborn pandas are awfully\u2328small.\u232bIt's amazing how big they\u2328grow to be.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f49\u2136Pandas climb trees, but are\u2328no good at climbing down.\u2328It's part of their cuteness.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Pandas love to drink water.\u2328Did you know that?
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136How can pandas be so\u2328unbelievably cute?\u2328Tell me, eh, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136What now?\u2328I'm trying to think!\u2328Talk to me later!
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.

\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Oh, for the festival? What\u2328are you showing that to me\u2328for?
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Anything that's not a panda,\u2328I got nothing to say about\u2328it.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f49\u2136There is just nothing cuter\u2328than a panda.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f4a\u2136Aiiieee!\u2328Quit it!!\u2328That's no panda!
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Not much of a pet.\u2328Why bother showing it to me?
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.

\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f49\u2136What's all this?\u2328Bunch of wrapping, eh?\u2328What's in here...?
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f49\u2136\u232a, you're a girl\u2328with some spunk! I like\u2328that!\u232bYou run your farm the right\u2328way, and I'll help you out\u2328any way I can.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Tell you what, \u232a...\u2328Move to this village, and\u2328you'll see pandas every day!

\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136That panda is so soft and\u2328cuddly. Do you think it'd\u2328let me take a nap with it?
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136There's only one reason I'm\u2328here: this is where\u2328the panda is!
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136There's only one reason I'm\u2328here: this is where\u2328the panda is!
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136This tunnel is very well-\u2328made. Outstanding work!
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136It's nothing like Konohana\u2328around here.\u2328And no pandas!
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Eileen has potential as an\u2328artisan. She'd be\u2328worth teaching
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Guess I'll head home.\u2328It's a snap now that the\u2328tunnel's done.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Now that the tunnel's done,\u2328people from Bluebell will\u2328come see the panda!\u232bThat's tremendous!\u2328Don't you agree, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Look at all the bamboo\u2328around here! Panda chow!
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f49\u2136Ho, \u232a.\u2328Thanks for cheering us on.\u232bKonohana won the Cooking\u2328Festival!
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f4a\u2136Confound it, \u232a!\u2328Your weak cheering cost us\u2328the Cooking Festival!
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136We were opponents in this\u2328year's Cooking Festival.\u2328Next time, let's team up.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f4b\u2136Why'd we lose the Cooking\u2328Festival?\u2328Not enough gumption, eh?
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Eh, no big deal.\u2328Practice harder.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f49\u2136How could the Festival\u2328be fun when there won't be\u2328any pandas there...?
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f49\u2136What were you up to today?\u2328No time to participate in\u2328the festival, eh?
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Unless you put all your\u2328passion into it, you won't\u2328win.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.

\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136I never saw that coming!\u2328You, the winner? Didn't\u2328think you had it in you.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f49\u2136The judge for the Cooking\u2328Festival really knows food.\u2328Winning it is impressive!
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f49\u2136Looking at your dish\u2328made me hungry...!\u2328Cook me something, eh?
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136It's all over.\u2328Good work.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136I wanted to see the festival\u2328with my panda...
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Festivals always get me\u2328pepped up. There's always\u2328something exciting.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f49\u2136Ain't that something!?\u2328Now that's a pro at work!\u2328Good job!

\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Growing crops may look easy,\u2328but it's tough.\u232b\u232a, the hard work\u2328you put in is clear as day!
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Well, I don't mind festivals\u2328like that now and again!\u2328The arts are important!
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136The arts build character!\u2328Not as much as\u2328blacksmithing, though.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136That was pretty amazing,\u2328wasn't it?
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Confound it, I lost!\u2328I'll win it next year!
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136How'd I lose that one?\u2328I wasn't ready enough.\u2328Next time I won't lose.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f4b\u2136I lost to you of all people!\u2328Now that hurts.\u2328I'll train for next time.
\u1f46\u1fc1\u1f48\u2136Ho, \u232a.
