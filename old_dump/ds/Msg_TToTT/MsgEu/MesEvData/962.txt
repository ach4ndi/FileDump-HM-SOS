\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Have you ever heard the\u2328story of this statue?
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Years ago, one of the mayors\u2328designed it himself for the\u2328town.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136Even though this statue is\u2328really cute, that mayor was\u2328actually pretty scary.\u232bLike, if he saw someone\u2328littering, he would chase\u2328after them screaming.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Isn't it weird to think\u2328someone that strict made\u2328this cute statue?
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I guess his love for this\u2328village is what made him\u2328act like that. 
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136You can feel all that love\u2328when you look at the statue.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Everyone who lives here\u2328loves the statue a lot.\u2328It's really special to us.\u232bIt's become a symbol of\u2328the love we all feel for\u2328this village.\u232bHey, \u232a.\u2328Do you like it here?
\u2332 Yeah! I like it a lot!\u2328 Not really...
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136I'm glad you like\u2328our village too.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I can't imagine living\u2328anywhere else.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4d\u2136I'm sure the more you learn\u2328about our village, the more\u2328you'll come to love it.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136It's so late!\u2328The time just flew by!\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136I had so much fun today.\u2328Let's chat again soon.\u2328Later!
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136You do? That's too bad.\u2328Each to his own, I guess.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4b\u2136Sorry. I'm a little tired.\u2328I think I'll head home.\u2328Later...
