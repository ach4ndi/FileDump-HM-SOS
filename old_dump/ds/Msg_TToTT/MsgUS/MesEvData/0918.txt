Maybe we could use the\u2328soothing qualities of music\u2328at the clinic...
\u1f40\u1fae\u1f49\u2135What a bright, cheery song.\u2328It reminds me of spring.\u2328This is so much fun!\u232b\u1f41\u1fbf\u1f49\u2136I love this song.\u2328It's so cheerful.\u232b\u1f40\u1fba\u1f49\u2135I like it too!\u2328It makes me want to go\u2328play outside.
\u1f41\u1fbc\u1f49\u2136Hmm, what a nice song...\u2328It almost feels like it was\u2328written just for me!\u232b\u1f40\u1fb9\u1f49\u2135I like this song too.\u2328It's nice to relax with a\u2328song like this sometimes.\u232b\u1f41\u1fad\u1f49\u2136I agree. Soothing music like\u2328this is the best for plants.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f49\u2136I don't listen to music very\u2328often, but this is nice.\u232b\u1f40\u1fc1\u1f49\u2135I'm used to the sound of\u2328animals, but these\u2328instruments sound real nice.\u232b\u1f41\u1fbe\u1f49\u2136What a nice song that was!\u2328I can't wait to hear more.
\u1f41\u1fbf\u1f48\u2136That's so cool...\u2328I wish I could play...\u232b\u1f40\u1fae\u1f49\u2135Ying, do you want to\u2328learn an instrument with\u2328me?\u232b\u1f40\u1fba\u1f49\u2135I-I want to do it too! Let's\u2328practice together, Ying!

\u1f41\u1fbc\u1f49\u2136Hmm, what a nice song.\u2328All true scholars are also\u2328lovers of music, I think.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb9\u1f49\u2135This is about the only\u2328chance we have to listen to\u2328music together.\u232bSo I'd like to keep\u2328this festival going.\u232b\u1f41\u1fae\u1f49\u2136I hope you do.
