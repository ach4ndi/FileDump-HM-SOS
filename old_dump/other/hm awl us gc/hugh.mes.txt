{50_13_0_4}Sorry I'm busy now.{NextPage_49}
{CharName_16} is always
picking on me. {NextPage_49}
How am I supposed to
keep any face at
all with her? {NextPage_49}
I know!
I need to get
stronger! {NextPage_49}
Then she won't be
able to pick on me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to train
harder and grow
stronger!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You let me win
this time. {NextPage_49}
We'll compete
again some other
time. {NextPage_49}
I look forward
to it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_26}K-kate...
I need to talk
to you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_26}Um...
We've been together
a long time, right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_26}Right.... {NextPage_49}
Y-y-you think we'd
be happy if we ever
got married. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}K-kate... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_7}I never said I
liked you or
anything like that!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_4}No! I said NO! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_7}Dad always cuts my
hair funny, so
{CharName_16} teases me
for it! {NextPage_49}
She calls me
"Onion Head"! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_7}I don't know!
I can't stand it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_7}I hate you, Dad! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I won't lose to
{CharName_16}! {NextPage_49}
{CharName_1}, let's
do it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}Oh!
Wait!
{CharName_16} cheated! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_0}You surprised me!
{50_13_0_25}When did you get
here?
{41_2_0}Just now.
A little before.
----------x----------
Thank goodness.
It's okay then. {NextPage_49}
Oh, nothing,
nothing at all. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_26}W-w-what?
Y-you were? {NextPage_49}
D-did you hear me
talking to myself?
{41_2_0}Not at all...
Ah...Not really.
----------x----------
{50_13_0_2}That's kind of
suspicious...{NextPage_1}Are you sure you
didn't hear anything?
{41_2_0}Really, nothing.
R-r-really, nothing.
----------x----------
{50_13_0_4}I don't believe you!
Are you really really
sure?
{41_2_0}Really really sure.
Something bout {CharName_16}?
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}Ahh...you heard?{NextPage_49}
{50_13_0_26}I-i-it's not like
I like her or...
anything...
{41_2_0}Is that so...
Really?
----------x----------
{50_13_0_4}Yeah that's so!
Duh! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_0}She's picking on me
right now, but I'll
show her someday!{NextPage_49}
{50_13_0_2}Ah!{32_2_188}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_26}But don't tell
{CharName_16} what I just
said, okay?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_26}Mmm... But I can't
say that I don't
care about her...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_4}W-what do you mean?
I don't care about
{CharName_16} at all!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_25}Pant...pant...
That was close...{NextPage_49}
Pant pant pant...
He's pretty fast...
Pant pant...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish someone would
be the starter... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad shouldn't
push himself too
hard... {NextPage_49}
He's all old and
decrepit... {32_3_232}
Ha ha ha... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, mister? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Psst, over here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mister, over
here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey Mister, what
are you doing here? {NextPage_49}
I see Van here all
the time here,
but you...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's nothing
here that I like. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm just taking
a look around. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Not really anything
good here... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I said I was just
looking... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want that
{29_0}.
How much?
{41_3_2}For you? {2a_1_5}G.
{2a_2_5}G.
Not for sale.
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}Oh, really?
Too bad I don't
have any money. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}Oh, really? {NextPage_49}
I guess I can buy
it with what little
allowance I have. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I might be able
to buy something
at that price. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}But...
How can I buy it?
I don't have money. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um... {NextPage_49}
I don't have money
right now, so never
mind about that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll take it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's that much!?
I'm gonna go tell
my Dad. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Never mind then... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How much for the
{29_0}?
{41_3_2}For you? {2a_1_5}G.
{2a_2_5}G.
Not for sale.
----------x----------
I can't buy anything
because I don't have
any money. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's enough for
me... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, Mr. Farmer! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}...Haaa... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}......... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_73}Good morning. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_76}Good morning. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good evening. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing
up so late at
night? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is something wrong? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why are you up
so late at night? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing
at this time of
night? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you come to
play? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_76}Hola... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you like it
here too? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}That's my favorite!
Can I take it?
{41_2_1}Sure.
Not this time.
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}Yeah, thanks Mister. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_75}{50_13_0_10}Heh heh.
Thank you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_2}That's so lame.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, fine. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}Can I have it?
{41_2_1}Okay.
Nope.
----------x----------
That looks yummy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}That looks so good...
So good...
Hey, can I have it?
{41_2_1}Sure you can.
Nope.
----------x----------
That's so good... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}Ick! What the...?
It's yucky... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}Don't bring me
yucky things. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}That looks really
bad... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}Ick, get that away
from me... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}I don't like that
stuff... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}Where did you get
that from...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's run together
when you get bigger. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's no other
boys around here, so
I'll be your friend. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Watch out for Kate.
She's a bully.
Keep that a secret. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hurry up and get
bigger so we can
play together. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It must be nice to
have a dog... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That dog doesn't get
any bigger. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, kitty...
I want to hold him. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cats are just so
cool... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's going on
Mr. Chicken? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_25}Chickens and me
don't mix too
well... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a duck.
They're cuter than
the chickens. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that some
kind of seed? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you grow that,
Mister? {NextPage_49}
You can eat it,
right...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad always says how
fresh crops are good
for your body. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_25}Truthfully?
I don't really like
veggies much. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey mister!
Got milk?
Ha ha!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I never used to like
cheese because it
smelled funny, {NextPage_1}but lately I find
myself suddenly
liking cheese. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Behold the power of
cheese! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mister, did you make
that butter? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that
butter on your
farm? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Butter tastes
yummy...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you warm that
egg, will a chick
come out of it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like fried
eggs... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like omelets... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you walk around
with an egg, you
might break it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can you actually
eat that...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes I see that
when I'm running. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?
It's for cultivating
earth...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've seen stuff
like that in
farm fields before.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's with that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a dirty
tool... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a nice
clean hoe. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's just a
normal hoe. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where are you gonna
go with that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_25}What is that?
It's kind of
scary... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't go spinning
that around. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Using a sickle looks
difficult. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a well used
sickle. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you going
to do with that
watering can? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you want to
have a water fight?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a strange
machine... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I've had my
hair cut by those
before. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It really hurt
my head. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whoa! If you use
that on someone's
head... {NextPage_49}
I don't want to
think of what would
happen... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are big
shears. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going to
cut my hair? {NextPage_49}
It looks like it
will hurt... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not too up
on all this tool
stuff. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That stone isn't
that pretty. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are all sorts
of different color
stones. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you get that
from near the
waterfall...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll take a look
at it, if they're
old coins... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty
flower. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That reminds me of
the discus throw...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's my Dad's
medal isn't it? {NextPage_49}
Why would he
give that away? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad was so proud of
that medal. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's the medal
my Dad always had.
Why would you...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That medal was my
Dad's keepsake... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty
medal. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder why he
let it go... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?
Do you wear it on
your neck? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's pretty...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I train with my
Dad everyday. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I get tired of
always running
everyday. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's important to
train every day for
the best results. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't have any
friends around here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_25}I don't get along
well with Kate from
next door... {NextPage_49}
She always picks
on me... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Kate always picked
on me. {NextPage_49}
Now...
Well we get along
okay, I guess. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everyday I train in
hope that I will
surpass my Dad. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Someday I'll
surpass my Dad
as an athlete. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I used to always run
behind my Dad, but
now there is no one {NextPage_1}running in front of
me... {NextPage_49}
It makes me feel
kind of lonely... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the
farmer in Mineral
Town is rich. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer
in Mineral Town
is a real nice guy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That guy {29_0}
has grown a lot of
vegetables. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the guy in
Mineral Town is
nice to his animals. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer in
Mineral Town is
always mining. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} of
Mineral Town has
caught many fish. {NextPage_49}
I'm sure he's
never caught any
of OUR fish though. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} of
Mineral Town likes
to walk a lot. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer
in Mineral Town
has great luck {NextPage_1}when he goes out
to fish. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} of
Mineral Town has
really bad taste. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's someone in
Mineral Town who owns
3 vacation houses. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey do you know
about the Mystic
Tools? {NextPage_49}
I heard they exist
in Mineral Town. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}The food you gave
me before was
really yucky. {NextPage_49}
I don't want anymore
like that please. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} was
really good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}The {29_0}
tasted really good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk the other
day was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk I had
before looked like
it was good for me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}The milk I had
before tasted yummy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}I really LOVED the
milk I had last time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk I had
before had a strange
taste to it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not big on
cheese but I liked
the one you gave me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave
me before was too
much for me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I couldn't handle
the cheese I got
before. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}The butter I had
last time was very
yummy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The butter I had
before smelled. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The butter I had
before was yummy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The dish I had
before was
yummy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}The fish you caught
and gave me before
was yummy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The fish you caught
and gave me before
was yummy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}The wild plants
you gave me before
were yummy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The wild plant you
gave me before was
yummy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The food I had
last time...
It was good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad said you've
become a great
farmer. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad said you've
become a great
farmer. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad said you're good
at growing crops. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad said you're good
at growing crops. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard you're
good at cooking. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard you're
working hard on
your farm. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They say you're
working hard in
the fields. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard you cook
a lot at home. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looks like you're
getting the hang
of farming. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looks like you're
getting the hang
of field work. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looks like you're
getting the hang
of cooking. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm training with
all my might to
become one of {NextPage_1}the top athletes
when I get older. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_2}Everyday it's just
"run run run". {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lately, I've been
understanding my
old man more. {NextPage_49}
Now I enjoy when
we go out running
together. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess my Dad is
getting old, huh? {NextPage_49}
He's been ditching
jogging lately. {NextPage_49}
Guess he's going to
retire... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My Dad uses those
machines to work-out
everyday. {NextPage_49}
I can't use them
yet, I'm too small. {NextPage_49}
Sometimes my Mom
uses them for her
diet too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My Dad is grooming
me to be a great
athlete, but there {NextPage_1}are other things
that I want to do
as well. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My Mom told me that
my Dad was really
cool when he used to{NextPage_1}be a marathon runner. {NextPage_49}
That's when my Mom
fell in love...
Keep that a secret...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My Mom is still an
announcer, but her
voice is kind of{NextPage_1}annoying sometimes.
Ha ha.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_25}Kate always calls me
a cry-baby but I'm
really not. {NextPage_49}
I think Kate's
lonely so I play
with her. {NextPage_49}
Really. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do children always
have to listen to
their parents?
{41_2_1}Of course.
Not always.
----------x----------
{50_13_0_2}You're just like
my Dad. {NextPage_49}
I feel bad for
your kids, Mister.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you really
think so? {NextPage_49}
I guess you
understand how
I feel. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My Dad was amazing
when he was young. {NextPage_49}
I was surprised when
I looked at his old
running times. {NextPage_49}
I've got a long
way to go still. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess my Dad
and Mom will keep
working for a while.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's run together.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_2}Adults are so
selfish sometime... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if all the
female sports
reporters want to{NextPage_1}marry athletes?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope my parents
are doing well
when I get married. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come play with
me again. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_2}...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I should go
search the town for
a cute girl too... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Won't somebody
introduce me to a
nice bride... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm no crybaby. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad doesn't drink,
but occasionally
I like to come here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Running isn't
everything. {NextPage_49}
There's so much
more fun things
you can do... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel good... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's play a game!
Are you ready? {NextPage_49}
Rock scissors paper!
shoot! {NextPage_49}
{50_13_0_9}Darn!
Aw man, I won't
lose next time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's play a game!
Are you ready? {NextPage_49}
Call it in the air!
Heads or tails! {NextPage_49}
{50_13_0_9}Darn!
Aw man, I won't
lose next time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Want to try lifting
a barbell? {NextPage_49}
{34_1_78}Ha ha ha...
I was kidding. {NextPage_49}
You couldn't lift
it anyway. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's play a game!
Are you ready. {NextPage_49}
Rock scissors paper!
shoot! {NextPage_49}
{50_13_0_9}Darn!
Aw man, I won't
lose next time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's play a game!
Are you ready? {NextPage_49}
Thumb-wrestling
time! {NextPage_1}{50_13_0_9}Darn!
Aw man, I won't
lose next time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My Dad likes to
work out a lot. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's play a game!
Are you ready? {NextPage_49}
Rock scissors paper!
shoot! {NextPage_49}
{50_13_0_9}Darn!
Aw man, I won't
lose next time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's play a game!
Are you ready. {NextPage_49}
Rock scissors paper!
shoot! {NextPage_49}
{50_13_0_9}Darn!
Aw man, I won't
lose next time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}I'm not really very
good at games
I guess... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Make yourself at
home. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
People say that
spirits live in
the north forest. {NextPage_49}
Nobody's ever
seen them
before, though... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The waterfall feels
nice and cool. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's fun to feel
the rushing water
of the waterfall. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When it gets dark,
you can see the
stars above the sea. {NextPage_49}
It's really a very
beautiful sight.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes I see a
huge turtle by
the swamp... {NextPage_49}
I wonder where he
goes when he's not
in the swamp...? {NextPage_49}
He must dive into
the swamp somewhere. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is a great
season for running. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The north words is
strange. {NextPage_49}
There's some weird
white haired thing
in there... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes you can
see strange things
around here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't talk to me
when I'm running. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad may love running
but everyday is just
too much for me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you need
something? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're interfering
with my practice.
Please go away. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My Dad will yell at
you if you interfere
with my practice. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't talk to me
when I'm trying to
practice. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes I get to
eat Grandma Nina's
cooking. {NextPage_49}
It's really
yummy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dr. Hardy is pretty
cool. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes Dr. Hardy
will give me a
check up... {NextPage_49}
I guess it's like
a yearly physical? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you ever had
Grandma Nina's
cooking? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dr. Hardy is a little
scary at first, but
he's a nice guy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's important for
an athlete to watch
his health. {NextPage_49}
That's what
Dr. Hardy told me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's interesting to
see so many weird
things around here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Gustafa is really
good at singing. {NextPage_49}
He only sings
outside though. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Gustafa can play
any instrument
that's here. {NextPage_49}
He's so lucky
to be able to
do that... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes I come
here to relax. {NextPage_49}
I try to stay here
too long though or
I get crazy. {NextPage_49}
{34_1_78}I'm kidding... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's just lots
of instruments
here... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish I could
play instruments... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I suddenly got the
strangest feeling. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}Grandma Nina went
somewhere far away. {NextPage_49}
I wonder if she'll
ever come back. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want to see
Grandma again... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_4}Sorry I'm busy now.{NextPage_49}
{CharName_16} is always
picking on me. {NextPage_49}
How am I supposed to
keep any face at
all with her? {NextPage_49}
I know!
I need to get
stronger! {NextPage_49}
Then she won't be
able to pick on me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_4}Must get stronger...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_4}Sorry, I'm busy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Want to play a game?
Let's have a
drinking race.
{41_2_1}Bring it on.
No thanks.
----------x----------
Rock and Grant race
too, but I'm sure
I'm the best. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK, we'll meet in
the kitchen. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay, well I'll
look forward to
the next time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The food here is
great. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks.
But I can't right
now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mister... {32_3_232}{NextPage_1}Thank you for
everything... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27} do you
have a good song for
times like this? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to bed... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to go
sleep now, so can
you go home? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to leave
soon... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really need to
get out of here... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See ya... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't believe
I lost... {32_2_188}{NextPage_49}
I'll practice more,
and then next time
you're mine! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That was fun. {32_2_188}{NextPage_49}
I won this time,
but I hope we can
race again sometime. {NextPage_0}
