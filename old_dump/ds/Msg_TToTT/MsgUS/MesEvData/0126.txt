\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Man, it was crazy out there\u2328yesterday! Luckily, none of\u2328my deliveries were damaged!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Yo, \u232a!

\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136Um, I'm not a big fan\u2328of this animal...

\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136What's this feather for\u2328again? Isn't it used to\u2328propose to somebody?\u232bAre you getting married to\u2328someone, \u232a? Nice!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136Oh, sorry.\u2328I can't take this.
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Hey, you've already given me\u2328enough gifts today!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Huh?\u2328Is this for me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Awesome! Thanks, \u232a!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Oh, thanks,\u2328\u232a!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136I don't think this is\u2328something you should\u2328give away!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136\u206dCream croquettes\u206c for my\u2328birthday?! You know me\u2328well, \u232a!\u232bThis is awesome! Thanks\u2328a lot!

\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Yo, \u232a!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Yo, \u232a!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Nice! Thanks for giving\u2328me such a great gift\u2328on my birthday!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Oh, for me?\u2328Thanks!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136You remembered it was\u2328my birthday today!\u2328Awesome!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Sweet!\u2328Thanks!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136You trying to make me\u2328depressed on my birthday\u2328or something?
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136Hey, is this some sort of\u2328prank?\u232b\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136No?　Well, just remember\u2328that I don't like these\u2328at all, OK?
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4a\u2136Ugh! What are you doing?!\u2328I hate this! Don't give\u2328it to me ever again!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Yo, \u232a!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Yo, \u232a!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136You look so happy! Man, I'm\u2328so jealous! I should get\u2328married soon, too!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4a\u2136Man, I can't deliver\u2328anything because of the\u2328typhoon! This is weak!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4a\u2136I can't deliver anything\u2328because of the blizzard!\u2328I hope it stops soon!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136I was a little nervous about\u2328living in this town when\u2328I first moved here.\u232b\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136But you've welcomed me with\u2328open arms. I can't thank\u2328you enough for that.
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136I've got a brother. He's\u2328more serious than I am, not\u2328to mention better looking...\u232bI wonder what he's doing\u2328now... I kinda want to see\u2328him...
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136I've actually known Raul for\u2328a long time, but I didn't\u2328know he was living here.\u232bI was so surprised when\u2328I found out!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136When I was younger, I\u2328worked at a caf in my\u2328home town.
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136This job can be really\u2328exhausting sometimes...\u232b\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136But when people thank me for\u2328a delivery, I feel full\u2328of energy again!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136What's up? Takin' a break\u2328from work? That's cool. You\u2328need breaks once in a while.
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Oh, hey! How's it going? My\u2328place is kinda small, but\u2328feel free to have seat!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Yo, \u232a!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4a\u2136What? Is there something\u2328you want to say to me?
\u2332 I'm sorry...\u2328 Never mind...
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136You don't need to be sorry.\u2328Just as long as you\u2328understand...
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Oh? See you later,\u2328then.
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Yo, \u232a!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4a\u2136Man, that was some terrible\u2328weather yesterday,\u2328\u2391!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Yo, \u232a!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Yo, \u232a!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Yo, \u232a!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Yo, \u232a!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Oh, a Harmony Day gift?\u2328For me?!\u232b\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4d\u2136Sweet! Thank you so much!\u232bI'm so happy we're married,\u2328\u2391!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Whoa! This is the best\u2328birthday present ever!\u2328You rock, \u2391!\u232b\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4d\u2136Thank you so much...\u2328I love you, \u2391!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Whoa! This is great!\u2328\u206dCream Croquettes\u206c!\u232b\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4d\u2136You're the most wonderful\u2328wife in the world!\u2328Thank you, \u2391.
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4d\u2136Hey, would you like to go\u2328for a walk with me?
\u2332 I'd love to!\u2328 Uh...
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4a\u2136Sounds like you're not\u2328interested... Well,\u2328never mind, then.
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Yo, \u232a!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4a\u2136I can't believe you would\u2328give this to me on my\u2328birthday...\u232bYou know me better than\u2328that, don't you? I hate\u2328this...
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4a\u2136Hey, don't you know I hate\u2328these?\u232bThink next time before you\u2328give me something like this.
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136Wow, I'm going to be a\u2328father! It still doesn't\u2328feel real to me, though...\u232bI wonder if I'll make a good\u2328dad... What do you think,\u2328\u2391?
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Our baby is going to be born\u2328soon! It's amazing if you\u2328think about it...\u232b\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136This is gonna be awesome!\u2328I can't wait! 
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4a\u2136We're just about to have a\u2328baby now. What should I be\u2328doing?\u232b\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136What? Calm down? I can't!\u2328Our baby is about to be\u2328born!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136I love eating together with\u2328my family. It's way better\u2328than eating alone!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136I think I've changed a lot\u2328since I've been married to\u2328you, \u2391.\u232bIt's pretty neat to see\u2328myself changing like this.\u2328It's an awesome feeling.
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136I used to get lonely at\u2328night, but not since I've\u2328been with you.\u232b\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4d\u2136Thank you, \u2391...
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Being married is great!\u2328It motivates me to work\u2328even harder!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136My job can be strenuous,\u2328but farm work must be\u2328even harder.\u232b\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136I used to know a farmer who\u2328lived in my home town. They\u2328always looked busy.
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Take a break from work\u2328sometimes. You deserve\u2328it!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136It's been a long time since\u2328we had a good conversation,\u2328\u2391...\u232bLet's sit down and talk.
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136It feels kinda gloomy around\u2328here lately. We should\u2328lighten the mood somehow...
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136Can we talk later?\u2328I'm not in the mood\u2328right now...
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4a\u2136What is it? You got\u2328something to say to me?\u2328Then say it!
\u2332 I'm really sorry...\u2328 Why are you angry...?
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136No, I'm sorry... I shouldn't\u2328have yelled at you like\u2328that... I feel terrible...
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136You really don't know what\u2328you did, do you...?
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Is this for the festival?
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Yo, \u232a!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Yo, \u232a!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Hey, that's pretty cute!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Wow, a wild animal! And\u2328it's so friendly to\u2328you! How cute!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136Ack! Get that thing away\u2328from me!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Wow, how'd you manage\u2328to catch that?
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Hey, that outfit looks\u2328pretty good on you!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4d\u2136Hey, do you wanna hang\u2328out with me for a bit,\u2328\u232a?
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Hey, do you have some\u2328time to hang out with\u2328me, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Hey, you wanna go for\u2328a walk together,\u2328\u232a?
\u2332 Sure!\u2328 Sorry, not today...
\u2332 Sure!\u2328 Sorry, not today...
\u2332 Sure!\u2328 Sorry, I'm tired...
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Yo, \u232a!

\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Don't worry about it. Go\u2328ahead and take a rest\u2328if you're tired.

\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Thanks, \u2391! This\u2328is really nice! I'll go\u2328put it in a vase.
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Tomorrow's the Starry Night\u2328Festival. Would you like to\u2328come with me\u270a...\u270a?
\u2332 Of course!\u2328 Sorry, I can't...
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Awesome! I wasn't sure\u2328if you'd want to come\u2328with me.\u232bSee you tomorrow, then!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136It's OK. I understand.\u2328Don't worry about it.\u2328Maybe next time, right?
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Man, I'm so excited about\u2328tomorrow!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Hey, what's inside?\u2328Can I open it?
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136For some reason, I feel\u2328really happy when I talk\u2328to you, \u232a.\u232bI'm really glad I met you.
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Yo, \u232a!

\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Yo, \u232a!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Man, there's so many\u2328deliveries! Well, it keeps\u2328me busy, that's for sure!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136Man, climbing up and down\u2328this mountain sure takes\u2328a lot out of me...
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136It feels so rewarding to\u2328deliver something someone\u2328is eagerly waiting for.
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Making deliveries has become\u2328so much easier ever since\u2328this tunnel reopened!\u232bwork of everyone who helped\u2328reopen it.
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136I'm just here to deliver\u2328something.\u232b\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136I'm kinda in a hurry at\u2328the moment, so talk\u2328to you later!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136It's been so long since I've\u2328had a break. I'm just gonna\u2328kick back and relax!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136I'm off to work now. I'll be\u2328home as soon as I can!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136I'm home! Man, running\u2328around delivering things is\u2328so tiring! I'm ready to eat!
\u1f46\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Oh, hey, \u2391! I'm in\u2328the middle of a delivery\u2328right now.\u232bI'll catch up with you\u2328later. Now, where was\u2328I going again...?
