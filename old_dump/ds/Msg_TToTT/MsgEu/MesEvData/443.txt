\u1f41\u2013\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136\u2014Ah, there you are.
\u1f40\u1fab\u1f48\u2135What is it, Cam?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I stocked those flowers\u2328you said you wanted the\u2328other day.\u232bI just wanted to let you\u2328know.\u232b\u1f40\u1fab\u1f49\u2135Wow, you already bought them\u2328for me? That's great!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136Well... I mean, I'm not\u2328giving them to you for\u2328free or anything...
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Anyway, they're in the shop,\u2328so pick them up whenever you\u2328want.\u232b\u1f40\u1fab\u1f49\u2135Sure thing!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Also...
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136Um, never mind...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Anyway, your dad will worry\u2328if you stay out too late.\u232b\u1f40\u1fab\u1f49\u2135Oh, it's OK. It's not like\u2328the house is far from here\u2328or anything.
\u1f40\u1fab\u1f4d\u2135My dad still worries about\u2328me, though... He just gets\u2328lonely, I think...
