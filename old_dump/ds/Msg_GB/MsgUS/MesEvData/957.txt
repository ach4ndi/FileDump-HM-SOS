\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328\u224dOh, these are\u2328my dad's books.\u232bHe left me\u2328his library.
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328Dirk doesn't read\u2328too often,\u232bso I read them all,\u2328and tell Dirk what\u2328they're about.
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328I'm his older brother, but\u2328I also have to raise him.\u232bI'm all he's got,\u2328since our parents\u2328are gone...
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f4b\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328\u21d5We...We should talk about\u2328something else, I guess.
\u1f41\u1fa4\u1f48\u2332 Yes, a new subject.\u2328 That must be hard on you.
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328Yes... Let me tell\u2328you about this book.

\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328Dirk had even less time\u2328with our parents than I did.\u232bThat's why I want to make\u2328sure that he grows\u2328up right.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f49\u2135\u21d0We're all the family\u2328we've got!
