What's all the fuss?{NextPage_49}
Oh, {CharName_2}! What are
you still doing here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You go on with your
shopping, {CharName_2}.{NextPage_49}
I can't believe
grown men are
acting like this. {NextPage_49}
I'm going to have a
word with them.
{CharName_2}, you go on. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay! Now it looks
like time for a
little talk!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_5}{CharName_30}, this has
nothing to do with
you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_5}I would have told
you if I thought you
would approve.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_5}Just stop it, {CharName_30}.
How will it make
{CharName_2} feel if you{NextPage_49}
keep acting like
this?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_25}Well, if it isn't
{CharName_0}!
{50_29_0_0}Come here now.
{41_2_0}Didn't hear anything.
I'm going home.
----------x----------
{50_29_0_10}Good news, {CharName_0}.
{CharName_2} met someone
nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_25}That's why {CharName_30}
is acting upset. He
can be so stubborn!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_10}So, what is
your honest feelings,
{CharName_2}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_9}What's wrong?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_9}Didn't you have
something to do?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_7}Oh, no!
This is horrible!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_7}Oh, {CharName_0}...{NextPage_49}
What can I do...?
{CharName_2} is gone..{NextPage_49}
{50_29_0_9}What could she
have been thinking?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_7}Oh, {CharName_0}...
{CharName_2}'s gone...{NextPage_49}
Did she say
any thing to you?{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_9}What could
have upset her so
much...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_9}I have to go
looking for her!
{CharName_30}, stay here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_7}Why...?
What if she came
while we're gone?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_7}Please look for
{CharName_2}! She's like a
daughter to me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_25}That's why {CharName_30}
is upset. {NextPage_49}
{50_29_0_9}I'm sorry to
inconvenience you
like this, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please look after
{CharName_2}. She's like a
daughter to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everybody at
{Location_43_30_23}
is waiting for you.{NextPage_49}
Now go and tell
everyone you got
married!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_25}You silly.
Don't say things
like that.{NextPage_49}
We live so close,
you know?
Off you go now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_2}Don't say something
like that!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_2}{CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_2}If something like
that happens, I won't
forgive you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_2}{CharName_2}, come here.
This is all about
you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_2}What a surprise...
You can be so
obtuse sometimes!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_9}She turned down
the marriage!{NextPage_49}
And I thought they
were a good match!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_7}You have something
to do with it.{NextPage_49}
{50_29_0_5}Do you know why
she turned him down?{NextPage_49}
It's because of you,
{CharName_0}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_7}Huh! Why didn't
I notice when you are
right there...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_25}I just want
you to be happy,
{CharName_2}. That's all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm so glad for you,
{CharName_2}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_3}It's beautiful,
isn't it? {NextPage_49}
{50_29_0_0}Receiving a
Blue Feather was your
dream, wasn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_0}We're going home
now, but I'll look
forward to seeing{NextPage_1}you later. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_7}She turned down
the marriage!{NextPage_49}
And I thought they
were a good match!{NextPage_49}
{50_29_0_5}Do you know why
she turned him down?{NextPage_49}
You proposed to
{CharName_2} once, didn't
you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_5}You turned down my
{CharName_2} before.{NextPage_49}
I can't believe you
turn down a girl
that nice!{NextPage_49}
Do you really want
to let her get away?
{41_2_0}Propose.
Stay single.
----------x----------
{50_29_0_25}Just take it.
You love each other,
Isn't that enough? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_7}......{NextPage_49}
So you don't want to
get married after
all, do you...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_7}She turned down
the marriage!{NextPage_49}
And I thought they
were a good match!{NextPage_1}{50_29_0_5}Do you know why
she turned him down?{NextPage_49}
It's because of you,
{CharName_0}!{NextPage_49}
{50_29_0_25}She always
regretted turning
you down.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_25}It's just
as you said! {NextPage_49}
{50_29_0_10}I can see why you
were so surprised the
first time! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_7}She turned down
the marriage!{NextPage_49}
And I thought they
were a good match!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_9}You like {CharName_2},
don't you, {CharName_0}?{NextPage_49}
I know you proposed
to her!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_25}I just want you
to be happy, {CharName_2}.
That's all.{NextPage_49}
{50_29_0_10}{CharName_0} is nice.
He's kind and a
hard worker.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_25}I just want you
to be happy, {CharName_2}.
That's all.{NextPage_49}
{50_29_0_10}I like {CharName_0}.
He's kind and a hard
worker...{NextPage_49}
You think so too,
don't you {CharName_2}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_10}And {CharName_0} likes
you too, {CharName_2}.{NextPage_49}
{50_29_0_9}You're getting
older too, you know.{NextPage_49}
Aren't you ready to
settle down?
{41_2_0}I am.
Not yet.
----------x----------
{50_29_0_3}In that case...!
{50_29_0_5}Just what do you
think of {CharName_2}?{NextPage_49}
Besides, I'll get to
see {CharName_2} more if she
marries someone from{NextPage_1}{Location_43_30_23} than
from {Location_43_31_23}.{NextPage_49}
{50_29_0_3}Why didn't I
think of that before?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_25}{CharName_0} likes
you too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_7}That's too bad.
I would have liked
{CharName_0} as a son!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_25}What are you
talking about?
That's natural! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_7}What are you
talking about...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_141}Hey, there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today is the yearly
Harvest Festival. {32_2_188}
Help us out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We made this with
vegetables from our
field. Eat up!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't say such silly
things! Do you want
to go without dinner?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh yeah...{NextPage_49}
OK everyone, let's
eat up!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did everyone have
fun?{32_2_188}
Come again next year!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_141}Hi there.
How is the farm
going?{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
That's good to hear.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh yeah, I just
remembered.{NextPage_49}
I found this when
I was cleaning up
the other day...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My grandfather used
to use it, I think.{NextPage_49}
I can't use such a
funny-looking hoe.
Do you want it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't have to
thank me.{NextPage_49}
Wouldn't get much
use around here,
anyway.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've got to finish
my work, but I'll
see you later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now don't forget to
pay close attention,
and...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_141}Ah, good timing. {NextPage_49}
I was just telling
your son about
raising crops.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Right...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Would you mind me
talking to him some
more?
{41_2_0}Go ahead.
I don't think so.
----------x----------
Let's talk while
we take a walk in
the fields...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks like your
son is interested
in farming!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's too bad...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looks like your pop
needs you.
Talk to you later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks like your
son is interested
in farming.{NextPage_49}
What a great kid.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't believe the
tragedy! {32_3_232}
You went too soon... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sing something to
ease his spirit,
{CharName_27}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You want to buy
anything today? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
No...?
Well, come back
any time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Great. What'll it
be?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you want the
{13}{29_0}{17}?
You already have {2a_0_3}.{NextPage_49}
How many do you want
today?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry, your rucksack
is full for the
{13}{29_0}{17}.{NextPage_49}
Come back after you
drop off some stuff.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry, but you don't
have enough money.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2a_0_2} unit(s) of the
{13}{29_0}{17}
will be {2a_1_7}G. {NextPage_49}
Are you sure? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_10}Thanks a lot!
Come any time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thought better of it,
did you? Come back
anytime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Excuse me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um...Sorry, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of store
doesn't have any-
thing to sell!?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you don't have
anything, that's
too bad... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Aren't you selling
anything?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just browsing,
thanks. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nothing so great
here...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just looking, just
looking...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like that
{29_0}.
How much is it?
{41_3_2}{2a_1_5}G for you.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
Not for sale.
----------x----------
{50_29_0_10}Really?
That's so cheap!
I'll take it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That much, eh...?
Oh well, I'll take
it, I guess.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_9}Really?
That's too bad...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like that
{29_0}.
How much is it?
{41_3_2}{2a_1_5}G for you.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
Not for sale.
----------x----------
I'll jus keep
looking if that's
okay with you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, how is life
on the farm?{NextPage_49}
Just let me know if
you need any seeds.{NextPage_49}
You can buy them
from anyone here.{NextPage_49}
Just don't sell what
you grow in town,
because we don't{NextPage_1}need the
competition! {NextPage_49}
{50_29_0_3}Ha ha ha! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_2}I'm not in a
very good mood
right now...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looking at you
makes me feel better
though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_2}I'm just so
frustrated right now!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_9}I'm just tired
today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_141}Good morning,
sonny.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_141}How are you feeling,
guy?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_141}Good evening.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_141}You're working late,
I see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_141}What brings you here
so late?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_141}Welcome, sir.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_141}You're staying up
late, I see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's my favorite
food! Can I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_10}Really?
Thanks!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's too bad...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Is it good?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got something
tasty! Can I have
some...? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
Mmmm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry, but I don't
like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_9}Sorry, I just
don't like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What IS that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not interested.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He is such a cutie!
He takes after {CharName_2},
don't you think?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_10}That's a good
baby...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He is so cute! He
looks just like
Muffy.{NextPage_49}
...And you, too,
of course...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He is so cute!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He is so cute! He
looks just like Nami.{NextPage_49}
...And you, too,
of course.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute doggie.
{50_29_0_9}...But, uh...I don't
like dogs.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_9}...Don't bite me,
alright?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_25}Please don't bite
me, doggie...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute cat.
Looks smart.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You like me, don't
you? Purring up a
storm!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute cat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You should keep your
chickens outside as
much as you can.{NextPage_49}
They'll lay better
eggs that way.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute chick!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take good care of
it, now!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Will you give me
some eggs? It would
really help out...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing
with a duck!?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute duck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ducks have such
interesting faces.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if duck
eggs taste any good?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You have to plant
the right seeds for
the season, you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Some crops will only
grow in good soil,
so you have to choose{NextPage_1}soil carefully for
certain crops. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let me know when
this flowers.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let me know if you
need any other seeds.{NextPage_49}
I'll share if we
have them. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you grow that?
I wonder how it
tastes...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I have some
of that crop?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_10}Thanks!
I can't wait to taste
it later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I understand how you
feel. Let me know
if you reconsider. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If your crops turn
out better than ours,
then I won't sell{NextPage_1}you any more seeds.{NextPage_49}
...{50_29_0_3}Ha ha, just
kidding! {50_29_0_0}That
was a joke.{NextPage_49}
Good luck, now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your crops will turn
out better if you
give them fertilizer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're doing a good
job...!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is this milk from
your farm?
It looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're going to ship
that to town, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that
cheese? Sure looks
delicious...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I have it? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
Everybody's cheese
tastes different,
you see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can tell good
cheese by the color.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that
butter? It sure
smells good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are different
kinds of butter, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The scent is very
important.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did your chicken
lay this egg
It sure looks fresh.{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
Can I have that?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
I've heard that there
are golden eggs.
Do you believe that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If one of your
chickens ever lays
a golden egg, {NextPage_1}please show me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you catch that
fish, sonny?
Way to go!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be careful, because
some fish taste good,
but some are awful!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think Tim loves
fish.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you gather those
wild plants? They're great{NextPage_49}
for soup or tempura.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This area has some
great wild plants. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You should be
careful of mushrooms
in the forest.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that,
sonny?
Looks great...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_10}That looks
scrumptious...!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like men who can
cook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a strange hoe!
Where did you get it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an unusual hoe.
Can you use it...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet that hoe would
be good once you got
used to it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that the hoe
I gave you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you like it? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
I'm glad. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It really is a good
hoe. Too bad you
don't like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's dirty from years
of use, but it's
easy to use, I think.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It really is dirty,
isn't it?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe still looks
new. You've got to
break it in!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got to use
new hoes a lot to
break them in.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Go on and till
the soil with it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that the hoe
you're using?
Looks pretty average.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you use it more,
I bet it'll get
easier to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looks like you've
been using your hoe
a bit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that your hoe,
sonny? {NextPage_49}
Looks like you've
been getting some
good use out of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks pretty well
worn in.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm impressed with
how well you've
worn that hoe in.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a strange sickle
that is. Looks kind
of hard to use...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an odd sickle!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing
swinging your sickle
about here? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a nice sickle.
Seems kind of odd,
though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an odd sickle!
Sure does look
sharp, though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see your sickle is
still new. You've got
to break it in more!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That sickle still
looks pretty new.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that your sickle?{NextPage_49}
Use it more, and
it'll get easier to
use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's dangerous to
wander around
holding that thing!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that sickle yours?
Looks pretty well
worn in!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks like a
great sickle!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that your watering
can? It sure is funny
looking!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a funny looking
watering can!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks hard to
use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a funny looking
watering can. Use it
every day, now!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The more you use it,
the better it will
get, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It won't do you any
good to water here!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That watering can'll
get easier to use if
you use it more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing
watering around here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you're going to
wander around with
your watering can,{NextPage_1}won't you water our
field?
{50_29_0_3}Ha ha ha!{NextPage_49}
{50_29_0_0}Just kidding.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks like a
great watering can!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a nice watering
can that is!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is a machine for
milking cows, right?{NextPage_49}
I saw one in town
once.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you going
to do with that
contraption?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You want to try
milking ME?
{50_29_0_3}Ha ha ha!{NextPage_49}
{50_29_0_0}Just you try it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet you save lots
of time milking
with that!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You use that
everyday?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those wool clippers
remind me of what
we used to use...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you using them
to cut your hair
too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Would you do me a
favor and cut
{CharName_30}'s hair?{NextPage_49}
{50_29_0_3}Ha ha ha... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you use those to
shear your sheep?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet those wool
clippers make
shearing pretty easy!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those wool clippers
are huge!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a pretty stone!
Are you giving it to
somebody?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Is it for me? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
What a beautiful
stone that is!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, what is that?
It sure is
funny-looking... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What could that be?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a record?
How did you find it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard a record
once, many
years ago...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you get that
from {CharName_25}?{NextPage_49}
I bet it'll make
things taste great.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That spice looks
pretty hot to me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_66}{32_5_220}{50_29_0_9}......???{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wasn't that Wally's
medal...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He won it in some
tournament and was
so proud of it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I doubt it'll
do you any good,
though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take good care of
it, now!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an interesting
design that necklace
is!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a pretty
necklace!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_25}I'd love to
take it, but it won't
fit my neck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you
have there...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are those fireworks?
I bet that old man
made them...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are some pretty
big fireworks,
though!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where could you
set those off...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you going
to do with them?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why are you showing
that thing to me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We ship almost all
of our crops to
town.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We used to live
closer to town, but
moved here because{NextPage_1}there's so much
more space.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My brother {CharName_30}
can be strange at
times, but he{NextPage_1}does help out here
on the farm...
a little bit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard a rumor that
the farmer in
Mineral Town is{NextPage_1}fabulously rich.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They say the farmer
in Mineral Town is
very popular. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear that
{29_0} in
Mineral Town{NextPage_1}made every kind
of crop there is.
Can you believe it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The animals at
{29_0} Farm must
be happy to have{NextPage_1}such a good farmer
look after them!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear the farmer in
Mineral Town spends
all his days digging!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear the farmer in
Mineral Town is an
expert fisherman.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear the farmer in
Mineral Town walks
everywhere.{NextPage_49}
His pedometer must
be sky high by now!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} farm
in Mineral Town has
been going for{NextPage_1}50 years! What an
accomplishment! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear the farmer in
Mineral Town has been
at it more than 50{NextPage_1}years! I wonder if
he'll last to 100...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear the farmer in
Mineral Town ignores
his duties and{NextPage_1}spends all his time
fishing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear the farmer in
Mineral Town has
horrible taste.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear the farmer in
Mineral Town has 3
cottages!{NextPage_49}
Seems kind of
excessive to me,
but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear there's a
blacksmith in Mineral
Town who makes {NextPage_1}great tools!
I wish we had the
same here...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_10}Thanks for the
treat the other day.
It was delicious!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What you gave me
the other day didn't
taste very good.{NextPage_49}
Can't you do any
better than that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0}
you gave me the other
day wasn't very good.{NextPage_49}
Needs more
fertilizer, I think.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0}
you gave me the other
day was pretty good.{NextPage_49}
Just a little more
fertilizer, and it'll
be perfect, I think.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0}
you gave me the other
day was superb!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_10}The {29_0}
you gave me the other
day was so yummy!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The cheese you gave
me the other day was
aged perfectly.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The cheese you gave
me the other day was
goat cheese, right?{NextPage_49}
It was a little
stinky...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_10}The cheese you gave
me the other day was
pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_10}The butter you gave
me the other day
was just great.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The goat butter you
gave me the other day
was a little stinky.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_10}The butter you gave
me the other day
was pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_10}I loved the
flavor of the
{29_0}{NextPage_1}you gave me the
other day. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_10}Thanks for the
delicious treat the
other day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_10}The fish you
gave me the other
day was perfect!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_10}The fish you
gave me the other
day was delicious!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_10}The wild plants
you gave me the other
day tasted great.{NextPage_49}
I'd love some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_10}The wild plants
you gave me the other
day were delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The food you gave me
the other day was
just so-so.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're getting better
and better at
farm work.{NextPage_49}
{50_29_0_10}You're turning
into quite the
farmer, man!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Soon I'm going to be
asking YOU about
raising crops!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everyone says you're
such a great cook,
sonny.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think the farm life
suits you, sonny.
Good going.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Raising crops isn't
easy, but you're
working hard at it.{NextPage_49}
I can tell by
looking at your
hands...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looks like you've
been getting more
used to farm work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How do you like
working in the field?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you gotten the
hang of cooking yet?
Let me try something.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Our seeds are famous.
If you use them, your
crops should {NextPage_1}turn out well too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You have to know the
right season for each
kind of seed. {NextPage_49}
Shall I teach you? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
Here goes, then.
pay attention. {NextPage_49}
{13}Tomatos{17} are
Spring to Fall. {NextPage_49}
{13}Watermelon{17} are
Spring to Summer. {NextPage_49}
{13}Melons{17} are
Summer to Fall. {NextPage_49}
{13}Strawberries{17} are
Fall to Spring. {NextPage_49}
{13}Turnips{17} are
Summer to Winter. {NextPage_49}
{13}Potatoes{17} are
Winter to Spring. {NextPage_49}
{13}Carrots{17} are
Fall to Winter. {NextPage_49}
{13}Sweet Potatoes{17} are
Fall only. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you already know,
that's good too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
To raise good crops,
you need fertilizer
and lots of patience.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Crops might wilt if
you don't water them,
if you plant in the {NextPage_1}wrong season, or
if there is a tree
too close. {NextPage_49}
Some crops wilt
naturally after they
bloom, though. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Seeds from good crops
this year will lead
to good crops next.{NextPage_49}
If you add
fertilizer, they'll
turn out even better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be careful to avoid
crops when planting
trees
they'll wilt. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Look at the soil
conditions before you
water. {NextPage_49}
If the soil is dry,
then water. Twice a
day is a good guess.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
TV is a good place to
learn about farming. {NextPage_49}
On mornings and
afternoons of even
numbered days is a {NextPage_1}farming program. {NextPage_49}
On odd numbered days,
there's a program
about dairy farming. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you come to see
{CharName_2}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_2}'s been in such
good spirits ever
since you came! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You came to farm,
right? I think you
ought to learn about {NextPage_1}raising crops, too! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's good soil in
this valley - perfect
for raising crops! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you know you can
even make hybrid
crops? {NextPage_49}
You can mix tomatoes
and potatoes, for
instance. {NextPage_49}
Or, you can mix
different kinds of
trees. {NextPage_49}
You can even mix
two hybrids together!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_30} doesn't like
farm work, but he
does know a lot {NextPage_49}
about breeding crops.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Tomatoes and water-
melons are best for
this time of year. {NextPage_49}
You could just barely
get by with straw-
berries and potatoes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You could even make a
hybrid between a{NextPage_1}{26_0_42} and
a {26_0_9}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is our busiest
time of year. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Tomatoes, melons, and
turnips are best for
this time of year. {NextPage_49}
You could just barely
get by with
strawberries. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You could even make a
hybrid between a{NextPage_1}{26_0_7} and
a {26_0_8}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's hot now, so all
you have to do is
water them and your {NextPage_1}crops will grow. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Strawberries,
turnips, carrots, and
sweet potatoes are {NextPage_1}best right now. {NextPage_49}
You could just barely
get by with tomatoes
and melons. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You could even make a
hybrid between a{NextPage_1}{26_0_17} and
a {26_0_16}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is the
harvesting time, so
we're very busy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Strawberries and
potatoes are best for
this time of year. {NextPage_49}
You could just barely
get by turnips and
carrots. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You could even make a
hybrid between a
{26_0_14} and a {26_0_41}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Snow doesn't stick
around here, which is
good for the crops. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All our vegetables
are organic, so
they're good for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Natural vegetables
are good for you and
taste great too! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Look at the soil
conditions before you
water. {NextPage_49}
If the soil is dry,
then water. Twice a
day is a good guess. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bring our
vegetables here
sometimes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Our vegetables are
very healthy, so I'd
like Galen and Nina {NextPage_1}to eat them too! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Our vegetables are
very healthy, so I'd
like Dr. Hardy {NextPage_1}to eat them too! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ruby's a great cook.
We're thinking of
healthy cuisine she {NextPage_1}could make with
my vegetables. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If we come up with a
diet menu, we're
going to try it on {NextPage_1}Van. I'm not sure if
it would do any
good, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_9}When I went to the
graveyard at night,
there was something {NextPage_1}glowing strangely! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It turned out to be
just Dr. Hardy's eye!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_7}I hear there's
a mysterious red
light that appears {NextPage_1}in the night...
How creepy! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dr. Hardy's going to
the graveyard in the
dead of night!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_4}You can't believe
how mad at you
I am right now! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_7}I don't want to
hear any excuses! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_3}I'm so glad you're
marrying my {CharName_2}.
I can always visit{NextPage_1}you guys, you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_10}{CharName_2} has been
so glad since then! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_10}Oh, sonny!
You gave {CharName_2}
a {13}Blue Feather{17}?! {NextPage_49}
I'm almost jealous
myself!... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_29_0_1}You treat my {CharName_2}
well now, you hear? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry, but...
...Not right now,
thanks. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time for me
to go to bed, now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to sleep,
so you have to leave
now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night, now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think it's time for
me to hit the sack...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've got to leave
now, so you do
too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Bye now... {NextPage_0}
