Please enter a name for your\u2328cow.
Please enter a name for your\u2328chicken.
\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136You'd like to name your\u2328chicken \u206d\u1001\u206c?
\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136Great! They're both\u2328fantastic names!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136Well then, I'll let Jessica\u2328explain how to take care of\u2328your animals to you.
\u1f40\u1fb2\u1f48\u2135So, \u232a...\u232bI'm going to explain how\u2328to take care of your new\u2328animals. Are you ready?
\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136This is the \u206dbarn\u206c.\u232bIt's where you keep your\u2328cows and sheep.
\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136Well? What do you think?\u2328Isn't it magnificent?
\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136I'll let you explain all\u2328about how to raise these\u2328animals, then!
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136First, let me explain how\u2328to put your cow out to\u2328graze...\u232bIf you stand next to your\u2328cow and push it, it'll move\u2328in the direction you push.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136Here's where you take them\u2328when you want them to\u2328graze...
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136...This area right here.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136You don't have to give them\u2328feed on sunny days, because\u2328they'll eat the grass here.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Make sure you bring them in\u2328for the night, though.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f4a\u2136One thing you have to watch\u2328out for when letting your\u2328animals out is the weather.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f4bDon't let them out when the\u2328weather's bad.\u232bIf you let your animals out\u2328when it's raining, they'll\u2328get stressed.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136The weather can be nice in\u2328the morning, but it can\u2328still rain in the afternoon.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136When the weather's too bad\u2328to let your animals out,\u2328feed them \u206dfodder\u206c.
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Take the fodder...
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136...And throw it in the feed\u2328box.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136Then, your animals will come\u2328and eat it!
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Oh, and if you put your\u2328fodder in \u206dstorage\u206c...
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136...You can take it out of\u2328that dispenser there!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136I sell fodder at my store,\u2328so stop by and buy some!
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136But first, I'll give you\u2328some as a housewarming\u2328gift!
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136One bag of fodder will last\u23285 meals, so you can hold 10\u2328meals worth in the feed box.
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Now, let me tell you how to\u2328keep your animals healthy.\u232bFirst, make sure to feed\u2328your animals once a day.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f4a\u2136And don't forget to talk\u2328to them, either!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136If you forget to feed them,\u2328or don't talk to them,\u2328they'll get stressed.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f4bIf they become too stressed,\u2328they'll get sick.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136If one of your animals gets\u2328sick, be sure to give them\u2328\u206dAnimal Medicine\u206c.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f4bIf you don't help them,\u2328they'll get sicker and\u2328sicker, and eventually die.\u232bYou don't want that, so make\u2328sure your animals have a\u2328long and happy life.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136But keep this in mind...\u232bNo matter how well you take\u2328care of your animals, they\u2328can't live forever...
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136You can get milk from\u2328healthy, adult cows.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136The stronger your bond, the\u2328better the milk will be!\u232bThat's why you need to make\u2328sure to take care of your\u2328animals every day!\u232bNow, I have a few things to\u2328give you. Let me do that\u2328before I forget!
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136This is a \u206dmilker\u206c!\u232bUse this to milk your cow.
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136This is a \u206dbrush\u206c! Use this to\u2328brush your animals and keep\u2328them clean.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Make sure to brush them\u2328every day, because they can\u2328get sick if they're dirty.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Also, let me explain\u2328something important to\u2328you...\u232bOn the upper left of\u2328the top screen is a\u2328blue gauge.\u232bThat gauge tells you how\u2328much \u206dStamina\u206c you have\u2328left.\u232bWhen you use a tool, \u206dit\u2328reduces your Stamina\u206c. You'll\u2328\u206dpass out\u206c if it gets empty.\u232bIf you pass out, you \u206dwon't\u2328be able to work anymore\u2328that day\u206c, so be careful.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136However, you can recover\u2328some Stamina by eating\u2328something.
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136This is the chicken coop.
\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f48\u2135The chicken coop is quite\u2328magnificent as well, don't\u2328you think?
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Here's the basics of how to\u2328care for your chickens.\u232bPut your chickens outside on\u2328sunny days, just like you do\u2328with your cows.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136If you do that, they'll find\u2328food on the ground to eat\u2328automatically!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Just pick up your chickens\u2328and put them in the fenced\u2328area outside.\u232bHere's the area you want to\u2328take them...
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136This area here!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Just like cows, make sure\u2328you bring your chickens back\u2328into the coop at night.\u232bRemember, though! Don't let\u2328them out when the weather's\u2328bad!
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136When the weather's too bad\u2328to let your chickens out,\u2328give them \u206dchicken feed\u206c.
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136\u206dThis area\u206c is where the\u2328chicken feed should be\u2328spread.\u232bJust like with fodder, if\u2328you put your chicken feed\u2328in \u206dstorage\u206c...
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Just like with the fodder\u2328if you put the chicken feed\u2328into \u206dstorage\u206c...
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136...You can take it out of\u2328that dispenser there!
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136Let me give you some chicken\u2328feed to start with!
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136One bag of chicken feed will\u2328last 5 meals.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136That means you can hold\u232810 meals worth in each\u2328feeding area.
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136In addition, healthy\u2328chickens will lay\u2328\u206deggs\u206c!\u232bThe stronger your bond, the\u2328better their eggs will be!\u232bThat's why you need to make\u2328sure to take care of your\u2328animals every day!\u232bAnd that's the basics\u2328of taking care of\u2328chickens!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136You should also give your\u2328animals \u206dtreats\u206c to become\u2328more friendly with them!
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136Here's some \u206dtreats\u206c. Give\u2328some to your animals\u2328later.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136You can only give an animal\u2328\u206done treat a day\u206c.\u232bAnimals like different kinds\u2328of treats, so feel free to\u2328experiment!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136If you give them treats they\u2328like, they'll give you more\u2328milk and eggs than usual!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136And that's basically all\u2328you need to know about\u2328caring for animals!\u232b\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f48\u2135That was quite detailed!\u2328Thank you, Jessica!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Don't mention it!
\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f48\u2135Well then, we should\u2328be getting back...
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Oh dear! I forgot to tell\u2328you something important!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136Once your animals are\u2328\u206dfully grown\u206c, they can\u2328\u206dhave babies\u206c!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136The animals I brought you\u2328are already full grown.\u232bThey can have babies\u2328whenever you want.\u232bIf you want an animal to\u2328have a baby, just bring\u2328it to my shop.\u232bI'll \u206dkeep it for about\u23282 weeks.\u206c\u232bBut remember, only \u206dhealthy\u206c\u2328animals can have babies!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136They can't be dirty, either.\u232bSo make sure you brush them\u2328before you bring them to\u2328the shop.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f48\u2135And that's how you have baby\u2328animals!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136Well, I'll be heading back\u2328to the shop now!\u232bYou've got a lot of work\u2328ahead of you! Good luck,\u2328\u232a!

Good luck,\u2328\u232a!
\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136Sorry to keep you waiting.
\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f48\u2135There's one more thing I\u2328need to tell you.\u2328\u232bOnce you get eggs and milk\u2328you can use them to\u2328\u206deat or cook with,\u206cor...\u232b\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f49\u2135You can\u2328\u206dship them and get money\u206c\u2328for them!
\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f48\u2135Now let me show you where\u2328the shipping bin is.\u2328Follow me.
\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f48\u2135This is the Bluebell Village\u2328\u206dShipping Bin\u206c.\u232bGo near the Shipping Bin and\u2328press the \u206dA Button\u206c and the\u2328Shipping Bin screen will\u232bappear on the bottom screen.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f49\u2135Just put the milk or other\u2328items you want to ship in\u2328and you can ship them.\u232bIsn't that easy?\u232b\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f48\u2135But watch out, because you\u2328can't an item back once you\u2328put it in the Shipping Bin.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f49\u2135The money you receive for\u2328items you ship will be\u232bdelivered to your house\u2328first thing in the morning.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f48\u2135Feel free to use the\u2328shipping bin whenever you\u2328you want!\u232bYou can also ship things\u2328you've found in the\u2328mountains here.\u232bYou can find all kinds of\u2328things in the mountains.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f49\u2135bamboo shoots, shimeji\u2328walnuts and herbs...\u232bThe mountains are full of\u2328delicious things!\u232bYou can find a lot, so you\u2328should\u206d bring your cart\u206c\u2328when you go.
\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f48\u2135Hmm? Is this the \u2328only shipping bin?\u232bWell...this is the\u2328only shipping bin here\u2328in Bluebell Village.\u232bBut I believe there's\u2328one in \u206eKonohana Village\u206c.\u2328\u232bVillagers from either town\u2328can use the shipping bins,\u2328so feel free to use it.\u232bI think it's right there\u2328when you come down the\u2328mountain.\u232bI'm sure when the villagers\u2328see the beautiful milk and\u2328eggs in their Shipping Bin,\u232b\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f49\u2135They'll be bowled over by\u2328just how amazing they are!

\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f48\u2135If you forget how to take on\u2328requests, take a look at the\u2328\u206dTown Hall bookshelf.\u206c\u232bYou can also find out where\u2328villagers' houses are there.\u232bThat's handy when you want\u2328to know where a requester\u2328lives.\u232bTown Hall is closed today,\u2328though, so you'll have\u2328to come tomorrow.\u232bWell, I'll see you later\u2328then, \u232a!
\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136And that's the basics of how\u2328you take care of cows.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136Let me explain how you take\u2328care of chickens next!
