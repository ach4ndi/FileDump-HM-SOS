\u1f41\u1fa4\u1f48\u2332 My mistake!\u2328 Just wanted to say hi!
\u1f40\u1faa\u1f4c\u2135\u232f\u206eAmir\u206c\u232c\u2328\u21f5I see.\u232bWell, you can leave now,\u2328then.
\u1f40\u1faa\u1f49\u2135\u232f\u206eAmir\u206c\u232c\u2328\u21f0Heh heh heh...
\u1f40\u1faa\u1f49\u2135\u232f\u206eAmir\u206c\u232c\u2328Sorry. It's just that I\u2328didn't expect that response.\u232bAnyway, that's fine.\u2328Please, come in.

I've got\u2328some studying to do.
