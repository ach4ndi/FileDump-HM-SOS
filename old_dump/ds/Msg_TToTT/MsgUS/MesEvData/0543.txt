\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f48\u2136Sorry to drop in so early in\u2328the morning. How are your\u2328crops growing?\u232b\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f49\u2136I'm going to teach you about\u2328\u206dirrigation trenches\u206c today.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f48\u2136Do you know about trenches?
\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f49\u2136Here's what an irrigation\u2328trench looks like!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f48\u2136When you grow crops in a\u2328trench, you can water and\u2328fertilize them all at once.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f49\u2136Handy, right?\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f48\u2136Trenches are very easy to\u2328make.\u232bWhile you're tilling with\u2328the hoe, keep the \u206d+Control\u2328Pad\u206c pressed in a direction!\u232bThen press the \u206dA Button\u206c\u2328over each new square you\u2328step on.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f49\u2136Each new square you till\u2328will be added to the trench.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f4b\u2136But you do have to watch out\u2328for one thing...\u232bTrenches must be in one\u2328unbroken line...\u232b\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f48\u2136You can't branch trenches\u2328or connect them up to each\u2328other, in other words.\u232bIf you make a mistake\u2328digging a trench,\u232byou can only fix it by\u2328hammering the ground flat\u2328and trying again.
\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f49\u2136So to make a trench like\u2328this, you'd till in a line\u2328from one arrow to the other.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f48\u2136But...\u270aif you leave a tilled\u2328square untended for a\u2328week...\u232b\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f4b\u2136The trench will disappear at\u2328that spot!\u232bIf that breaks a long trench\u2328in the middle, too bad!\u2328It can't be fixed.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f48\u2136That's why you need to be\u2328careful.
\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f48\u2136And that's basically what\u2328you need to know about\u2328irrigation trenches.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f48\u2136Would you like me to explain\u2328it to you one more time?
\u2332 Explain it again, please!\u2328 No thanks, I got it!
\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f49\u2136OK, I'll explain it again.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f48\u2136An irrigation trench is a\u2328continuous line of tilled\u2328squares.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f49\u2136Let me show you a trench and\u2328explain it to you.
\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f49\u2136Great! Happy farming!
\u2332 No, please teach me.\u2328 Yes, I already know.
\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f49\u2136All right, I'll explain!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f48\u2136An irrigation trench is a\u2328continuous line of tilled\u2328squares.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f49\u2136It's easiest to just show\u2328you an example.
\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f49\u2136Oh, you do?\u2328You're on the ball, aren't\u2328you?\u232b\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f48\u2136Well, happy farming!
