I'm\nwondering the fundamental reason why the\nmacaroni has a hole in it.\n<PAGE>\nI started by considering boiling time.\nHaving a hole in it makes it boil\nfaster. I quickly proved that fact.\n<PAGE>\nThen I considered how it feels to eat\nit. The softness when you bite, then\ncutting through with your teeth.\n<PAGE>\nYou can enjoy that lovely softness, so\nchewy, so perfect.\n<PAGE>\nYou can even hold it between your teeth\nand suck in air through it like a straw.\n<PAGE>\nAll of this makes it the ultimate in\nfood, surely! And the hole is vital to\nachieve this!"

      "Text": "<FACE_KUROZE><POS_RIGHT><FACE_NORMAL>\r\nThen, I turned to consideration of\nthe flavor. The flavor of macaroni is \ndetermined by the sauce.\n<PAGE>\nWhen you mix macaroni with the sauce, it\nalways gets inside that hole. This is a\nvital point! Maybe the key point!\n<PAGE>\nYou get the flavor coming out from\ninside the macaroni as you eat it. This\nis one of its principle characteristics!\n<PAGE>\nNext, appearance. Do you look upon \nmacaroni without giving it any thought?\nI am sure you do.\n<PAGE>\nYou don't even see it, I'm sure. That's\njust normal. Isn't it?\n<PAGE>\nBut have you never thought you might\nlike to peer into the hole in that\nmacaroni?"

The problem here is that\nmacaroni is bent.\n<PAGE>\nThat means you can't see anything even\nif you do try to peer down it. Which\njust means you want to see it even more.\n<PAGE>\nThat means you end up trying to stretch\nit out and see the other side.\n<PAGE>\nFinally, finally, you see through it...\nand such relief sets in!"
