you Part 5 in our
Exploration Series. {NextPage_1}We've gone off to the
forgotten island in
search of the{NextPage_1}Water Monkey.
.....................{NextPage_1}The Shikura Sea is
the Monkey Weeds'
natural habitat. {NextPage_1}In the middle of it,
there is an island
called "Komori",{NextPage_1}which you cannot find
on any maps.
The Yan-Yan Pond is{NextPage_1}located somewhere
on this island, and
it is the home of{NextPage_1}the Water Monkeys.
                     {NextPage_1}We've entered the
deepest parts of
Komori Island chasing{NextPage_1}after the elusive
Water Monkey.
The surface of the{NextPage_1}island was formed
from a volcanic
eruption. At first{NextPage_1}glance, there seems
no life.
Just where is the{NextPage_1}world is this
Yan-Yan Pond?
We began our journey{NextPage_1}in search of the pond
first.
Originally the{NextPage_1}Yan-Yan Pond was
discovered about{NextPage_1}100 years ago by
Joseph Nehit.
His diary is the only{NextPage_1}written record
we have of his
exploits. This is{NextPage_1}what was inside his
diary.
                    {NextPage_1}I could hear the
sound in the middle
of the night. {NextPage_1}"Yan-yan" it went.
I followed the noise
until I came{NextPage_1}across a giant lake.

"In Search of the{NextPage_1}Water Monkeys".
.....................
We waited for night{NextPage_1}to fall. When the
moon was exactly
overhead, we began to{NextPage_1}hear a very soft and
faint sound.
"Yan-yan, yan-yan..."{NextPage_1}we heard it say.
Relying on the moon-
light, we journeyed{NextPage_1}in the direction of
the sound. As we
moved closer we heard{NextPage_1}scratching from the
various openings
around us. {NextPage_1}The sound was
emanating from the
holes in the volcanic{NextPage_1}rocks. After
listening a while, we
then realized it{NextPage_1}wasn't just any sound,
it was the "yan-yan"
sound. {NextPage_1}Having found a
slightly larger
opening, we entered.{NextPage_1}Inside led to a much
narrower cave.
The moon illuminated{NextPage_1}the inside with
a beam of light.
After much traveling, {NextPage_1}suddenly something
appeared! We gasped
in surprise. {NextPage_1}.....................

"Mad Mad World"! {NextPage_1}Each show we travel

unique stories. {NextPage_1}Today we continue our
current story,
"In Search of the{NextPage_1}Water Monkeys".
                   {NextPage_1}In our last episode,
we were inside
a cave deep within{NextPage_1}Komori Island
when suddenly we were
aghast... {NextPage_1}What was it that
appeared before us!?
Watch and learn... {NextPage_1}.....................
                     {NextPage_1}We continued down the
long and narrow cave.
Unbelievably deep{NextPage_1}inside was an amazing
spectacle that spread
out before us. {NextPage_1}A dome about 150 feet
tall towered above
us. At the top of the{NextPage_1}dome was a large
opening. A large pool
stretched out before{NextPage_1}us, reflecting light
as if the moon had
fallen inside. {NextPage_1}At the long last we
had discovered
the Yan-Yan Pond! {NextPage_1}We couldn't see it
clearly due to
the darkness, but we{NextPage_1}could make out
black shadows of some
fallen trees. {NextPage_1}Mesmerized by the
spectacle, we were
suddenly brought{NextPage_1}back to reality
by a "yan-yan" coming
from the dome. {NextPage_1}Although we could see
no trace, no one
doubted any longer{NextPage_1}that this was the
cry of the Water
Monkeys. It's called{NextPage_1}the Water Monkey, so
we naturally assumed
it would be in the{NextPage_1}water. If that was
the case though, how
were we able to hear{NextPage_1}it's cries? Watching
the waters surface
intently, we noticed{NextPage_1}the shadows of the
fallen branches move
occasionally. {NextPage_1}We stood there with
our eyes locked
in the direction of{NextPage_1}the waters surface.

.....................
                     {NextPage_1}...Monkeys.
Watching the movement
there was no doubt{NextPage_1}that they were
motions of monkeys. {NextPage_1}Up in the trees,
there were countless
numbers of them{NextPage_1}moving about.
Could they be the
Water Monkeys? {NextPage_1}How long did we stand
there watching?
The light briefly{NextPage_1}outlined a monkey's
shape, and in an
instant it vanished{NextPage_1}into the water. Our
eyes chased the
monkey into the{NextPage_1}watery depths.
As we peered into the
pool, we saw{NextPage_1}countless monkeys
swimming. At last we
had found the{NextPage_1}Water Monkeys!

.....................{NextPage_1}In a remote village
far deep in the
mountains, there is{NextPage_1}one particular place
blanketed by groves
of chestnut trees. {NextPage_1}It is here that I,
the great reporter
Suzuki shall{NextPage_1}investigate this
"Chestnut Festival".
Personally, I am{NextPage_1}clueless as to the
kind this may be, but
I'm very curious. {NextPage_1}Oh, it looks like
they're about to
start, so let's head{NextPage_1}on over and take
a look around.
Well, let me see...{NextPage_1}Now, I know the
festival is being
held in the village{NextPage_1}square... Uh...but
where exactly IS the
village square? {NextPage_1}Hmmm, let me try
asking someone
around here. {NextPage_1}

Suzuki: "Excuse me,
sir? Do you know
the way to get to the{NextPage_1}village square?"
Old Man: "You're
gonna go to the{NextPage_1}square looking like
that, ya? You'll be
in serious pain." {NextPage_1}Suzuki: "Um...I don't
quite understand..."
Old Man: "Chestnuts{NextPage_1}hurt, ya know?
Oh, the square is
over that way." {NextPage_1}Suzuki: "Um...thanks.
I guess... I'm just a
little unnerved right{NextPage_1}now. I'll try asking
someone else."
....................{NextPage_1}Suzuki: "Um...excuse
me?"
Old Woman: "You're{NextPage_1}not really going to
to go to the square
dressed like that, {NextPage_1}are ya? You're gonna
be in so much pain."
Suzuki: "Um, but why{NextPage_1}would I be in pain?"
Old Woman: "Chestnuts
hurt. Oh well, the{NextPage_1}square is right
over yonder."
Suzuki: "Um...thanks.{NextPage_1}I guess... Now I'm
really worried...
....................{NextPage_1}Oh, there's the
square. Looks like
the festival{NextPage_1}activities are
about to get started.
Let's get closer!{NextPage_1}...Aaaaah! Ouch!!!
Geh...! Eeeeeek!!!
Owwww! Ch...ch... {NextPage_1}chestnu...
Chestnut fes...
Aaaaah! ......{NextPage_1}Well, that was quite
a surprise. Turns out
the Chestnut Festival{NextPage_1}is the local custom
of throwing chestnut
burs to each other. {NextPage_1}Thanks for all your
hard work, Suzuki.

I, Geraldo Rimera,

you all.
....................{NextPage_1}

According to my
sources, this is the
place... {NextPage_1}I see people walking
around, but I don't
see any trees around{NextPage_1}here at all...
I'm going to ask
somebody. {NextPage_1}Rimera: "Excuse me,
have you seen any
walking trees around{NextPage_1}here recently?"
Villager: "Yeah,
it's right there. {NextPage_1}One's over there."
Rimera: "Right there?
Over there too? {NextPage_1}I don't see any
around here, but..."
Villager: "Of course{NextPage_1}ya don't see any
trees. They're
walking trees. {NextPage_1}See, one over there,
and right there."
Rimera: "I still{NextPage_1}don't see them.
Where in the world
are they?" {NextPage_1}Villager: "You're a
strange one, aren't
ya? They're all{NextPage_1}around!"
...Let's ask another
person, shall we?{NextPage_1}Rimera: "Excuse me,
do you know where I
can find the walking{NextPage_1}trees around here?"
Walking Tree: "We're
the Walking Trees. {NextPage_1}We were once normal
trees, but we've
evolved enough to be{NextPage_1}able to walk.
Everyone here is a
Walking Tree." {NextPage_1}...It doesn't seem
like asking anyone
else will help... {NextPage_1}We'll just call it
quits for now.
....................{NextPage_1}A job well done,
Rimera.
Seems like a very{NextPage_1}eccentric village.

.....................{NextPage_1}We'd heard about a

have lived longer{NextPage_1}than anywhere else in
the world. We've sent
out our ace reporter, {NextPage_1}Geraldo Rimera to
investigate it.
As expected, after{NextPage_1}walking around the
village, I've seen
only elderly people{NextPage_1}around. Let's go up
and introduce
ourselves. {NextPage_1}Rimera: "Excuse me,
sir..."
Old Man: "Hmm?" {NextPage_1}Rimera: "Just how old
are you, sir?"
Old Man: "I'm 100{NextPage_1}years old, sonny."

someone else." {NextPage_1}Other Old Man: "Hey,
you. I'm 105 and the
oldest here." {NextPage_1}Rimera: "Is that so?"
Old Man: "What're ya
talking about? {NextPage_1}Well then... I'm 110!
Beat that!"
Other Old Man: "Oh, {NextPage_1}yeah? I'm 120!"
Old Woman: "You two,
stop fighting. {NextPage_1}Everyone knows I'm
the oldest.
After all I'm 132."{NextPage_1}Old Man: "Truth be
told, I'm 148!
Didn't know that, {NextPage_1}did ya?"
Old Woman: "Well, if
you're 148, {NextPage_1}then I'm 158!"
Other Old Man: "You
can't beat me! {NextPage_1}I'm 160 years old!"
Rimera: "Um...
guys...?" {NextPage_1}Old Man: "Listen to
me, son. You'd better
believe I'm really{NextPage_1}170."
Old Woman: "Oh yeah,
well, I'm 200 years{NextPage_1}old!"
Other Old Man: "Oh,
yeah? Then I'm..."{NextPage_1}...A village of

We'll just leave it{NextPage_1}at that for now.

....................{NextPage_1}Investigative

on the scene. {NextPage_1}We've come to shed
light on the rumors
about the mysterious{NextPage_1}stairs in this
building. Seems as if
nobody living here...{NextPage_1}All the rooms are
lined up, doesn't
seem to be any stairs{NextPage_1}around here. I'm
going into one of
the rooms. {NextPage_1}The inside of the
room is...Oh!
There's the stairs. {NextPage_1}I'm now going to try
climbing them.
Hmmm...{NextPage_1}Doesn't seem like
anything changed.
The room above is the{NextPage_1}same as the last one.
Oh, there's another
set of stairs. {NextPage_1}I'll climb up them
and see...
Well...{NextPage_1}

...Maybe we're in a
wrong building...
Nothing really{NextPage_1}changed again.
Same room and more
stairs... {NextPage_1}I'll take a quick
walk outside.
It's the same hallway{NextPage_1}I came in...?
It's the same
entrance I came in{NextPage_1}as well...
Could it be...?
Could it possibly...?{NextPage_1}

Waaaah!!
I've gone outside!
I climbed up 2{NextPage_1}flights of starts,
but exited the room!
I'm back on the 1st{NextPage_1}floor... I'm gonna
try that again.
This time I'll try it{NextPage_1}from another room.

"Who is it?" {NextPage_1}"We're from Mad Mad

with the amazing fire{NextPage_1}breathing little
brother. Oh, the door

you Part 7 in
our Mystery Series, {NextPage_1}"The Lost Stairs".
....................{NextPage_1}Investigative
Reporter Suzuki
on the scene. {NextPage_1}We've come to shed
light on the rumors
about the mysterious{NextPage_1}stairs in this
building. Seems as if
nobody living here...{NextPage_1}All the rooms are
lined up, doesn't
seem to be any stairs{NextPage_1}around here. I'm
going into one of
the rooms. {NextPage_1}The inside of the
room is...Oh!
There's the stairs. {NextPage_1}I'm now going to try
climbing them.
Hmmm...{NextPage_1}Doesn't seem like
anything changed.
The room above is the{NextPage_1}same as the last one.
Oh, there's another
set of stairs. {NextPage_1}I'll climb up them
and see...
Well...{NextPage_1}

...Maybe we're in a
wrong building...
Nothing really{NextPage_1}changed again.
Same room and more
stairs... {NextPage_1}I'll take a quick
walk outside.
It's the same hallway{NextPage_1}I came in...?
It's the same
entrance I came in{NextPage_1}as well...
Could it be...?
Could it possibly...?{NextPage_1}

Waaaah!!
I've gone outside!
I climbed up 2{NextPage_1}flights of starts,
but exited the room!
I'm back on the 1st{NextPage_1}floor... I'm gonna
try that again.
This time I'll try it{NextPage_1}from another room.

Suzuki since

message. "There is NO
WAY OUT!" {NextPage_1}She still hasn't come
back.

around looking for
unique stories. {NextPage_1}This time we bring
you Part 12 in
our Village Stories, {NextPage_1}the "Village of
Longevity".
.....................{NextPage_1}We'd heard about a
village where people
have lived longer{NextPage_1}than anywhere else in
the world. We've sent
out our ace reporter, {NextPage_1}Geraldo Rimera to
investigate it.
As expected, after{NextPage_1}walking around the
village, I've seen
only elderly people{NextPage_1}around. Let's go up
and introduce
ourselves. {NextPage_1}Rimera: "Excuse me,
sir..."
Old Man: "Hmm?" {NextPage_1}Rimera: "Just how old
are you, sir?"
Old Man: "I'm 100{NextPage_1}years old, sonny."
Rimera: "Oh, my you
have lived so long."{NextPage_1}Old Man: "I'm the
oldest one in the
village." {NextPage_1}Rimera: "I see...
Let's interview
someone else." {NextPage_1}Other Old Man: "Hey,
you. I'm 105 and the
oldest here." {NextPage_1}Rimera: "Is that so?"
Old Man: "What're ya
talking about? {NextPage_1}Well then... I'm 110!
Beat that!"
Other Old Man: "Oh, {NextPage_1}yeah? I'm 120!"
Old Woman: "You two,
stop fighting. {NextPage_1}Everyone knows I'm
the oldest.
After all I'm 132."{NextPage_1}Old Man: "Truth be
told, I'm 148!
Didn't know that, {NextPage_1}did ya?"
Old Woman: "Well, if
you're 148, {NextPage_1}then I'm 158!"
Other Old Man: "You
can't beat me! {NextPage_1}I'm 160 years old!"
Rimera: "Um...
guys...?" {NextPage_1}Old Man: "Listen to
me, son. You'd better
believe I'm really{NextPage_1}170."
Old Woman: "Oh yeah,
well, I'm 200 years{NextPage_1}old!"
Other Old Man: "Oh,
yeah? Then I'm..."{NextPage_1}...A village of
longevity indeed...
We'll just leave it{NextPage_1}at that for now.
.....................{NextPage_1}That was certainly
some village.
Until next time!
