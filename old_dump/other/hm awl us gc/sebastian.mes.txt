Oh no...!
You found it...!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And I thought if I
doubled the photos up
no one would {NextPage_1}find them...!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Would you please
keep this a secret...
For me, sir?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Awww!! If it isn't
{CharName_0}! How long
have you been {NextPage_1}standing there, sir?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So-sorry, sir...
I zoned out...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was thinking...
I've been taking care
of Miss Romana for{NextPage_1}several decades now.
How much longer will
I be able to...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If something happened
to me, what would
become of{NextPage_1}Miss Romana and
Miss Lumina...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you so much,
{CharName_0}!
I am in your debt!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You are right, sir.
I am embarrassed to
think about it...{NextPage_49}
Please don't tell
any of this to
Miss Romana!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I left the
photograph out
by accident...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see why you'd
say so, but it's
Miss Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes...Very good
observation. It is
indeed Miss Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Huh? {32_3_32}
!!!{NextPage_49}
That's right! It is
a picture of my
mother!{NextPage_49}
It's certainly not
Miss Romana!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm? {32_2_188}Yes...
Thank you, sir...{NextPage_49}
Did you notice...?
Oh, nothing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's Miss Romana
taken at the same age
Miss Lumina is now.{NextPage_49}
That's why it looks
so much like her.{NextPage_49}
It was taken when
photos were still a
rarity, so this is{NextPage_1}the only picture of
Miss Romana at this
age. If she knew I{NextPage_1}had it, she'd laugh
at me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Would you please
promise not to tell
her about it, sir?
{41_2_0}Nope.
Sure, no problem.
----------x----------
Please? I beg it of
you!
{41_2_0}OK, I give in.
Nope.
----------x----------
Thank you so much,
sir!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess it was my
fault for being so
careless...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is it, {32_1_244}
Miss Romana?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see. {32_1_244}
I will fetch it
immediately.{NextPage_49}
Excuse me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have done what you
asked, Miss Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've left it on the
shelf in the
{Location_43_23_23},{NextPage_1}so please use it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you'll excuse me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_2}{CharName_0}...
I can't believe you
would go before me...{NextPage_49}
I shall take care of
{CharName_1} for you.
Don't worry...{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
Would you sing a song
to put {CharName_0}'s
soul at rest,{NextPage_1}{CharName_27}? {32_7_208}I'm sure
his soul can hear
it...{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
Err..Excuse me, sir?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I trouble you,
{CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}...Oh my, it
seems you are out of
everything right now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I suppose I should
call sometime later.{NextPage_49}
The early bird gets
the worm, as
they say!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm looking for some-
thing special to make
Miss Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please don't trouble
yourself on my
account.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm...I don't think
there's anything here
that would please{NextPage_1}Miss Romana...
At least not
right now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Is there anything
else...? Something
special left?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's see...
What should I...?
...Hmm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry to trouble you.
I don't need
anything now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}You came recently,
didn't you? I care
for Miss Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_2}.........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...I'm terribly
sorry...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_4}......!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_4}Sorry, but I'm
busy right now!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}I always like to
get an early start
on my day's work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Good day.
How is your work
coming?{NextPage_49}
Me? Well, it's always
a treat caring for
Miss Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to start
cooking dinner...{NextPage_49}
There is always more
to do for Miss
Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Hello, {CharName_0}.
What brings you here
so late at night?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello, {CharName_0}.
What brings you here
so late at night?{NextPage_49}
It couldn't be...
{34_1_63}Oh, never mind.
I worry too much.{NextPage_49}
Pleased to see you
so late.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}How wonderful to
see you, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What brings you here
so late?{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_3}...
{34_1_63}Ha ha... {32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
Well, I guess they do
say history is
made at night! {NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_9}Sorry, sir.
I got carried away...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Good day,
{CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}Would you be
willing to part with
some of that...?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}I am in your
debt. I look forward
to eating it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_2}Is that so...
Pardon me for asking
in the first place.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}That's my favorite
food. I cook for Miss
Romana, so I have{NextPage_1}excellent taste.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}That looks
scrumptious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Please come to
the villa. I'll
cook you a treat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can never perfect
a cuisine, but it
begins with{NextPage_1}selecting the
freshest ingredients.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks very good.
I would know,
you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are my
favorite, if you'll
excuse my saying so.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}I'm not usually
very picky, but I
can't abide those...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Looking at them
over and over again
doesn't help, either.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Sorry, but I
just can't eat that.{NextPage_49}
Please don't tell
Miss Romana, though.{NextPage_49}
I always tell her
being too picky
isn't healthy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Sorry, but that would
just be wasted on
me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Sorry, but I'm really
not interested.{NextPage_49}
Pearls to swine,
and all that...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}What a cute
baby. He takes after
Celia, doesn't he?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Miss Lumina was also
terribly cute as a
child...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}What a healthy
baby. He takes after
Muffy, doesn't he?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Miss Lumina was also
very healthy as a
child...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}Would you be
willing to model for
my next painting?{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_9}Of course, I have
to finish the current
one first...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}What a quiet
baby. He takes after
Nami, doesn't he?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Miss Lumina sure
wasn't very quiet
as a baby...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}Your dog looks very
clever.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Since time immemorial
dogs and humans
have shared a special{NextPage_1}bond. I'm sure you
and your dog will
do the same.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a nice dog.
I value a dog's
loyalty highly.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}What a cute cat.
I prefer dogs, but
cats are nice too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes I envy you,
living as you do
with animals.{NextPage_49}
It would be so nice
to just take care of
animals, paint,{NextPage_49}
and relax...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But, I would never
leave Miss Romana for
anything.{NextPage_49}
So...Just forget I
said all that, sir?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Is this chicken
from your farm? I bet
it lays nice eggs!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A stressed out
chicken lays stressed
out eggs, which are{NextPage_1}not healthy at all.
Please take care of
your chickens.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}What a nice
fat duck this is.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
In a country far
away they make a dish
where they fatten{NextPage_1}a duck up, then roast
it whole.{NextPage_49}
Miss Romana says it's
heavenly, and she
must be right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}It looks like
a good seed to me,
not that I know very{NextPage_1}much about
agriculture...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}Please make them
into a good crop.
I'm always looking{NextPage_1}for good ingredients
for Miss Romana and
Miss Lumina!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you grow that
crop? It looks very
delectable indeed.{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_10}Err...May I have it?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
That looks very
good indeed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want to give Miss
Romana as much
variety in her diet{NextPage_1}as I can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Is this milk from
your farm?
It looks so fresh.{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_10}Err...May I have it?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
Good milk becomes
good cheese. Consider
making cheese{NextPage_1}with this milk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's very fresh
milk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make this
cheese? Mmm...
Looks very good...{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_10}Err...May I have it?
I just adore dairy
products... {40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}To tell you the
truth...I'm surprised
at how excellent this{NextPage_1}cheese is. I'm an
expert on cheese,
so I should know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The quality of cheese
is determined by
the milk.{NextPage_49}
It would make me so
happy to use it in a
dish for Miss Romana.{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
There are so many
delectable kinds of
cheese to try...{NextPage_49}
Brie, Rouqefort,
Gouda, Valencay, to
name just a few...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There is a huge
variety of cheeses,
but they are all{NextPage_1}either processed
or natural.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make this
butter? Mmm...
Looks very good...{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_10}Err...May I have it?
I just adore dairy
products... {40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}This is excellent
butter. I would love
to use it in a dish{NextPage_1}for Miss Romana!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cooking with butter
is very good, but we
have to be careful{NextPage_1}not to use too
much, sir.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}That butter sure does
look good. What would
I use it for...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Did that egg come
from your farm?
It looks very fresh.{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_10}Err...May I have it?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
There are many kinds
of egg dishes, some
quite sophisticated.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Miss Lumina loves my
omelet rice recipe.{NextPage_49}
Miss Romana loves my
egg souffle. Do you
know what that is?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is a good egg.
You must treat your
chickens very well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Did you catch that
fish? I'm impressed.{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_10}Err...May I have it?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
I don't know anything
about fishing, but
I do know fish.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This fish would be
good in a stew,
baked, or even raw.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Truly a great fish...
If it were mine, I'd
put it in a lovely{NextPage_1}stew for Miss
Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you gather those
wild plants around
here?{NextPage_49}
They look
particularly suited
to cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Some wild plants are
dangerous, you know.
Exercise caution.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Most plants in
Forget-Me-Not Valley
are safe...{NextPage_1}{50_10_0_2}But you never
know...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
These look good
indeed. If it were
me, I would mix them{NextPage_1}with rice to serve
to Miss Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}I know my
cooking, and that is
just exquisite.{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_10}Err...May I have it?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
Cooking is an art,
you know. Start with
ingredients,{NextPage_1}then do preparation,
cooking, spices,
presentation...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks
exquisite. Miss
Romana would love it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Is that a hoe?
I don't know much
about them, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Working on the
fields? I admire
your determination.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear that farm
tools get better
with use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Is that a good
sickle? It's not
my field...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_2}I implore you
not to swing that
thing around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}Is that watering
can from Miss Romana?{NextPage_49}
How are you
enjoying it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's an odd one,
but should be easy
to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}That's the watering
can Miss Romana gave
you, isn't it?{NextPage_49}
I'd recognize it
anywhere.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}Is that the
watering can that
Miss Romana gave you?{NextPage_49}
Use it in good
health.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a new
watering can?{NextPage_49}
Don't forget to use
it
for living things.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That watering can
looks very well used.{NextPage_49}
Never forget that
all living things
need water.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_2}Do you intend to
water here? Is there
a point to doing so?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}I can tell by
your watering can
that you are serious{NextPage_1}about caring for your
crops. Good job.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an old watering
can! Must be a joy
to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that an automatic
milker? How things
have progressed...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Milk contains lots of
calcium, which is
good for bones.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_2}I didn't think
there were any cows
around these parts...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those wool clippers
look hard to
handle...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}When I was young,
I used clippers to
shave my head bald.{NextPage_49}
...What, you don't
believe me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You use those to
shear sheep, sir?
Please be careful.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those clippers look
new. Are they?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You seem to be
getting good use out
of those clippers.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Could you shave a
human head with those
clippers, sir?{NextPage_49}
{34_1_63}I used to shave
my head as a youth,
you know...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}Those clippers
look like they've
seen years of use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
New tools are
difficult to use, but
once you get the{NextPage_1}hang of them,
everything gets
easier.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Doesn't holding a new
tool make you want
to get to work?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you love and use a
tool, it will reward
you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}The better you get
at using your tools,
the faster you'll{NextPage_1}be able to work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Now that tool looks
like it's been around
for a while...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}Looking at a
well-worn tool just
makes me happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Is that stone rare?
Sorry, I have no
expertise in rocks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Rare stones and the
like sell for lots of
money, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_3}Now this is a rare
find. I'm quite a
collector, myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Would you be willing
to part with that?
{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}I will treasure
it forever.{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_9}Do you think
I have strange
tastes...? {32_3_232}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}I see...
That's too bad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You gathered those
plants around
here, sir?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear that some
plants in this area
have strange and{NextPage_1}wonderful properties.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can eat wild
plants, but not
grasses, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a pretty
flower.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}How unusual.
A record.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is the
recording of?{NextPage_49}
I collect antiques,
you see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Records and songs
have a long and
fascinating history.{NextPage_49}
They can trigger
personal memories
as well...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I used to listen to
music all the time,
and I still love to{NextPage_1}relax to classical
recordings...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}What a rare spice you
have there. Where did
you find it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd love to be able
to use it for Miss
Romana...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}Just thinking of the
things I could make
with that sends{NextPage_1}shivers down my
spine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}What an interesting
sound that is!{NextPage_49}
I'm a classical music
aficionado, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}Somehow I find
that sound
relaxing...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_66}{32_5_220}What an unusual
drum? Where did you
unearth it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a nice medal
that is.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you win it in
a competition?
I never could...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If there were a
butler's competition,
I bet I could take{NextPage_49}
first place, though.
...Why do you think
that's funny?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh yeah...I think I
have seen that medal
somewhere before...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an odd
necklace that is.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I am very familiar
with fine jewelry,
but I can't figure{NextPage_49}
out where that
necklace is from.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}No, no,
I don't want it
myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think that's the
same kind of music
notation that{NextPage_1}Miss Lumina brought
back with her...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you get that
from Miss Lumina?{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_9}She must have
given it to you
because she{NextPage_1}couldn't play it
herself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Me? I don't play
either. I just listen
and appreciate.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet that firework
is glorious when
set off.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Depending on their
chemical composition,
fireworks can have{NextPage_1}all kinds of colors
and shapes. What kind
is that, I wonder?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please call me when
you set it off.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}A present? For me?
Thanks, but I really
couldn't accept it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_3}Ha ha, is it a
gift for someone?
Could it be for...!?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Sorry, I guess I
was just assuming...
Never mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}That's a gift for
someone, sir? Why
show it to me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've been serving
Miss Romana for
decades now...{NextPage_49}
The years have
just flown by.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My father served Miss
Romana's family, too.{NextPage_49}
We've known each
other since we were
babies.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If I could, I would
stay by her side all
day...{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_9}But, that gets on her
nerves, so I take
walks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_3}That dish you gave me
the other day was
truly superb.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}That dish you gave me
the other day...Well,
let's just say{NextPage_1}I'd rather not eat it
again. I'm
terribly sorry...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}That {29_0}
you gave me the other
day...{NextPage_49}
It was a good effort,
but it still needs
work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}That {29_0}
you gave me the other
day...{NextPage_49}
It was excellent.
I'd eat it again
any time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}That {29_0}
you gave me the other
day...{NextPage_49}
It was the best I've
ever had. Please
teach me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}That {29_0}
you gave me the other
day...{NextPage_49}
I loved it. I could
use it for almost
any dish!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk you gave me
tasted so nutritious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}The milk you gave me
was...err...
Oh, never mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}I don't mean to
insult, but I think
you can do better{NextPage_49}
than the milk you
gave me.
Don't take it hard.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk you gave me
the other day was
high quality, but...{NextPage_1}somehow I expected
a little more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}The milk you gave me
was superior to all
other milks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}The milk you gave me
was...err...{NextPage_49}
Let's just say it
might be better
as cheese.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}I don't mean to
insult, but I think
you can do better{NextPage_1}than the milk you
gave me.
Don't take it hard.{NextPage_49}
Perhaps it would be
better processed as
cheese...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk you gave me
the other day was
high quality, but...{NextPage_1}somehow I expected
a little more.{NextPage_49}
It might be better
as cheese.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}The milk you gave me
was superior to all
other milks.{NextPage_49}
However, think of
the cheese it would
make.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk you gave
me was very high
quality, but perhaps{NextPage_1}a little...thin.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}The milk you gave
me was very fine.
Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}The milk you gave me
was nice and thick.
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}The milk you gave me
was superior to all
other milks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}The milk you gave me
was...err...{NextPage_49}
Let's just say it
might be better
as butter.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}I don't mean to
insult, but I think
you can do better{NextPage_1}than the milk you
gave me.
Don't take it hard.{NextPage_49}
Perhaps it would be
better processed as
butter...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk you gave me
the other day was
high quality, but...{NextPage_49}
somehow I expected
a little more.{NextPage_49}
It might be better
used as butter.
What do you think?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}The milk you gave me
was superior to all
other milks.{NextPage_49}
However, I have to
say it was a
little thick. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}The milk you
gave me the other day
was a tad stinky.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}The milk you gave
me was very good,
if a tad stinky.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}I was completely
bowled over by the
cheese you gave me.{NextPage_49}
It was truly superb.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}The cheese you
gave me was a little
too pungent,{NextPage_1}but otherwise
quite good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}The cheese you
gave me was some of
the finest I've ever{NextPage_49}
tasted...And I've
had the finest.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that
cheese you gave
me, didn't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}The butter you
gave me was very
flavorful indeed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}The butter you
gave me was a tad
too pungent, but{NextPage_1}still quite a good
effort.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}That butter you
gave me was some of
the finest I've ever{NextPage_1}tasted...And I've
had the finest.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that
butter you gave
me, didn't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}I was completely
bowled over by that
{29_0}.{NextPage_49}
It made me realize
I should never stop
aspiring to improve{NextPage_49}
for Miss Romana's
sake!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}That dish you
gave me was
scrumptious.{NextPage_49}
You are an
inspiration, sir.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}That fish you
caught and gave to
me was a delicacy.{NextPage_49}
One could cook
anything with
such a fish.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}That fish you
caught and gave to me
was quite a treat.{NextPage_49}
Perhaps I should take
up fishing...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}I see you are
making every effort
on the farm.{NextPage_49}
You should be
commended.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}I hear your crops
are some of the best
around.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}I hear your crops are
delicious. I am half
jealous, I must say.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}I can see how hard
you're working. It
shows in your face.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}I hear you have
developed into quite
the cook.{NextPage_49}
I mustn't let you
get ahead of me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looks like you're
getting used to the
farming life.{NextPage_49}
Remember what they
say about Rome not
being built in a day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looks like you're
getting better at
raising crops.{NextPage_49}
Remember what they
say about Rome not
being built in a day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looks like you're
getting better
at cooking.{NextPage_49}
Remember what they
say about Rome not
being built in a day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you think of
my painting hobby?
{41_2_1}I don't get it.
Nice.
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}That's too bad...
Many people fail to
understand it...{NextPage_49}
Thanks for your
candor, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}Thank you so
much for saying so,
even if you{NextPage_1}aren't sincere.
I think I'll go
paint now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've never been
formally trained,
but it does{NextPage_1}soothe me for some
reason.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Why don't you
give it a try?
You might like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}I like coming here
once in a while.{NextPage_49}
...What, that
surprises you. sir?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My favorite is
{13}Cherry Pink{17}.{NextPage_49}
It's old fashioned,
but so am I.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}Drink up, {CharName_0}.
We're here to have
fun, after all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}Make yourself
at home. Not that
it's my home...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}Take a load off
and relax.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}The music and food
here always make
me relax.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}I see you like
it here too, sir.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}Nature becomes so
beautiful in the
spring.{NextPage_49}
It's my favorite time
to sketch landscapes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}Isn't this a
pleasant season?{NextPage_49}
It must be nice
for working outdoors.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}What do you think
of Forget-Me-Not
Valley's weather?{NextPage_49}
I don't like the
heat myself... It
slows down my work...{NextPage_49}
...Ha! {50_10_0_0}
Oh, no. The weather
doesn't change the{NextPage_49}
quality of my work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Aren't you hot?
I don't like the
heat much...{NextPage_49}
Or the cold,
for that matter!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}This is my favorite
season of all. Not
too hot or too cold.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}The fall leaves
are a fantastic
subject for painting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}It's so hard to work
in the winter.
My bones get so stiff.{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_0}Of course, I still
perform all my
duties. Of course.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9} Aren't you cold?
I don't like the
cold much...{NextPage_49}
Or the heat,
for that matter...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Miss Lumina's mother
was quite a talented
pianist, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_4}Shhh...
Miss Lumina is
practicing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_4}...Please be
quiet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}...Sorry...
I didn't mean to
lose my temper.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}I tried to stop her,
but Miss Lumina
insisted on helping{NextPage_1}me clean up. What a
kind heart she is.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Miss Lumina
really is a
gentle soul.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Miss Kate wants to
listen to my stories.{NextPage_49}
I wonder if I'll be
any help to her...{NextPage_49}
I'm pleased to share
my stories with her,
though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}I-I-I'm honored...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Pardon my rudeness,
but might you give
it to me next time?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's my bedtime now,
so...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dreadfully sorry, but
I really must get
some sleep.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night, sir...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have many errands
to run now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really must
leave now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Excuse me, but
I must go.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How may I be of
service, {32_1_44}
Miss Lumina?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I must leave now, but
you take your time,
{CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have nothing
against you, but
this is for{NextPage_1}Miss Lumina's sake.{32_0_200}
Prepare yourself,
sir!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm coming!
Toooohhh!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't believe it...
I wanted to give Miss
Lumina the best{NextPage_1}paintbrush I could...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's the matter, {32_1_44}
Miss Lumina?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sure. {32_1_44}No problem.{NextPage_0}
