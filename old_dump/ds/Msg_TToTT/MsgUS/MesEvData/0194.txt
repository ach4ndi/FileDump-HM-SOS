Ah, that felt good!\u2328There's nothing like a\u2328nice, warm bath!
That was nice. I just took a\u2328bath earlier, though, so I\u2328don't think it helped...
Ah, I feel better!
Hmm. I'd just used it\u2328before, so I don't think\u2328I needed that.
Wow, that felt so good! Hot\u2328springs are great! They're\u2328so soothing and relaxing.
Hmm... Usually, Hot springs\u2328are great, but the water was\u2328a bit too hot that time...
