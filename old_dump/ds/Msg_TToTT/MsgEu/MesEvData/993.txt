\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136Hmm...
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136Oh, sorry. I was just\u2328thinking about something.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Oh, it's nothing big. A\u2328friend of mine who lives in\u2328the city is getting married.\u232bHe's really done a lot for\u2328me over the years, so I\u2328wanted to help him out.\u232bHis fiancÂ†e likes pink, so I\u2328thought I'd make a bouquet\u2328using mainly pink and white.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136But I'm not sure what flower\u2328I should use to accent the\u2328bouquet. 
\u2332 How about pink roses?\u2328 Gerberas would be great!
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136I want to offset the\u2328rest of the bouquet...\u232bIf I use flowers of the\u2328same color, they'll\u2328just get lost in it.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136Hmm... Sorry I wasn't much\u2328fun today...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136I'm going to head home\u2328now. See you.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Wow, you think so?\u232bI was actually thinking I\u2328should use gerberas...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136If you think so too,\u2328then gerberas must\u2328be the right choice.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136Thanks, \u232a.\u2328I always value\u2328your opinion!\u232bI'll go home and\u2328start working on\u2328that bouquet, then.\u232bThanks for hanging out\u2328with me today.\u2328See you later!
