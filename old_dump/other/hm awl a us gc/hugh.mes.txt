{50_13_0_7}I don't like Kate
one bit!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_4}I said no!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_7}I can't stand having my Dad
cut my hair!
{CharName_16} always makes fun of me.{NextPage_49}
and calls me “onion head”!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_7}I don't care!
I said I don't like it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_7}Stupid old Dad!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_0}W-woah!
You scared me!
{50_13_0_25}How long have you been there?
{41_2_0}I just got here.
For a while.
----------x----------
Oh, that's good.
No problem then...{NextPage_49}
Oh, never mind.
Just a private matter...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_26}W-what?
R-r-really?{NextPage_49}
I don't suppose you heard me
talking to myself?
{41_2_0}No, not really...
N-n-not really...
----------x----------
{50_13_0_2}That's a little suspicious...
Are you sure you didn't hear anything?
{41_2_0}Sure...
S-s-sure...
----------x----------
{50_13_0_4}I knew there was something fishy here...
Are you really really sure?
{41_2_0}Really really sure.
Oh, I heard something about {CharName_16}....
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}Oh my! How embarrassing!
{50_13_0_26}I d-don't like {CharName_16}
or anything...
{41_2_0}Oh, I see...
Really?
----------x----------
{50_13_0_4}It's true!
Of course it's true!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_0}Right now all she does is pick on me,
but I'll show her someday!{NextPage_49}
{50_13_0_2}ah!{32_2_188}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_26}Don't say anything to {CharName_16} about this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_26}Yeah, really. Of course I'd be lying if I
said I didn't care about her at all...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_4}N-n-now look what you made me say!{NextPage_49}
I don't like {CharName_16}
at all, OK?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_25}Whew... That was a close one.{NextPage_49}
Pant, pant... {CharName_1}'s
pretty... fast... pant, pant...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's see, we need somebody
to be the starter...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Old Dad shouldn't push himself too hard.
Now that he's a senior citizen and all...{32_3_232}
Ha, ha, ha...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey mister...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Over here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Over here, ma'am.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What're you doin' here ma'am?
This is where Van always is...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't have anything
I like...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm just lookin'.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Not much here, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I said I'm just lookin'!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want the {29_0},
but how much is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}R-really?
But I don't have any money,
so I guess I'll pass.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}R-really?
I guess I could use my allowance
to buy it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I could afford that.
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}But I don't
have any money, so I can't
buy it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm... I don't have any money right
now, so I guess I'll pass.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I'll take it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?! That expensive?!
I'm tellin' my Dad!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I'll pass then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Never mind then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How much for the {29_0}?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
I don't have any money, so I
can't buy anything.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's enough for me today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you're the madam from the farm!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}.....Sigh......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}...................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_74}Good morning.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_76}Hey, good morning.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What're you doin' out so late
at night, ma'am?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pretty late for an old lady like you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What're you doing out at this hour?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pretty late to be out, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey ma'am, did you come to visit me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_76}Hey.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you like it here,
too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}Hey! That's one of my favorites!
Can I have it?
{41_2_1}Oh, sure.
No.
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}Woo-hoo! Thanks!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_75}{50_13_0_10}Heh heh. Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_2}Oh...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}Hey, is that for me?
{41_2_1}Oh, sure.
No.
----------x----------
It looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}Ooh, that looks good!
Can I have it? Huh, can I?
{41_2_1}Oh, sure.
No.
----------x----------
That looks pretty good...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}Eww! What IS that?
Gross!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}Get that thing out of my
face!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}It looks terrible...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}Ugh... I think I'm gonna barf!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}That doesn't look so good...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}Where'd you get somethin' like that?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When he gets a little bigger, we
can run together...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There aren't many kids around here,
so we'd better be friends.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Kate who lives next door is a
bully, so you'd better watch out.
Don't tell her I said that, though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Grow up quickly so we
can play together!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cool! A dog! I wish we had one...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That dog never gets any bigger, does it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh a cat...
I'd like to try holding it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It must be nice to be a cat...
Well, I guess they must have
problems of their own, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doin' with
that chicken?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_25}I'm a little scared of chickens...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A duck, huh?
They're cuter than chickens...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Some kinda seed?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you grow that?
You can eat that, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad always says how fresh vegetables
are good for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_25}To tell you the truth, I don't like 'em.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Milk is good for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I didn't used to like cheese at all,
but recently I've been able to eat it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cheese is good for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that butter, mister?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that butter on your farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Does butter actually taste good?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if that egg would hatch
if you kept it warm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like 'em sunny-side up myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Omelets can be pretty good...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you walk around with an egg like that
you'll end up breakin' it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can you eat that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I sometimes see those when I run.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?
Some kinda shovel?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've seen you use that
on your fields, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why are you showing me that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's pretty dirty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's pretty clean.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Something special about that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where are you goin' with that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_25}What is that?
It looks kinda scary...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You shouldn't wave that around so much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks hard to use...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've used that quite a bit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can water me, but I
don't think I'll grow...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Watering your plants?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that thing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks weird...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad always used to cut my
hair with those...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They hurt!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Woah! If you cut my hair with those,
you might cut my head clean off!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are some big clippers.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going to give me a haircut?{NextPage_1}Those look like they would hurt...
----------x----------
I don't know anything about tools.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That stone isn't very pretty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess stones come in all colors, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you dig that up over by the
waterfall?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm kinda interested in old
coins, though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty flower.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to give this a toss and
see how far it'd fly...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's Dad's old medal,
isn't it?
What're you doin' with it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad was always so proud of
that medal...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's Dad's old medal,
isn't it?
What're you doin' with it...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But that was one of Dad's mementos...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty medal, don't you think?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder why Dad got rid of it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?
Does it go around your neck?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's pretty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I train every day with
Dad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I kind of get sick of runnin'
every day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
While training the important thing
is to keep it up every day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't have any friends here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_25}I don't like that Kate next door...
But I'm not being bullied or anything...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I used to be bullied by Kate all the time.
But now... we get along pretty well...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I train every day so I can beat
Dad someday.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll beat Dad pretty soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I always used to look at Dad's back
while we ran, but today there's nobody
there... It's kinda lonely...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer in Mineral Town is
really rich. Are you rich?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer in Mineral Town is
a really nice guy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard somebody called {29_0}
grows lotsa vegetables.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer in Mineral Town
really takes good care of her animals.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer in Mineral Town spends
all her time digging in the mountains.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard {29_0} in Mineral Town has
caught all kinds of fish, but I bet
she hasn't caught the fish over here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard {29_0} in Mineral Town has
walked a whole lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer in Mineral Town
is a real good angler.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard {29_0} in Mineral Town has
really bad taste.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that somebody in
Mineral Town has three whole
cottages.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you ever heard of Mythic
Tools?
I heard they have them in Mineral Town.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}That thing you gave me
really uh, “vacuumed,” um, you know?
Anyway, I don't want any more of that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me was
pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}The {29_0} you gave me
was really good!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me
was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me seemed like
it was really good for me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}That milk you gave me
was exceptional!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}That milk you gave me
was amazing!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me
had kind of a weird taste.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't like cheese much, but the
kind you gave me was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The cheese you gave me was a little
too strong for me, I think.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I didn't really like that cheese you
gave me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}That butter was really
tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter smelled funny.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That food you gave me was pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}That fish you caught
was really good!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That fish you caught was
pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_10}That wild plant you gave me
was really tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That wild plant you gave me
was pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That thing you gave me was...
pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad said that you look like a
real farmer these days.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad said that you look like a
real farmer these days.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad said that you're good at
growing things.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad said that you're good at
growing things.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that you're a
good cook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're workin' hard on the
farm, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Workin' hard in those fields,
huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that you cook a lot
at home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess you're getting' used
to farm work, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess you're gettin' used to growing
crops, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess you're gettin' used to
cooking, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm gonna train real hard and become
a track and field star.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_2}I sometimes get tired of
runnin' every day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Recently I think I've started to
understand Dad. I'm runnin' with him.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe Dad's gettin' old.
Lately he's been skippin' his daily
jog. Maybe it's time for him to retire...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad trains every day using his
exercise machines.
I'm still too small to use them.{NextPage_49}
Mom uses 'em sometimes too, but
she's not training.
She's dieting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad wants me to be a track and field
star, but I have lots of other things
I'd like to do.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom told me that Dad looked
really cool when he was runnin'
marathons a long time ago.{NextPage_49}
My mom was a reporter workin' on the
marathon and fell in love with him...
But don't tell anybody.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess Mom's still an anchorwoman,
but her voice is pretty annoying for
somebody on TV...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_25}Kate always calls me a
crybaby, but
that's not true at all.{NextPage_49}
I only play with her 'cause she
seems so lonely.
Really...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, do you think kids have
to do what their parents say?
{41_2_1}Of course.
Not always.
----------x----------
{50_13_0_2}You and Dad are
just the same. I feel sorry for your
kid.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You really think so?
You really understand me, don't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad sure was amazing when he was younger.
His running times sure were fast.
It'll be a while before I can beat him...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess Mom and Dad plan to
keep working for a while.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come run with me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_2}Grownups are so selfish...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do female reporters get all mushy
around athletes?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope my parents will stay
healthy until I'm grown up
and married...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come and visit me again, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_2}........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I'll go find a cute little reporter
in the city myself...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish somebody would introduce me to
a good wife...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not a crybaby, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad doesn't drink, but I like to
come here occasionally.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's more to life than running.
I've got to enjoy myself more...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel great.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, wanna play a guessin' game?
I'm thinkin' of a number from 1 to 10.{NextPage_49}
And it's not 7!{NextPage_49}
{50_13_0_9}Aw, man!
Why do I always do that!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, wanna play a guessin' game?
I'm thinkin' of a number from 1 to 10.{NextPage_49}
I'm not telling you it's 3 this time!{NextPage_49}
{50_13_0_9}Aw, geez!
Why do I always do that!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wanna try liftin' a barbell?{NextPage_49}
{34_1_78}...Ha ha ha, just kidding.
They're too heavy for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, wanna play a guessin' game?
I'm thinkin' of an animal.{NextPage_49}
You'll never guess it's a c-- oops!
I almost told you it was a cow!{NextPage_49}
{50_13_0_9}Aw, man!
I did it again!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, wanna play a guessin' game?
I'm thinking of a food.{NextPage_49}
And I'm not telling you it's a tomato!{NextPage_49}
{50_13_0_9}Aw, geez!
Why do I always do that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad's hobby is
exercising.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, wanna play a guessin' game?
I'm thinking of a person.{NextPage_49}
................................{NextPage_49}
What, you think I'd tell you it's Muffy?
{50_13_0_9}Darn!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, wanna play a guessin' game?
...I'm thinking of a white fluffy monster.{NextPage_49}
................................{NextPage_49}
{50_13_0_3}Aha, you'll never guess that one!
I finally did it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}You know, I don't think I'm
very good at guessin' games...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, make yourself at home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They say there are Harvest Sprites livin'
in the woods, but nobody's ever seen 'em.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like running, but I like
just hangin' around, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's nice and cool around the
waterfall.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's really quite pleasant around
waterfall.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
At night you can see some pretty stars
over the ocean.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes a giant turtle appears
in the swamp.
I wonder where it goes to other times...?{NextPage_49}
Maybe it's swimmin' down in the swamp.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is a good season for running.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I saw somethin' strange in the north
woods. It was all white and furry...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I sometimes see some strange things
in this area.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please don't talk to me when I'm running.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad may like running, but I kind of
get sick of it sometimes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you want something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm trying to exercise here.
Go away.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My Dad always gets angry if I
get in the way of his training.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't talk to me while I'm training.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nina sometimes cooks things for me.
She's a really good cook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dr Hardy's eye is really cool, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have Dr. Hardy look me over
every once in a while.
Never hurts to get a checkup.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you come to eat Nina's
cooking too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dr Hardy may seem scary, but he's
really a nice guy.... I think...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maintaining your health is very
important for a sportsman.
I'm glad Dr Hardy is so close by.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This place has lots of strange and
fun things around.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Gustafa is a talented musician.
For some reason
he only plays outside.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Gustafa can play all these instruments...
Isn't that amazing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Coming here can really calm me down.
Stay too long and I might go nuts, though.
{34_1_78}...I'm only kidding...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Apparently these are all
musical instruments...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really envy people
who are good at music...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Kinda gives you a strange feeling...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_9}Grandma Nina went somewhere
far, far away.{NextPage_49}
I wonder if she'll ever come back?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope I can see her again sometime...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_4}I'm sorry, I'm busy right now.{NextPage_49}
I can't be a real man if I let Kate boss
around all the time.{NextPage_49}
So I've got to get stronger!
Then I won't get bullied anymore.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_4}I've got to train!
Got to get stronger!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_13_0_4}I'm sorry, I'm busy right now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, do you want to play a game?
We can have a milk drinking
contest in the kitchen.
{41_2_1}Sure.
I'll pass.
----------x----------
Rock and Grant both do milk drinking
contests, too. But I'm the fastest!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK, let's do it in the kitchen.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Aww...
Well, maybe next time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The food here is the best.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_72}Waaah! Waaah!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not crying or anything...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks.
But not right now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
