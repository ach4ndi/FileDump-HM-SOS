Ooh! Wow!
That's a {13}Blue Feather{17}, right?
You found one just for me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ooh! Wow!
That's a {13}Blue Feather{17}, right?
Could it be for me?
{41_2_0}That's right.
No it's not.
----------x----------
Oh, I see.
I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?!
You're so mean!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What? Very funny.
You're supposed to give it to your
girlfriend, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't be stupid.
You've got a girlfriend already.
You can't fool me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm very sorry, but
you and me?
I don't think so.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you trying to do?
Enough with the stupid
jokes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Listen!
I said no, didn't I?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome.{u_805a}
I'm so happy you came.
Make yourself at home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come on.
Don't talk like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're happy because I'm here, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Uh... OK, OK...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, we seem to be out of your favorite.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They may have some at the {Location_43_35_23}.
Shall I go see if I can buy some?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just wait until I get back.
Promise?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I forgot my purse.
They don't give that stuff away, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All bad, I suppose?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh really?
Then I'm glad I forget my purse.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's with the long faces?
I was wondering what you were up to.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you mind if I join you?
What were you talking about?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.............................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I shouldn't get in your way.
Take your time!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Poor {CharName_10}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, we've got ducks in our pond.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder where they could've come from?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Should we keep them?
{41_2_0}Yes, let's.
Forget it.
----------x----------
Oh, good.
We'd better think of some names for them.
What should we name the male?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh... That's too bad.
Well, you'd better set them free then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Input_128}?{32_3_232}
OK, what about the female?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Input_128} it is, then.{32_3_232}
We'd better show them the {Location_43_21_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's see, that was a Moon Trip and a
Gar Special... That comes to
367G.{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_10}Next time, it's my treat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No! Bad dog!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_0}. I was so scared.
That dog just started barking at me.{NextPage_49}
Hmm?
What do you mean, he's defending his
territory? How does he know what's his?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Eww! He marks it?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry for interrupting you.
He looked kind of mad...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a relief.{32_3_232}
{41_2_0}Are you hurt?
So what brings you here today?
----------x----------
How scary.{32_3_232}
{41_2_0}Are you hurt?
So what brings you here today?
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}I'm fine. I love animals,
believe it or not.{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_0}I also love... farms...
I have to be going now, but maybe you
could show me around next time...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really? That's nice of you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}Bye bye!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
W-what?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_26}I just...
I just needed something and...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll be seeing you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh it's you, {CharName_0}.
What are you here for?{NextPage_49}
I guess you shouldn't say that
to customers...
I broke some plates today.{NextPage_49}
Three all at once.
I'm such a klutz.
Honestly...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I always seem to make mistakes when
I do something while I'm thinking.
So I thought I'd take a break outside...
{41_2_0}Talk to her.
Go inside with her.
----------x----------
Thanks!
I feel a lot better now that
you're here!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're going to the bar, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Make yourself at home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't feel like going to the bar now.{NextPage_49}
But... Yeah... I guess I shouldn't
cause trouble for the customers...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sigh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_0}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a coincidence! I was just coming
home from the wedding of a friend I
worked with when I was a secretary.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But it wasn't much fun.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everybody wanted to know what
I was up to these days...{NextPage_49}
They all thought it was funny that I was
working in a bar in a town like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I had lived in there until just
recently, but it was like I didn't fit in
there at all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think I'm more cut out for this kind
of life, don't you?
{41_2_0}You're better off in the city.
You're better off here.
----------x----------
You just don't understand
me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do I really seem that way to you?
I like it better here.
I think I could even work on a farm!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's right! This is my home!
I want to get married and stay here
until I'm an old woman!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A strange man is following me!
I'm scared to go home.
Let me stay here today.
{41_2_0}Sure.
I'll walk you home.
----------x----------
That's a relief.
I don't know what I'd do if you said no.
I've never been so scared.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Say, isn't this the first time I've
been in your house?
Hmmm. So this is what it's like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, what a nice bed!
I guess I'll be sleeping here tonight.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Who could it be at this hour?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Eeek! What is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's going on?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Snacks?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh that's right.
I was coming here to buy some.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry. I forgot. I was so upset...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So that strange man was you, {CharName_27}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't believe this!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Wha-?!
{50_3_0_26}O-oh, yes. That's right.{u_805a}
{50_3_0_3}I did come here to buy something...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um...
I broke a glass today.
But just one.{NextPage_49}
The reason I only broke one was that
{CharName_27} sent me to your
house to buy some things.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess he realized that I can't keep
my mind on my work these days.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you don't have enough money, you can
put it on your tab. {CharName_27} doesn't mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry. I'm so silly.
I lost all track of time...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You think I'm strange?
That's not true.{NextPage_49}
There are many women who would
understand how I feel.
Goodnight, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey {CharName_0}! Over here!{NextPage_49}
Over here!
Hey!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm just not doing well these days.
I can't remember people's orders.
Maybe I'll take off for today.
{41_2_0}How about a date, then?
I'm going back to the bar.
----------x----------
A date?
No matter how I look, I don't go on dates
unless it's with my boyfriend.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you still want to go out?
{41_2_0}If it's OK with you.
I'm sorry!
----------x----------
Of course it is.
I've wanted to go out with you
for a long time!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I had fun.
I... This is the most fun I've
had since coming here.{NextPage_49}
Please take me out again sometime.
See you later.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What, did you believe me? I was kidding.
I'll go out with anyone who
invites me.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh... I thought maybe you'd take me out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's too late now...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I'll go back to work...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm just fine.
I came because I was a sort of
interested in you.{NextPage_49}
I'll be going home now, but maybe next
time you could show me around.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do I have to have a reason to come?
I guess I'll see you -- oh, wait!
I came to buy some things...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you!
You're so nice.{NextPage_49}
You're being very sweet
to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Go back inside with you?
You just don't understand
why I'm here, do you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that how you see me?
If that's the case I don't think I
could ever be with you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, I plan to stay here forever.
{50_3_0_0}If you're lucky, you might even
get to marry me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you didn't like me, I thought maybe
you'd kick me out. I've never been so
scared in my life.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I broke a glass today.
But just one.{NextPage_49}
The reason I only broke one was that
{CharName_27} sent me to your
house to buy some things.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you still like me, then I
guess that means we like
each other.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What, did you believe me? I was kidding.
I was just remembering that
{13}Blue Feather{17}...{NextPage_49}
I'll go out with anyone who
invites me.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmph...
You could be a little
nicer, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're just playing with me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, open up!
I know you're in there!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can tell you this now, but I've always
thought of you as a father.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, can I keep being your
daughter, then?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're the best, {CharName_27}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks for everything!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How did you get that, anyway?
They used to sell fake ones in the {Location_43_31_23}.{NextPage_49}
They said that girls liked them better
than designer jewelry!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Of course, I'd be very happy
to have someone like you for a
husband.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now that that's decided, there's so
much to do! You work hard, too, OK?
I'll be supporting you as best I can!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sigh... ❤❤❤❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmmm.
It's OK. You've liked me all
along, haven't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But I don't worry about that kind of
thing. After all, you gave me a
{13}Blue Feather{17}, didn't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder how you got one.
I was pretty surprised.
Sigh... ❤❤❤❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you're kidding, say so now. You can't
tell me to give back a {13}Blue Feather{17}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've been so depressed ever since
you turned me down. I guess that's
why this is so hard for me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll do the best I can.
I'm sure we'll have a very happy family,
you and I.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't really mind.
I'm used to it.{NextPage_49}
I thought I didn't want to see you again.
But I had to go and do something
stupid. Coming here...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was serious about you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Tee hee. You're cute when surprised.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, what is this?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Tee hee! Another surprised face!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was scared then, but inside
I was very happy. It was just all
so sudden. I was surprised.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's true.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to keep talking if
you don't say anything.{NextPage_49}
Say something.
Like, what are you going to do with this?
{41_2_0}Propose to her.
Take it back.
----------x----------
I'm so happy.
We'll make a very happy family.{NextPage_49}
If I'm with you, I think I can
do it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll go tell {CharName_27}.
Tell him we're getting married.{NextPage_49}
He might be a little lonely for a while
but I'm sure he'll be happy for us.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{33_0}{_c8}....................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But I was ready to answer.{NextPage_49}
I'm going home.
We're never going to talk
about this again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I didn't know you had one of those.
You didn't give it to me, after all.
How humiliating!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you know how I felt about you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I waited for so long for you to do
something. What were you doing with
this?{NextPage_49}
Or do you still plan to use it?
{41_2_0}Propose to her.
I don't plan to use it.
----------x----------
Tee hee! You're so slow!
But you made up your mind just
in time. Congratulations!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
You're not going to use it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, I suppose that's possible. There are
many people who do quite well without
marrying. You love your work, don't you?{NextPage_49}
Goodbye. I won't be coming back.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder... why I didn't take it
from you back then...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But... I really didn't understand how
you felt.
You were kind of cold to me, too...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I should have taken it, huh?
After all, I knew how I felt about you...
It's too bad...
{41_2_0}Propose to her.
Take it back.
----------x----------
Really? This time I'm going to be
honest about my feelings.
I love you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going home.
I hope we can stay friends.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry about everything...
But...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess we're both dumped now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sigh... Maybe it just wasn't meant
to be...{NextPage_49}
What do you think?
I guess I'll never have one of these, huh?
{41_2_0}Propose to her.
Take it back.
----------x----------
Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see.
I guess you're right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was very happy when you proposed.
I know I turned you down...
But maybe that was a mistake...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really didn't know you
back then.
{41_2_0}Propose to her.
Take it back.
----------x----------
Really? I'm so happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning, {CharName_0}.
Sorry to be here so early.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm? Yes, he had one.
Right, {CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, what's this?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, you're like Cupid.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What? Why?
I'm living here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you ask? I can tell.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, what does Cupid have
to say?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's wrong, {CharName_27}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What? What's that mean?
You mean to say that {CharName_0}
doesn't like me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's not true.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You were trying to surprise me,
weren't you? I'm sorry I
found it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But it's enough.
It's enough that I know
how you feel now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Could I... have this now?
{41_2_0}Propose to her.
Take it back.
----------x----------
I think you and I will have a
very happy family.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is like a bad dream...
I can't believe I ever thought
you were my boyfriend!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you serious?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What made you want to propose
to me?
I really don't understand you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll take it.
You may have just used up a
lifetime's worth of luck, buddy!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?{NextPage_49}
Oh yes, we need nicknames for each
other, now that we're married.
What should I call you, {CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Uh-oh...
I forgot to get {CharName_4} to pay her
tab again!
{41_2_0}I'll pay it.
Hahahaha!
----------x----------
What?
Really?
You're great, {CharName_0}.❤{NextPage_49}
One Moon Trip and a Gar Special come
to 367G.{NextPage_1}{50_3_0_10}
----------x----------
Hmm?
No money?
It's OK... Forget about it.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't worry about it.
You never remember when {CharName_4}
comes in, anyway.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks.
Maybe you can pay for me next time.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey! This is no laughing matter!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe you can pay for me next time.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, it's OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good evening.
Come right in.
{41_2_0}With pleasure.
I'm sorry.
----------x----------
Just my luck...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, {CharName_1}, you're
lucky to have such a nice father.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
By the way, {2d},
I really want our child to grow up
to be smart. What do you think?
{41_2_0}Good idea.
I don't think so.
----------x----------
Isn't it?
I'm glad you feel the same way!{NextPage_49}
We've got to raise this kid right!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}What?!
No! You can't get anywhere in this
world if you're not smart!{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_9}But...
{50_3_0_7}But I guess the most important thing is
that our child's healthy and happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, it's time for bed.
Come on.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh yes, {2d}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The food in the refrigerator is almost
gone. Would you mind putting some more in?
I hate going hungry.{NextPage_49}
Good night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just put {CharName_1} to bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} might be suited for
farm work. Why, today...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} went into the Tool Shed!{NextPage_0}

{50_3_0_3}Be good, {CharName_1}.{u_805a}
Wait just a little longer.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're quite a singer, {CharName_1}!!
You have to sing that for your father.{u_805c}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}!{NextPage_49}
{CharName_1} is such a good singer!
I only sang that song once!
I bet our child has talent for music!
{41_2_0}I'm sure you're right!
Isn't it a little early to tell?
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}Yes! I'm looking forward to the future!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}That's not true!
Of course our child is
talented!!{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_3}We've got to do our best to bring it out!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mm... Hmmm... Sigh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good morning. You're up early.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning, {2d}! ❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning!{u_805a} You're up early today.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's morning, {CharName_1}!
Wakey wakey!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
I'm going to go to bed.
Good night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, it's getting late.
Time for bed, {CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's no good. You have to go to get
plenty of sleep if you want to be smart.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmph! This child of yours!{NextPage_49}
All right.
I don't need a child who won't listen
to me. Goodbye, {CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There...{u_805a} What a good baby...{u_805a}
Say goodnight to Daddy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_31}This is no good!
We have to go looking for {CharName_1}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's so late!
Where could that child be?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_31}Look at the time!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}{2d}!
We have to look for {CharName_1}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}Why you... I was so worried!
Do you understand that, {CharName_1}?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}You've got to be more careful
too, {2d}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK! It's time for bed!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Go to sleep!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}!
It's time for bed!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome home.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just put {CharName_1} to bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
By the way, {CharName_1}
watches a lot of TV these days.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, do you think {CharName_1} could
be interested in farm work?{NextPage_49}
That child seemed so interested in
the farm report!
What do you think, {2d}?
{41_2_0}I bet you're right!
It's too early to tell.
----------x----------
Yep.
I bet {CharName_1}'ll be an even
better farmer than you!{u_805a}{NextPage_49}
I'm looking forward to it!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_26}You think so?{NextPage_49}
But...
But if you set a good example,
{CharName_1} will certainly like farming.{NextPage_0}

{u_805a}A necklace I got{u_805a}
{u_805a}from you...{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be good, {CharName_1}.
Wait just a little longer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well!
You're quite a singer, {CharName_1}!!{NextPage_49}
You have to sing that for
your father.{u_805c}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}!{NextPage_49}
{CharName_1} is such a
good singer!{NextPage_49}
I only sang that song once!
Our child has talent for music!
{41_2_0}I sure you're right!
Isn't it a little early to tell?
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}Yes! I'm looking forward to the future!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}That's not true!
Of course our child is
talented!!{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_3}We've got to do our best to bring it out!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}Why, {CharName_1},
are you drawing?
What are you drawing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Daddy???{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_25}You're vewy good, awen't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Look at this, {2d}!
{CharName_1} drew this picture.
What do you think it is?
{41_3_0}Flowers.
Me, of course.
Don't know.
----------x----------
You think so too?
{CharName_1} kept saying ♪Daddy♪ but...{32_4_176}{NextPage_1}But anyway, it looks very good to me!{u_805a}
{50_3_0_3}Our child has talent. I know it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Really?
If you say so.{NextPage_49}
!?
{50_3_0_3}Hey, do you think {CharName_1}
could be some kind of artistic genius?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes.
It looks like flowers to me, but...
{CharName_1} says it's ♪Daddy.♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We may not be able to see it yet...
But...{50_3_0_3} That's it! Our child is a genius!
{CharName_1} is too advanced for us!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}What are you doing, {CharName_1}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}You're working hard, aren't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
Don't you think {CharName_1} is quite
an athlete?
{41_2_0}You think so?
Fastest kid in the valley.
----------x----------
I'm sure of it.
{CharName_1} loves jumping around.
Why, our child's a future sports star!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yeah, that's right.
{50_3_0_3}We have to help bring out this talent!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
{CharName_1} loves books.{NextPage_49}
Out child's so serious about reading.
In fact, just the other day...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}{CharName_1},
are you reading a book?{NextPage_49}
What kind of book is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come on, what book is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_30}Don't ignore me!{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_1}Oh, I have to get
dinner started.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That child is reading
again...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}I know!{u_805a}
{CharName_1} will be a great
scholar!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} loves books!{u_805c}
I'm sure it's possible!
{41_2_0}I think so too.
You're the kid's mother...
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}I'm right, aren't I?
I bet my child could do it!{u_805a}
How wonderful!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}It's not because I'm {CharName_1}'s mom!
{50_3_0_3}Our child will famous scholar someday.{u_805a}
How wonderful!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}{2d}...
{CharName_7} said produce sales are down.
What's the meaning of that?!
{41_2_0}I'm sorry. I'll try harder.
Who cares about this dumb old farm!
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}Do you really mean that?!
{41_2_0}No, I'll try harder.
Sure I do!
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Please, tell me you're joking...
{41_2_0}I'm joking.
I'm serious!
----------x----------
Don't you care what happens to the farm?!
{41_2_0}Of course. I'll try harder.
Not really...
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}What do you mean, you're sorry?!
{50_3_0_9}Why you...{50_3_0_4} Snap out of it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}That's terrible!
You shouldn't joke like that!{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_9}But... whew... anyway,
I'm glad you'll try harder.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_7}--------------!{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_4}What're you thinking?!
You had me worried there for a minute!
You're terrible!{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_7}But, you will try harder, won't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_30}Wha-?!{32_5_20}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_30}What's that?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}How horrible!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}I see!
Then you should just do whatever you like!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard a pretty singing voice just now...
Was that {CharName_20}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Could it have been {CharName_1}?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}!{NextPage_49}
{CharName_1} seems to have a
talent for music.
{CharName_20} said so himself.{NextPage_49}
I think our child really likes music.
What do you think, {2d}?
{41_2_0}I think so too.
I don't think so.
----------x----------
I knew it!
I hope {CharName_1}'s dreams come
true...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But...
School is important, too...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?
But...
I never heard such a pretty voice.{NextPage_49}
I'm sure our child has musical talent.
If {CharName_1} likes music, we
must be supportive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But...
School is important, too...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if {CharName_1}
has any artistic sense.
Could our child be an artist?{NextPage_49}
What do you think, {2d}?
{41_2_0}Sure.
It's too early to tell.
----------x----------
If {CharName_21} said so, it
has to be true!
I wonder what kind of artist.{NextPage_49}
Maybe a metal sculptor like Cody?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, that's true. It's too early to say.{NextPage_49}
But if our child has an artistic sense
like {CharName_21} said, then I think
we have to be supportive..{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}W-what's going on?!
{50_3_0_9}You scared me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well of course!
You can't beat {CharName_13}.
He's much older than you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} is quite a fast runner.
{CharName_11} said so.
Could our child be an athlete?
{41_2_0}Maybe so.
Don't be silly.
----------x----------
{CharName_1} seems to like sports.
Maybe a pro athlete...{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_9}But I don't know...
An athlete? Like {CharName_11}?{NextPage_49}
{CharName_13} would be a good
training partner, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}I guess so...
{50_3_0_12}But {CharName_1} did seem to
run very well.{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_1}And like sports...
{50_3_0_9}I hope it doesn't interfere with school.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That professor said he wants
{CharName_1} to be his
assistant...{NextPage_49}
I knew my child was smart!
{CharName_1} is an academic, I know it!
What do you think, {2d}?
{41_2_0}I agree.
The kid is just curious.
----------x----------
I knew you'd think so!
A scholar!{NextPage_49}
We have to do everything we can
to help out!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But it's amazing!
{CharName_1} was personally selected!
It's an honor.{NextPage_49}
Our future scholar! How nice!
We have to work hard!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}{2d}...
{CharName_7} said produce sales are down.
What's the meaning of that?!
{41_2_0}I'm sorry. I'll try harder.
I don't want to do farm work.
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}Do you really mean that?!
{41_2_0}No, I'll try harder.
Sure I do!
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Please, tell me you're joking...
{41_2_0}I'm joking.
I'm serious!
----------x----------
Don't you care what happens to the farm?!
{41_2_0}Of course. I'll try harder.
Not really...
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}What do you mean, you're sorry?!
{50_3_0_9}Why you...{50_3_0_4} Snap out of it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}That's terrible!
You shouldn't joke like that!{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_9}But... whew... anyway,
I'm glad you'll try harder.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_7}--------------!{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_4}What're you thinking?!
You had me worried there for a minute!
You're terrible!{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_7}Our child grows older and I'd
like to remodel the house.
You'd better work hard.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_30}Wha-?!{32_5_20}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_30}What's that?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}How horrible!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}I see!
Then you should just do whatever you like!
Goodbye!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}I'm just saying these things
for your own good!{32_3_232}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}What?!!
Listen you...{32_3_232}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}What!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What were you reading?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Would you like a snack?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is it?
You're so serious...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well why don't you ask your
father, then?
I'm sure he'd be happy to teach you.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, that's true...{NextPage_49}
All right, I'll ask him for you.
You can ask him yourself when you
get the chance, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}... I wanted to talk to you about
{CharName_1}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} seems interested in
your work.{NextPage_49}
So if {CharName_1} comes and asks you, I
want you to take some time for your child.
{41_2_0}Of course.
I'm too busy.
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}Really? That's good.
There's only so much that I can do by
myself.{NextPage_49}
This kind of thing should be handled by
the child's father. I'll leave it to you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}That's no good!
That child depends on you!
Don't you know that?!{NextPage_49}
If you're really that busy, why not have
{CharName_1} help you?{52_0_0_0}
{39_1}Right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
Could I talk to you for a minute?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I kind of think {CharName_1} isn't very
interested in farm work. What do you say?
{41_2_0}Maybe not.
Of course my child's interested!
----------x----------
You think so too?{NextPage_49}
But if there's something else
{CharName_1} likes, that's fine too.
It's {CharName_1}'s life, after all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You think so?
If you say so, I guess maybe
it's true, but...{NextPage_49}
But if there's something else
{CharName_1} likes, that's fine too.
It's {CharName_1}'s life, after all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How have things been going recently?
The farm, I mean.
{41_2_0}It's going well.
Not great.
----------x----------
Really?{50_3_0_35}
{CharName_7} doesn't seem to think so...{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_9}Well, anyway, our child is
older now, so you have to work hard.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}That's no good! Snap out of it!
Our child is older now, so
you must work hard!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Music is nice, but you should help your
father out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Art is nice, but you should help your
father out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sports are nice, but you should help your
father out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Studying is nice, but you should help your
father out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know you like the farm, but you're
still young. You have to try doing lots
of things while you still can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh dear, {2d}...{50_3_0_9}
{CharName_1} isn't home yet.
And it's so late.{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_4}That kid!
Wandering around all hours of the night!
Maybe {CharName_1} with {CharName_27} again...{NextPage_49}
{2d}...
Would you mind going to check for me?
{41_2_0}Sure I'll go.
{CharName_1} is an adult now.
----------x----------
Well, that's true.
But this is too late!
OK, I'll go myself!
{41_2_0}No, I'll go.
{CharName_1} will be back soon.
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}OK then!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well!
At {CharName_27}'s place again, eh?
I'll have to go and complain later!{NextPage_49}
That kid certainly does like music.
Is our child a budding musician?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}If I don't see that kid in 41 minutes
You'll both be in trouble!
Understand?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Finally!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}What time do you think it is?!
Where were you?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}Wait just a minute!
{CharName_1}!
Of all the--!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
At {CharName_27}'s place again, eh?
I'll have to go and complain later!{NextPage_49}
That kid certainly does like music.
Is our child a budding musician?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I ask you something strange?
{41_2_0}No.
Sure.
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}What's that supposed to mean?!
You could at least listen to me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_0}Well...
Do round things ever look square?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}???
Of course not.
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}That's how I thought you'd react.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, you're right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The truth is, {CharName_1}
asked me that out of the blue.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Are you feeling OK, {CharName_1}?
Are you tired?
What are you talking about?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't understand what you mean.
Round things look round...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So that's what happened.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if our child could have an
artistic sense...{32_3_232}
I don't understand these things, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What? What is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All right.
So what should I do?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you ready?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ready... {32_1_244}Set... {32_1_244}Go!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come on {CharName_1}!!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Finished!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}How horrible!
You lost!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...{50_3_0_9}
{CharName_1} still isn't home.{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_4}It's so late. Where
could that child be!
{41_2_0}I'll go look.
{CharName_1} is an adult now.
----------x----------
Well, that's true.
But I'm still worried.
I'm going to go look.
{41_2_0}No, I'll go.
{CharName_1}'ll be back soon.
----------x----------
OK then...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_30}Well! At {CharName_19}'s place again!{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_9}Being interested in {CharName_19}'s research
is fine, but staying out at all hours...{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_1}I wonder if our child is thinking
of being a scholar.{50_3_0_3}Tee hee!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}If I don't see that kid in 41 minutes
You'll both be in trouble!
Understand?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Finally!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}What time do you think it is?!
Where were you?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}Wait just a minute!
{CharName_1}!
Of all the--!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Being interested in {CharName_19}'s research
is fine, but staying out at all hours...{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_1}I wonder if our child is thinking
of being a scholar...{50_3_0_3}Tee hee!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing there by yourself?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why?{NextPage_49}
I don't know the details, but it was
before you were born.{NextPage_49}
I believe it was in the spring.
{CharName_7} and your father came
here.{NextPage_49}
{CharName_7} had been here before, with
another man...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I only asked {CharName_7} about it once.{NextPage_49}
But that person was your father's father.
That makes him your grandfather,
you see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't really know.{NextPage_49}
I never saw him again and
{CharName_7} won't tell me
any more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He doesn't seem to want to talk about
it. He just says he's working on the farm
in honor of your grandfather's memory.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?
I'm sure your father would be happy!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You came just in time.
Go into the other room{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You came at just the right time.
Griffin is about to play a concert for us.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's not true!
You'll stay and listen, won't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Tee hee. He's starting!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I had a good time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He's so cool when he plays his guitar.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you want to listen?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...
Um, you're pretty strange, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess he understands why I've
been so distracted...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_64}Hmph! I can't believe it!
Why can't I do anything
right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh?{32_1_244} What is it?{32_1_244}
What's with the long faces?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?{32_1_244} What is it?
{41_2_0}It's nothing.
Love problems.
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}I see! {32_1_244}So I'm left out of the loop, huh?!{32_1_244}
{50_3_0_11}It's a girl, isn't it?
{50_3_0_0}All right.{32_1_244} I guess it's about time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Here it is!{32_1_244}
Who put it in a place like this?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}Really?{32_1_244} Well then...{u_805a}
No matter who it is, we're behind you!
You're my son, so I'm sure it'll go fine.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_64}What?{32_1_244} {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}Well...{32_1_244} If I know my son...
{50_3_0_1}I bet it's...{32_1_44}
Kate, isn't it?❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're worried about Hugh, aren't you?
Well, {32_1_244}that's OK.
..........{32_1_244}Worry all you like.{NextPage_49}
Figure everything out yourself.
That's how you become a real man!
{50_3_0_3}I'm not worried. You're my son, after all!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That child!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}He really is becoming a man...❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_12}He's becoming a man...I guess.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_31}Oh no!{32_1_244}
I left the food cooking!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, what are you looking at?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is it? Thinking about something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's been quite a long time...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} is all grown
up now.
And we've gotten older.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why, your hair is all white
and you're all wrinkly! Tee hee.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...What?
{41_2_0}You're wrinkly too.
You're as beautiful as ever.
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}What?! How rude! I've still got it!
{50_3_0_26}Well, maybe a little wrinkly.{NextPage_49}
I've gotten old, too. I'll have to admit.
Tee hee.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Don't you think so? Hee Tee.❤
You're being awfully nice today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But we've still got work to do.
{CharName_7} still works so hard
every day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
{2d}? What is it?{NextPage_49}
?!
{2d}! {2d}!!{NextPage_49}
{CharName_1}!!
Call {CharName_31} here
right away!!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't leave me, {2d}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's happening?!
{CharName_0}?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh... It's so...
So horrible... My world! Everything!
How could this happen?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But I think he died happy.
With his wife and child with him...
And such wonderful friends.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Griffin, could you sing something?
For my love.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you're selling something, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let me take a look.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you have anything good today?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}....
What are you selling?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, there's nothing here.
What a weirdo.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Bye, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's nothing I want in particular.
I thought there might be something good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll come back some other time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like the {29_0} but
how much is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}{34_1_132}Oh, did you give me a discount?
{50_3_0_3}You're the best, {CharName_0}.
I'll take it.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see.
OK, I'll take one.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}Hmmm...
{50_3_0_1}Yes, I suppose I'll take it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...
I guess I'll pass for now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I'll take the {29_0}...
How much is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
I hope you sell a lot of stuff.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Hmm... {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}It's nothing. Don't worry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Why don't you leave me alone?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}It's nice of you to worry, but...
Please leave me alone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}This isn't my day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}I don't feel well. My stomach is upset.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}Listen...
...Just leave me alone!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think maybe I'll go out on the town!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Oh, good morning...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}You're in a good mood so early..{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I have high blood
pressure, you know.
Being a secretary was tough.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}Oh, {CharName_0}.
Hello.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}Oh, {CharName_0}.
Done with your work already?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}When you have time, come to the {Location_43_33_23}.
I'll be waiting...❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you up to?
It's pretty late, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How are you doing?
Don't you get up early on the farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}Welcome.
Make yourself at home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you want to order, talk to
{CharName_27} at the bar.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}Enjoy yourself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}Welcome.
Make yourself comfortable.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you want to order, talk to
{CharName_27} at the bar.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You need to rest if you want to work!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_0}.
You still up at this hour?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't seem to sleep today...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just thought I'd stop by.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}Ooh! That looks good.❤
I just love that kind of thing.
{41_2_0}It's yours.
Oh really?
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}Really?
{34_1_132}You're sweet, {CharName_0}.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_26}Is it OK?
You sure your wife won't mind?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}....................{50_3_0_26} Goodbye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks good.
You should let your wife taste it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}How nice!❤
I love that type of thing.{NextPage_49}
Anyone who got that kind of
present from you would be
a very happy girl!
{41_2_0}It's yours.
You think so?
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}How nice!❤
I love that type of thing.{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_26}I bet it's for your wife.
I'm so jealous!
{41_2_0}It's for you, {CharName_3}.
Really?
----------x----------
{50_3_0_26}Um...
Is it really OK?
{34_1_133}I really appreciate it.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_26}Is it OK?
Will your wife mind?
Thanks. I appreciate it. ❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}................{50_3_0_26}Well, yes.
I do.
Well, see you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}How nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How nice.
You'd better take that home
to your wife.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Ewww! What is that?
{50_3_0_7}I'm sorry, I...
I just can't stand that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_7}I really mean it!
Stop it!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}What is that, anyway?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Get that away from me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}{34_1_132}How cute!
It's me, aunt {CharName_3}!❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You must have looked just like this when
you were young.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_26}Your wife must worry about
you two a lot...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}How cute!
It's me, aunt {CharName_3}!❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You must have looked just like this when
you were young.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Who'd have thought that{CharName_4}
would have a child like this...❤
I want a baby, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Eeek!{NextPage_49}
You startled me.
That's your dog,
isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}{34_1_132}Tee hee.
He's pretty cute.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}{34_1_132}Aww, a kitty cat!❤
He's purring.
How cute!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
His fur and tail are both
so cuuuuute.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh!
You startled me. A chicken, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Chickens are handy because they
lay eggs.
Is that a... female?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do any of the chickens at {24_2}Farm
lay golden eggs?
I guess that's pretty rare, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How cute!
A baby chick.
When did it hatch?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's so soft and fluffy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's chirping.
Could it be hungry?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, a duck.
Is it one of yours?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He's got kind of a likeable face.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Aw, how cute. It's still a baby?
I guess that's why it's so small.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What pretty feathers.
So shiny.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't suppose this one would turn
into a swan when it grows up?{NextPage_49}
I remember my mother reading
me that story when I was a
little girl.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?
Flower seeds or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come to think of it, we share a field with
the {Location_43_35_23}...
But I haven't been there in a long time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I always seem to forget to water
my plants...
You're amazing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a nice vegetable.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The only vegetable I can make is
salad... I just cut it up. I use dressing
I bought in the {Location_43_31_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh!
That milk looks delicious!❤
{41_2_0}Try it.
It sure does.
----------x----------
Really?
It's nice having a farm so close.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love sweet and rich milk!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Fresh milk sure is great!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese looks good.
Did you make it on your farm?
{41_2_0}Try some.
Looks good, doesn't it?
----------x----------
Really?
It's nice having a farm so close.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love all kinds of cheese.
I like to put it in salad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It must be nice to be able to make cheese.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter looks tasty.
Did you make it on your farm?
{41_2_0}Try some.
Looks good, doesn't it?
----------x----------
Really?
It's nice having a farm so close.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I put butter on everything.
I use a package a week.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet butter made with fresh
milk sure is delicious...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that going to be a chicken?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like my eggs runny.
I can't stand it when they're hard.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Eggs are great, aren't they?
You can make so many things with them.
Or so I hear.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have strong preferences about fish.
I love {25_4_116}, but I can't
stand {25_4_142}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't believe it...
That fish looked at me!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Eww...
Now I'm gonna have bad dreams...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that, grass?
Oh, one of those... wild plants, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are those in season?
What do you know...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that yourself?
Wow!❤
{41_2_0}Have her eat it.
Just show it.
----------x----------
Well, I don't know if I should...
OK, I'll have it later.
{34_1_132}Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks quite good.
Make some for me next time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love good cooks...❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?{NextPage_49}
Oh, it's a ♪Hoe.♪ I see.
You use that on the farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks a little strange.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?{NextPage_49}
Oh, it's a ♪hoe.♪ I see.
You use that on the farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That sure is a scruffy hoe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?{NextPage_49}
Oh, it's a ♪hoe.♪ I see.
You use that on the farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe's still new.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?{NextPage_49}
Oh, it's a ♪hoe.♪ I see.
You use that on the farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck at your work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?{NextPage_49}
Oh, it's a ♪hoe.♪ I see.
You use that on the farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's pretty old, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?{NextPage_49}
A sickle?
You use that on the farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a weird looking sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?{NextPage_49}
A sickle?
You use that on the farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a strange sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?{NextPage_49}
A sickle?
You use that on the farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's still pretty new.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?{NextPage_49}
A sickle?
You use that on the farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's kind of scary looking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?{NextPage_49}
A sickle?
You use that on the farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You use that to cut things, right?
Does it really work?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, what is that?
You use that to water plants?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Leave it to a pro to
know about these things.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's a watering can.
Are you growing some flowers?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry, you use that
on your farm, don't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, a watering can.
It must be hard to water every day!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like getting flowers, but I
don't like growing them{NextPage_49}
They'll be fine one day and
wilted the next...
I always feel so betrayed...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an old watering can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}Are you sure there aren't any
extra holes in that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an unusual machine.
What is it again?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, so you use that to get milk, huh?
{50_3_0_3}That's kind of funny.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an unusual machine.
What is it again?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, so you use that to get milk, huh?
{50_3_0_3}That's kind of funny.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an unusual machine.
What is it again?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, so you use that to get milk, huh?
{50_3_0_9}I don't think I want to drink
your milk unless you clean that thing...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You use that to shear sheep?
Yes, I've seen people do that.
It's what they use on toy poodles, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It must be hard to shear a
sheep.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are nice and new.
Are those clippers for shearing sheep?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But they're so cute with their
little fluffy coats...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going to shear some sheep?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But they're so cute with their
little fluffy coats...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are those clippers?
Do they still work?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It can hurt when your hair gets tangled.
Be careful when you use those.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Is that new?
How nice.
Good luck with your work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Going to work?
You're a hard worker, aren't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Keep up the good work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}That tool's seen a lot of use.
Does it still work?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I guess I shouldn't focus on appearances.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a lovely stone.
Did you dig that up yourself?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think {CharName_6} gave me one like
it once.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}Go throw that away.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}You really like that?
You're still a boy at heart, aren't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a pretty flower.
What, a present for me?
{41_3_1}That's right.
If you like it, feel free.
No.
----------x----------
{34_1_132}Well, how nice of you!
Thanks. I'll put it in my room.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?
{34_1_132}Thanks.
I love flowers.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a pretty flower.
Are you going decorate your room?
............How nice..........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a pretty flower.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, I used to listen to those
all the time when I was younger.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There was a cafe near my house
that always had the best records for
you to listen to. I went there a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did {CharName_25} give you that?
She's a good cook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Food is tastier if it has some
spices in it, don't you think?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}What an odd sound. So primitive{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}That's a strange drum.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, did you come in first place
at something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty medal.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's nice... but it's a little scary.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's not my style.
When would you wear something like that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sheet music?
It looks difficult.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I may not look it, but I've taken voice
lessons and can read music.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, that is something
interesting there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He tried to give me one, too, but
I refused.
I told him to light one for me instead.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, how nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, that's nice.
As long as you like it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Farm work must be tough.
But a man working in the
fields sure is attractive...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes I get to like people just
because of one part of their personality.
Maybe that's why my luck isn't so hot...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like it in {Location_43_30_23},
but I sure miss cherry pies and bowling.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wasn't very good at bowling, but
I used to have fun betting with my
friends over the results.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I used to like people who seemed
heroic.{NextPage_49}
But the heroes in movies usually
aren't very nice people,
I guess.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Men just have to be strong when
it counts.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, the {29_0} you
gave me a while ago was very
tasty.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}This is hard to say...
But I don't really like {29_0}.
But it was nice of you to give it to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}That cheese was delicious.❤
I shared it with {CharName_27}
at the bar.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese smelled a little funny.
I only need a bit of that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese was delicious.❤{NextPage_49}
It's pretty rare, so of course
I didn't give any to
{CharName_27}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Thanks for that cheese.
{CharName_27} thought it was
good too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}That butter was rich
and very tasty.
I'd love some more.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}That butter had a kind of... odor.
It was too strong for everything I
tried with it. I'm sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}That butter was good.
You can't make much of that, can you?
It was very nice of you to share it.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Thanks for the butter.
It was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}The {29_0} you made
was delicious.❤{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_0}I know I'd be happy if I
were your wife.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Thanks for the {29_0}.
You seem to like cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You must like your farm.
It's amazing how much you put into it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everyone says your cooking
is so good.
Maybe you can teach me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh...
What are you doing here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}Did you need something?
What is it?
{41_3_0}I came to talk.
I wanted to see your pretty face.
I thought of a funny joke.
----------x----------
With me?
{50_3_0_10}{34_1_132}I love talking to
you, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My face?
{34_1_132}Tee hee.
It's the same as yesterday, silly.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well then, maybe you should tell it
to the kid across the way?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks for coming.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome.
Make yourself comfortable.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Yes?
Did you need me for something?
{41_3_0}I'm tired from work.
I have something funny to tell you.
How are you?
----------x----------
{50_3_0_26}That's too bad. Take a rest.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, what is it?
{50_3_0_10}{34_1_132}You're a fun guy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_31}I'm fine.{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_26}What's gotten into
you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you're tired, the {Location_128_11_128}{_2f}ue Bar{17} is
the best.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just don't drink too much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you come here to see me?
Or Griffin?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You came to see me?
What is it?
{41_3_0}I wanted to see your face.
I wanted to talk.
Nothing in particular.
----------x----------
{50_3_0_26}My!
You're going to make me
blush!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh?
Do we have to talk about it here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...
Well, then I should be going.
I have a lot of things to think about.{NextPage_49}
Could you leave me alone?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks for coming.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is it?
Did something bad happen at work?
{41_3_0}Yes.
No.
Something good happened.
----------x----------
{50_3_0_26}Oh, that's too bad.
You can forget your troubles here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, that's good.
I've had all sorts of things happen...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's good.
Your work looks like fun.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come to the bar whenever you're
tired from work.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}It sure is warm.
It's nice and refreshing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_133}It's the season of love, isn't it?
That's so exciting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The flowers blooming around here sure
are pretty. I'm getting all emotional...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel so free.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I should take some lessons or
something... But it's so far to town.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want to lose weight by summer!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_133}It's so hot.
I feel faint.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess it's more comfortable here
than in other places.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_133}I always get romantic ideas on hot
summer nights.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_133}I don't suppose you'd be interested in
a passionate romance?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The beach is great at this time of year!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's not bad here, but I always feel
on my guard when I go to other towns.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's cooler, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}There are lots of good foods at this
time of year. I hope I don't get fat!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel like taking a nap.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I sleep well these days. It's not hot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}If you make something good on your farm,
be sure to give me some!❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}I can't seem to concentrate.
Maybe I'll go shopping or something.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It sure is cold.
I'd like to eat something hot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}I may dress skimpily, but I actually
have poor circulation. I'm freezing!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hate wearing thick winter clothes.
They're just not stylish.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel so alone at this time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_133}It's chilly at this time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I'll make something hot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Drink a lot when you're tired.
You'll feel better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The drinks here are all Griffin originals.
You can't get them anywhere else.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can sometimes hear Griffin play
his guitar. Well, just sometimes...
You might hear it if you stop by often.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}Don't be shy.
Drink up. But not too much,
OK?❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I try not to worry about tomorrow.
After all, you never know what's going
to happen, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I sometimes miss life in the
city...
But it's not like I'm unhappy here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Chris knows all about the latest trends
in the {Location_128_38_128}{2c_128_55}y{17}, so I like talking to her.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is the most contemporary part of
{Location_128_15_128}{32_128_53}get-Me-Not Valley.{17}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I come here and take deep breaths
I feel like I can get rid of all of the
bad feelings in my body.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}I bet it would feel good to swim
in the waterfall.
How about doing it together, {CharName_0}?
{41_2_0}By all means!
Give me a break.
----------x----------
{50_3_0_26}My! I was just kidding...
{50_3_0_4}What kind of a girl
do you think I am?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I was just kidding.
Gee, you don't seem to have much of
a sense of humor...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I was just kidding!
If I tried something like that at my age
I'd probably drown.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}There's lots of natural beauty around
here, so its good when you need a break.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_0}I think it gives off negatively charged
ions or something...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}I always feel better when I come here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_0}...❤
Did you come here to
find me?
{41_2_0}That's right.
It's just a coincidence.
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Well!❤ How nice!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}Oh, is that all?
I thought for sure that you had come
looking for me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}Have you ever heard that women
are more attractive when they're in love?❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}Isn't love great?❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_26}{34_1_133}Ahh!
I feel so good just being here...{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_0}.
Are you taking a break?
{41_2_0}That's right.
I just saw you, so...
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}Tee hee. Me too.
I love it here.
It's so relaxing.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_0}Wha--
{50_3_0_2}Oh, {CharName_0}...
I bet you say that to all the girls.{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_3}Well, it's OK.
I like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It sure feels good here, doesn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is your store closed for the day?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But there's something I want...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_5}I'm sorry, but I don't want to
talk with you. If you keep talking to me
I might just explode.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_5}What!!!
This is the first time something like
this happened to me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_6}You monster!!
Go away!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}{34_1_132}Hi.❤
{CharName_0}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Are we going to buy a queen sized bed when
we get married? Oh, I want silk sheets!
{34_1_133}Aren't they great?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
To tell you the truth, I'd like to
stay with you right now.
I'm so lonely by myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}We have to have kids.
I think it'll help our marriage.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you surprised me.
A date?
You must be kidding.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm so bored. Let's talk
about something interesting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}{34_1_132}Hi.❤
Darling...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't make me worry.
Not even once...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Most of the people around here don't
seem to know about us yet.{NextPage_49}
I still get asked out on a lot
of dates.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}{34_1_132}Let's go out again.
No matter where we go around here
we end up meeting someone we know, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}I can't believe you!
How can you come and talk to me like
there's nothing wrong?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}It's too late now.
I never give men a
second chance.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't want to talk now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It raining...
I feel so depressed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm thirsty...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish it would stop raining.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral
Town has a dog that won
lots of dog disk catching contests.{NextPage_1}Aren't dogs cute?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral
Town has a horse that won
lots of races.{NextPage_1}I love horses' manes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral
Town won lots of chicken
festivals.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral
Town won lots of cow
festivals.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral
Town won lots of sheep
festivals.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's so nice of you!
But I'm a little busy right now.
I'm sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe later, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I'll go to bed soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's my bed time now, so
could you be going?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to be leaving soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going out now, so if you don't
mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um. BYE. See you later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}{CharName_1}{u_805a}
Have your Dad wash you
real well!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}You're all clean!❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_5}Oh just give him a bath!
Honestly!!{NextPage_0}

----------x----------
Oh, it's you, {CharName_0}.
Would you mind listening to me
for a bit?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I got dumped.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He was from the city, but...{32_3_232}
{50_3_0_7}He was cheating on me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This always happens to me.{NextPage_1}I can never find someone that
wants a serious relationship.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh where is my Mr. Right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Oh well.{NextPage_1}There are plenty more fish in the sea.
I can't give up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Thank you. I feel better
now that I've talked about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}There aren't many I can say these
kinds of things to here.{NextPage_1}I hope you'll let me do this again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He said that he loved the other girl more
than me.
He didn't even hesitate.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I struck out again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He was from the city, but...{32_3_232}
{50_3_0_7}He was already married.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
After I started talking with him, I
realized that he had a ring on his finger.
I was so embarrassed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why are all the good men taken? Why can't
I find someone?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't there someone out there for me?{NextPage_1}I just want someone to love me. Only me.
Is it that difficult for me to find a man
to love me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've got to find somebody nice like
you did.
Let's talk again sometime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I've got to find someone else now...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He was from the city and he was younger
than me. It was going so well.
But...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
As soon as I told him how old I was,
I never heard from him again...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He must have thought that we were
the same age.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A lot of men like younger women.{NextPage_1}I wish they wouldn't worry about that and
look at me for who I am.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What should I do?
Men are so selfish.{NextPage_1}They have women on the side, but get all
jealous of our male friends...{NextPage_1}They won't look at you if you're over 41.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's talk again sometime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This time he was an older man,
and very dependable.
He was so nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I started thinking about getting
married.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So I casually brought up the subject
of marriage.{NextPage_1}But he said he liked things as they were.
I thought maybe things would be OK if we
let them stay as they were, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
One day when I was with him, we happened
to run into one of his friends.{NextPage_1}He introduced me to him as his friend.{NextPage_1}Not his girlfriend.{NextPage_1}What about all the meals we ate together,
or the movies we went to see?
Didn't that mean anything?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I wasn't really dumped.{NextPage_1}I was never his girlfriend at all.
Just someone to have fun with.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm so tired.
I'm sick of men.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Griffin, what is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_0}I'm fine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Yes.
Somehow, looking at your face
cheered me up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}It doesn't mean anything.
Come on, let's go home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}{CharName_0},
thanks for everything.
Bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}Enough!
You're acting like a baby!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}This is about your future, you know!
Girls who can cook are much more likely
to find a husband!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}{2d}!
Our child's going to be single for the
rest of her life! Say something!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}What's wrong with her all of a sudden?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Hmm?
She's rebelling?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I did it again.
I know I shouldn't but I got mad again...
I'll have to be more careful.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whaaaaaaaaaaaat?!!
Just kidding. I knew about it all along.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And I bet it's Hugh, right.
That's my girl.
You're a good judge of men, like me!{NextPage_49}
Are you going out yet?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's no good.
Kate will sink her claws into
Hugh in no time flat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't think like that!
If it's love, you can't let anything
stand in your way!{NextPage_49}
Fight, fight, fight!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning, {CharName_0}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did I surprise you, coming like this?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have something to tell you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Recently Griffin...
Well, he seems to have noticed how
I was feeling, and... Well...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've really grown to like
you.
What do you think about me?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Propose to her.
I'm sorry!
----------x----------
You're sure?
You can't take it back later!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll work hard to be a good wife!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I've made a fool of myself!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm leaving!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
I'm sorry for coming like this...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's been a year since you came here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Haven't you noticed how I feel about you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please tell me how you feel.{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Propose to her.
I don't know what you're talking about.
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, I'm so happy!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We'll be so happy together!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're terrible!
You've just been teasing me, haven't you!
Leading me on!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sayonara, buddy!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
