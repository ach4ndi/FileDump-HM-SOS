\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136That was some storm\u2328yesterday, wasn't it?
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136How's it going there?
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136How's it going there?
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136How's it going there?
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136Well how about that?\u2328What a cute animal.
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136I'd...really rather not be\u2328this close to that animal.\u2328I just don't like it.
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136How's it going there?
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136You'll want to give that\u2328feather to your sweetheart.\u2328
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136Well now...a present?\u2328That's so kind of you,\u2328but I can't accept it.
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136Hmm, another gift?\u2328Oh, I couldn't accept\u2328anything else today.
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136How's it going there?
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136How's it going there?
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136That's most definitely\u2328something you should hold\u2328onto.
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136Oh! \u206dOkara\u206c!\u2328For my birthday?\u232b\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136This is my absolute\u2328favorite! How thoughtful.
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136Oh! \u206dOkara\u206c!\u2328For me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136This is my absolute\u2328favorite! How thoughtful.
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136How's it going there?
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136How's it going there?
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136Oh, a birthday present?\u232b\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136And such a nice gift, too.\u2328You're very thoughtful,\u2328\u232a.
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136Oh, for me?\u2328And such a nice gift, too.\u2328You're very thoughtful.
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136A present for me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136Didn't know you knew my\u2328birthday.\u2328This is very nice.
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136A present for me?\u2328Well, thank you very much.
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136This is meant to be a gift?\u232bI was hoping for something\u2328a little better than this\u2328for my birthday.
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136That's for me?\u232bI can't say I'm very\u2328grateful for this, but I'll\u2328take it anyway.
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136That's for me? I can only\u2328think that this is some\u2328sort of prank. 
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136How's it going there?
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136How's it going there?
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136How's married life,\u2328\u232a?\u232b\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136I know it takes work\u2328sometimes, but there's\u2328nothing more rewarding.
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136It's dreadfully windy today!\u2328What are you doing out in\u2328weather like this!?
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136You ought to be inside\u2328during a blizzard like\u2328this. You've got gumption!
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136I don't know how this town\u2328would get along without you,\u2328\u232a.\u232b\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136You're such a hard worker.\u2328You know, you remind me of\u2328myself a little bit.
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136You're a very good influence\u2328on the town, \u232a.\u2328\u232bYou really run a fine farm.
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136It's always so nice to see\u2328you, \u232a.\u232bAnd I know Rose has taken a\u2328fancy to you too, so you\u2328come on over any time.
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136How's the work going,\u2328\u232a?\u232bI know you're busy, but Rose\u2328loves it when you stop by\u2328to see us.
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136How are things going?\u2328Running a farm can be\u2328awfully difficult.
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136How's your farm going?\u2328Are you getting the hang\u2328of things?
\u1f46\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136Being the mayor isn't as\u2328easy as it looks, you know.
