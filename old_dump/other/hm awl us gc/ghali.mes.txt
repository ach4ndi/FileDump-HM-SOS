I can't believe
it...{CharName_0}...{NextPage_49}
To think that you
would die before
me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, play
a song in memory of
{CharName_0}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}Hello there.
Mind if I stop in?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}......
Just dropping in... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{CharName_0},
can you help me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}......
Hello...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}Looks like you're
all sold out.
That's too bad. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}......
Looks like you're
all sold out. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}Can't be helped.
Guess I'll come
back another time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_7}I can't believe
there's nothing
left... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}Don't pay me no
mind, I'm just
taking a look. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_7}......
Huh...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}Hmmm...
Do you have anything
else...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_7}...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry, but I'm
done for now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Who are you?
Oh, I remember you,
{CharName_0}.{NextPage_49}
I used to live in
the town, but after
I got older I came {NextPage_1}out here with Nina
to get some rest and
relaxation. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Who are you?
Oh, I remember you. {NextPage_49}
Don't concern
yourself with me
too much... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_7}......... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_7}......
......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_7}Just leave me alone
for now... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_7}......
Would you just leave
me alone for now...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_4}......
What do you want! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_4}......! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_4}This better be
something important
to bother me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_4}......
Just get outta here! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}Hey, good morning
to you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......
Oh, if it isn't
you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}Hey, good
afternoon to you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}Hey, good evening
to you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}Hey, good evening
to you. {NextPage_49}
But what are you
doing out at night? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}Oh, {CharName_0}.
What are you doing
out so late at night?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}Oh, {CharName_0}.
Thanks for coming.
Take it easy okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}What are you up to
in the middle of
the night? {NextPage_49}
Not like I should
talk but... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}Oh, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_49}
It's really a total
coincidence to
meet you here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_3}Oh, you brought
that for me?
It's my favorite.
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_3}Thanks a bunch.
I can't wait to
eat this later... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_9}So that's how
it is... {NextPage_1}Can't be helped... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}Did you get that
for me? {NextPage_49}
I'm grateful but I'm
okay for now... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}I used to eat this
with my wife when
we were younger...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}You've got something
good there...
I'm jealous. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got something
good there. {NextPage_49}
I'm sure it has
nothing to do with
me now but... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}That's really my
weakness...
No doubt about it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_4}I'm not interested
in anything now... {NextPage_49}
Just leave me alone,
would you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_9}A guy my age can't
eat things like
that... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_9}No matter how many
times you show me,
it's still the same. {NextPage_49}
Cough, cough...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_9}What is that I
wonder... {NextPage_49}
I don't think I
really want to know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}No matter how much
I look at it, I
still don't like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_3}Oh, he's very
cute. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_10}Children are always
so cute. {NextPage_49}
I have grandchildren
myself... {NextPage_49}
They're all
grown now though... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_10}Oh, this is...
such a cute dog.
He just melts me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_10}Maybe I should keep
a pet at home too? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_9}......
What kind of seed
is that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}Do your best to
grow really
great crops...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}Ho ho.
You got this from
your farm didn't you.{NextPage_49}
It looks really
fresh. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}It looks like it
will do my body
good... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}That's a very tasty
looking dish. {NextPage_49}
{50_17_0_10}Oh, it's for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}It looks so good,
I don't think it
will be enough. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_9}Is this a good hoe?
Those kind of things
are lost on me... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}Are you going to do
some field work
from here on? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}The more you use it,
the easier it will
become to use. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_9}Is this a good
sickle? {NextPage_49}
Those kind of things
are lost on me... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_9}It's common sense
not to go spinning
that around. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_10}That's seems to be
a good watering can. {NextPage_49}
I'm sure the trees
and plants will
appreciate it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_9}Yet, it has such a
strange shape. {NextPage_49}
Is it a rare item
or something? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a new
watering can. {NextPage_49}
Are you planning on
growing bonsai
as well? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}The world of bonsai
growing is deep, but
don't worry. {NextPage_49}
I'll teach you
everything from
square one. {NextPage_49}
Oh, it's not for
bonsai...? {NextPage_49}
That watering
can is going to
waste then... {NextPage_49}
You should start
growing bonsai. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}That watering can
has been used a lot. {NextPage_49}
Still, it's nothing
compare to how long
I've had mine. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}How about it?
Do you want to start
growing bonsai? {NextPage_1}Or, are you already
growing one of your
own in secret? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_10}That's really been
used a lot. {NextPage_49}
This would give my
own watering can
competition. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_10}That's a really old
watering can, but it
looks easy to use. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_9}What in the world
is that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}It's for milking?
I'd have never
thought of that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_9}Those shears are
dangerous, so keep
them away from me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_9}They're not
dangerous? {NextPage_49}
Well, that's okay
I guess... {NextPage_49}
Still a blade is
a blade, and you
can never be too {NextPage_1}careful around
bladed tools. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}New tools are always
hard to use until
they're broken in. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}If you have tools
that have been
around as long as I, {NextPage_1}then they'll be
very easy to use
I'm sure. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}It seems like it
was used a little. {NextPage_49}
So, was I right
when I said that
age makes them {NextPage_1}much easier to
handle? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}If you use your
tools well, your
work will get {NextPage_1}easier, and you'll
make more progress. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_10}It's really been
used for a long,
long time. {NextPage_49}
It's just like my
own tools now... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_10}That's been used
a great deal. {NextPage_49}
It must be very
easy to use now... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_9}I'm not interested
in stones at all... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_9}Sorry, I have no
idea about stones. {NextPage_49}
It does look like
a stone from here
though... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_10}Ohhh...
That's amazing... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_9}Where did you
get that from? {NextPage_49}
That's very
eccentric... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are plants
taken from around
here... {NextPage_49}
I heard they have
special properties. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_9}I've never eaten
them before, so I
don't know. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_9}What's that?
A black cracker? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}What are you going
to do with such
a big cracker?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_9}What's that?
Some kind of
ingredient? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}If you use that,
you're sure to make
some good food. {NextPage_49}
Don't forget to
bring me some okay?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}That's a strange
sound... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}{34_1_94}That makes such an
interesting sound. {NextPage_49}
Where did you get
such a thing? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_9}What kind of medal
is that? {NextPage_49}
I think I've seen
it around somewhere. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}I don't really get
why people like
medals and such. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}A necklace?
Jewelry is not my
hobby. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}It might look good
on Nina. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_7}It would probably
look good on Nina... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_9}I have no clue
what kind of wood
that is. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}Isn't this a score
for a musical
instrument? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_4}Hey hey hey.
What's with the
bomb? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_4}Did you say
fireworks? {NextPage_49}
Are you trying to
give me a heart
attack? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}Is that for me?
I'm glad you
thought of me, but I{NextPage_1}don't need it right
now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going to
give that to
someone? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}I used to live in
the city, but I then
I got older and came {NextPage_1}out here with Nina
for some rest and
relaxation. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}I wonder why Nina
went ahead of me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}I came out to the
valley to live a
relaxed life here {NextPage_1}in the valley
with my Nina... {NextPage_49}
But now I'm just
waiting to join
her... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}Everyday was just
like a dream... {NextPage_49}
It was so much fun,
just the two of us. {NextPage_49}
Now all I do is
wait for Nina to
come back to me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_3}The stuff you gave
me last time was
my favorite. {NextPage_49}
Thank you so much
for it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That food you have
me last time... {NextPage_49}
It was really very
delicious...
Thank you... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_9}I couldn't stand the
food you gave me
last time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_9}I'm sorry but...
the food you gave
me last time... {NextPage_49}
tasted very bad...
But thank you
anyway... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_9}The {29_0}
tasted very plain. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}The {29_0}
tasted very good. {NextPage_49}
Please bring me some
more sometime. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_3}The {29_0} was
the best. {NextPage_49}
Sorry if I troubled
you for that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_3}The {29_0} I
had last time was my
favorite food. {NextPage_49}
Thank you so much
for that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{34_1_94}I'm not sure what
kind of milk that
was, but it didn't{NextPage_1}agree with me very
well at all. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}I'm not sure what
kind of milk that
was but it did {NextPage_1}taste very so-so
to me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}I'm not sure what
kind of milk that
was but it tasted {NextPage_1}wonderful, and I
wanted to thank
you for it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_3}I don't know what
was in the milk you
gave me, but I like {NextPage_1}your style, and I
loved your milk. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{34_1_94}I don't know what
type of milk that
was but it did have {NextPage_1}a little bit of a
strong taste. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}I don't what kind
of milk I had but,
it tasted great. {NextPage_49}
It did smell a
little though. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}The cheese I had
last time was
delicious. Thanks. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}You made the cheese
I had last time
right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}I don't what kind
of butter I had but,
it tasted great. {NextPage_49}
Thanks for thinking
of me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}You made the butter
I had last time
right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_3}The {29_0} I
had last time tasted
wonderful. {NextPage_49}
Really, thanks
for thinking of me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}The dish you gave me
last time tasted
out of this world. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_3}Everyday you work
so hard. {NextPage_49}
You've become a
great farmer now.
Well done my friend.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......
You're a real hard
worker, aren't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_3}So you're really
good at growing
crops? {NextPage_49}
That's great to hear.{NextPage_49}
Please grow even
more delicious crops
in the future. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_3}So you're good at
cooking, are you? {NextPage_49}
That's great to
hear. {NextPage_49}
You can't always be
a farmer I guess. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}You've really worked
hard up to now. {NextPage_49}
You can tell that
you've improved
since you came. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......
You've really done
well for yourself. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}You seem to have
been putting your
efforts into working{NextPage_1}out in your fields
and such. {NextPage_49}
All one has to do
is look at your
hands to see that... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}Do you cook a lot
at home? {NextPage_49}
I've heard you're
quite the cook. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}You seem to have
gotten a little used
to farm life. {NextPage_49}
The real test is
from here on in. {NextPage_49}
Do your best and
work hard. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}......
The real test is
from here on in. {NextPage_49}
Do your best and
work hard. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}You seem to be
getting the hang of
growing crops. {NextPage_49}
You're young so you
still have plenty
of time. {NextPage_49}
Do your best and
work hard. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}You seem to be
getting the hang of
cooking. {NextPage_49}
You're young, so you
still have plenty
of time. {NextPage_49}
Do your best and
work hard. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}What do you think
of my bonsai? {NextPage_49}
Honestly, are you
interested in
bonsai at all?
{41_2_1}Sure I am.
Absolutely not.
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_3}So you do like
bonsai! {NextPage_49}
That's good to
know. {NextPage_49}
It's similar to how
you grow crops. {NextPage_49}
I'm sure you could
grow a great bonsai
if you wanted to. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_7}......
That's too bad... {NextPage_49}
I believe that you
might someday
be interested. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}Bonsai are great.
You can take care
of them anytime, {NextPage_1}and you can lost
in them for hours
and hours. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_10}Bonsai are great.
Fishing is good too,
but bonsai is No 1. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}I can't take care
of my bonsai when
I feel bad. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}I'm drinking.
It only looks like
medicine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}My favorite drink is
the {13}Cherry Pink{17}. {NextPage_49}
Now if only Muffy
would make it,
then it would be {NextPage_1}the most perfect
drink ever. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}Eat, drink and
be merry my friend. {NextPage_49}
Griffin will be
pleased and so
will I. {NextPage_49}
I like a man who
can hold his
drink. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}Take it easy.
Not like there's
much to do anyway! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_10}Don't you sometimes
get bored of the
valley? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_10}I feel so calm here.
Nothing can get me
riled up... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}I really like it
here. {NextPage_49}
Don't you like it
here too? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_10}This season makes me
think of when I came
here with Nina... {NextPage_49}
I remember the
flowers were
blooming prettily... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}I love this weather.
It makes me feel so
refreshed. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}Do you fish? {NextPage_49}
You can always fish,
no matter what the
season is. {NextPage_49}
Then again there's
no comparison to
growing bonsai... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}A lot of time has
passed since I first
arrived here... {NextPage_49}
This is a place of
rest and relaxation. {NextPage_49}
You should also
take it easy and
enjoy yourself. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}I feel hot.{NextPage_49}
Still, it's not
as hot as it could
be in anywhere else. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}It's so hot. {NextPage_49}
I guess this is old
age just creeping
up on me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}This is the best
time of year. {NextPage_49}
It's not hot,
not cold... {NextPage_49}
It's especially
good for us older
folks. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}This season really
refreshes me... {NextPage_49}
The leaves change to
so many beautiful
colors... {NextPage_49}
I get even more into
bonsai in this
season. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}I feel really cold.{NextPage_49}
Still, it's not as
cold as it could be
in anywhere else. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}I feel so cold. {NextPage_49}
I guess this is old
age creeping up
on me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}Nina...
We've been together
for so many years. {NextPage_49}
She was really the
best woman I've
ever known. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nina was always so
kind and warm to
people... {NextPage_49}
She was the best
woman I've ever
known. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}Nina...
She was so beautiful
when I met her. {NextPage_49}
I thought she was
the Goddess herself
before me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Long long ago,
when I first wanted
to date Nina, I {NextPage_1}really put in a
lot of effort
towards winning her. {NextPage_49}
I would try my best
to defeat all my
rivals for her. {NextPage_49}
The truth is that
I lost to them
time and again and {NextPage_1}it was Nina who
chose me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}A lot has happened
since Nina and I
were married... {NextPage_49}
I'm sure I caused
her no end of
trouble and she {NextPage_1}stayed loyal to me
till the end... {NextPage_49}
At last the day has
come when we must
be parted... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}When we first came
here, Nina told me
"No matter where you {NextPage_1}go, I'll always
follow you."{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_7}I'll have to tell
my grandchildren
in town about Nina. {NextPage_49}
I'm sure everyone
will be sad to hear
about her... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}{50_17_0_7}Up till the very end
Nina was concerned
for my well being... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}A drink?
It's nice to quietly
drink sometimes. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_7}...I wish Nina
were there when I
get home...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}Hardy loves talking
about bonsai too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}What do you think
of bonsai?
I love them. {NextPage_49}
They're cute and
you can just get
lost in them. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}Ah, I see.
You came to visit
Nina's grave. {NextPage_49}
Would you help clean
it up a little?
{41_2_1}Sure.
Nope.
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_3}Oh, well then.
Be my guest. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}Come back if you
change your mind. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_17_0_10}Nina would b happy
if you were to tend
to her grave. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}Hey, do you like
to go fishing? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}{50_17_0_10}Oh, well in that
case, take this. {NextPage_49}
This is by favorite
fishing rod. {NextPage_49}
I'm always kept
busy with my bonsai,
so I don't fish {NextPage_1}as much as I used to. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_94}I see, that's fine.
Well take this for
the time being. {NextPage_49}
It's my favorite
fishing rod. {NextPage_49}
I'm always kept
busy with my bonsai,
so I don't fish {NextPage_1}as much as I used to.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_95}It's unfortunate but
I'll have to do it
next time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I'll go
to sleep... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going t bed,
so please go home. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to
sleep now... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really need to
get going... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I need to be
going now... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See you later... {NextPage_0}
