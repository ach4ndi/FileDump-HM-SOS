\u1f41\u1fb7\u1f48\u2136I come here every week to\u2328offer my gratitude.\u232bYou see, a long time ago,\u2328when I was a treasure\u2328hunter, I fell quite ill.\u232bHowever, the Harvest Goddess\u2328appeared, and made me well\u2328again!\u232bThat's what made me want to\u2328start teaching people about\u2328the Harvest Goddess.
\u1f41\u1fb7\u1f49\u2136I'm so thankful to her!\u232bThat's why I always leave an\u2328offering here before I go.
