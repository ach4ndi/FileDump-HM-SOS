\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136I don't think we've met.\u2328I'm \u206eMikhail\u206c.\u2328Nice to meet you.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136The winds howled a fierce\u2328melody yesterday. It was\u2328thrilling to play along to.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f49\u2136Nice pet, nice pet...\u2328Aren't you cute?
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136I love most animals, but\u2328I can't bring myself to like\u2328these.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136I have heard what a blue\u2328feather means, but...\u232bWe need to go have a serious\u2328discussion about this...
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136I've heard what a blue\u2328feather means.\u2328A proposal of marriage...\u232bWhoever you're proposing to,\u2328I wish you luck.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136No thanks.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136No, you've given me quite\u2328enough gifts today. Thank\u2328you, though.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136A Harmony Day present?\u2328For me?\u232b\u1f46\u1faa\u1f4d\u2136You didn't have to do that,\u2328but I accept gratefully.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136A Harmony Day present?\u2328For me?\u232bIt seems as though it should\u2328go to someone else, but...\u2328if you're sure, I accept it.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136That's not something you\u2328should give away.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Is that \u206dboiled tofu\u206c...\u2328a birthday present for me!?\u232b\u1f46\u1faa\u1f49\u2136Thank you!!\u2328You know what my absolute\u2328favorite is...\u232bI'm moved!
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f49\u2136Wow, it's \u206dboiled tofu\u206c!\u2328I'm so happy!\u2328Thank you!!
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Could that possibly be...\u2328my birthday present...?!\u232b\u1f46\u1faa\u1f4d\u2136Thank you!!\u2328You know what my one of my\u2328favorites is...
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f49\u2136What, a present?\u2328Thank you. It's quite nice!
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Could that possibly be...\u2328my birthday present...?\u232b\u1f46\u1faa\u1f49\u2136Thank you. It's quite nice!
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136A present for me?\u2328Ah, thank you.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Could that possibly be...\u2328...my birthday present...?\u232b\u1f46\u1faa\u1f4c\u2136This...is not a good gift.\u2328Do you mind if I ask what\u2328you were thinking?
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136...A present?\u232b\u1f46\u1faa\u1f4c\u2136Hmph. It could be worse,\u2328I guess.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f4c\u2136...A present?\u2328It's...for me?\u232b\u1f46\u1faa\u1f4b\u2136Life does have its low\u2328notes... I can't imagine\u2328a worse gift than this.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136And how is married life?\u2328Harmonious?\u232bIt must be nice to have\u2328accompaniment through life\u2328like that.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136And how is married life?\u2328Harmonious?\u232bI'm in no position to say,\u2328but having a happy home\u2328must be nice.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136I love the sound of the\u2328wind and rain today.\u232bIt's nature's marvelous\u2328music...
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136On a day like this, you must\u2328keep your ears pricked up\u2328and listen to the snowfall.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136When I'm with you, so many\u2328melodies flood into my head.\u232bYour words and your\u2328expressions stimulate my\u2328emotions...in a good way.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136I have traveled to many\u2328places...but for now I\u2328am staying in Konohana.\u232bI like this village and its\u2328natural setting, and I have\u2328good friends here...
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136If you listen carefully to\u2328people talking, don't you\u2328hear music in it?\u232bI hear beautiful melodies\u2328even as you and I speak.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136To write great music, you\u2328need a great environment.\u232bAnd this is just such a\u2328harmonious environment.\u2328
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Sometimes when I am playing\u2328violin all alone, a strange\u2328feeling comes over me.\u232bEven though no one's around,\u2328I get the sense that I am\u2328conversing with someone.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136What kind of music do you\u2328like?\u232bI like music that seems to\u2328play in counterpoint with\u2328nature.\u232bCome to the Music Festival\u2328and you'll hear what I mean.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136If you listen quietly, you\u2328can hear music all around\u2328us.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Today I just can't hear that\u2328beautiful music in your\u2328voice that I usually do.\u232bYou know why I'm angry.
\u2332 ...I'm sorry.\u2328 Somebody's grumpy.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136No, it's all right.\u2328I forgive you.\u2328Don't worry about it.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136That's not the issue!
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136What terrible weather\u2328yesterday. I'm glad you\u2328weren't harmed.\u232bYou know, those violent\u2328winds actually inspired me\u2328with a good rhythm.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Ah, a gift for Harmony Day?\u2328I am such a fortunate\u2328husband.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Is that...\u2328...my birthday present...?!\u232b\u1f46\u1faa\u1f49\u2136Thank you!!\u2328You remembered my\u2328favorite!\u232bI'm moved!
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Oh, a present?\u232b\u1f46\u1faa\u1f49\u2136Thank you!\u2328This is wonderful!
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136\u2391, why don't we go\u2328somewhere the birds are\u2328singing and talk?
\u2332 That sounds nice.\u2328 I'll pass for today.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f4c\u2136Oh really?\u2328Well, some other time when\u2328you feel like it, then...
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Is that...\u2328...my birthday present...?\u232b\u1f46\u1faa\u1f4c\u2136I appreciate the sentiment,\u2328but could you at least\u2328remember what I like?
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136And that's...for me?\u232b\u1f46\u1faa\u1f4c\u2136Thank you...but...\u2328Shouldn't you remember what\u2328I like by now?
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136I can't believe I'm going\u2328to be a father!
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136I'm going to play good music\u2328for our child to help\u2328its mind develop.\u232bAnd of course, music\u2328appreciation is important.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Soon I will be a father...\u2328It hardly seems real...
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f49\u2136Today your voice is again\u2328a beautiful melody playing\u2328on my heartstrings.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Being able to talk with you\u2328every day is a source of\u2328endless musical inspiration.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136At night, your voice is like\u2328a serenade to my heart.\u232bThis is my favorite time of\u2328the day.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136In times past, I traveled to\u2328many places, but now I have\u2328put down roots like this...\u232bThis settled life has its\u2328own appeal, I now realize.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136\u2391, would you like\u2328to do some singing?\u232bPerhaps you and I could\u2328perform together sometime.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Because you work so hard to\u2328support us, I can focus on\u2328my music.\u232bThank you for that.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136\u2391, do you like to\u2328spend time with me?\u232bIf you are happy, then I\u2328am happy.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136It seems that we don't talk\u2328as much as we used to.\u232bA husband and wife should\u2328live in harmony.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136\u2391, you've changed\u2328somehow since we got\u2328married...\u232bThe magic seems to be gone\u2328from our relationship.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136I don't feel like talking to\u2328you today.
\u2332 I'm so sorry!\u2328 Fine by me.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Okay, I understand.\u2328Now I feel better about it,\u2328so don't worry.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f4b\u2136.........Rrrrrright.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Don't you need to hold on\u2328to that?
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Is this your pet?\u2328How cute!
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f49\u2136Nice little guy...\u2328Animals make me feel\u2328so peaceful.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f4c\u2136I like most animals, but\u2328this kind...not so much.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Haven't I seen one of these?\u2328It's a cute one.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Now that's a nice outfit.\u2328You have good fashion sense.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Would you like to go on a\u2328date with me?
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136So, \u232a, why don't we\u2328go for a walk together?
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136So, \u232a, why don't we\u2328have a chat?
\u2332 Okay, I'd like that.\u2328 Um, not today...
\u2332 Yeah. Sounds nice.\u2328 Now's not a good time...
\u2332 Yes, let's chat.\u2328 Maybe another time?
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136I understand.\u2328Another time, maybe...
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Not a good time?\u2328Of course, of course.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Another time?\u2328Okay, I guess.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136What a pretty flower.\u2328A Flower Day present...?\u2328Thank you.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136What a pretty flower.\u2328A Flower Day present...?\u232bIt's always nice to get\u2328flowers from my wife.\u2328I feel so happy.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Tomorrow is the Starry Night\u2328Festival. If you don't have\u2328any plans, we could go.
\u2332 Yeah! Sounds great!\u2328 I'm sorry, but...
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f49\u2136It's decided, then.\u2328I'll look forward to\u2328tomorrow.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136I see.\u2328I'll find somebody else to\u2328go with, then.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f49\u2136I know tomorrow's Starry\u2328Night Festival will be fun\u2328since I'm going with you.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f49\u2136What beautiful wrapping.\u2328May I open it?\u232bWhat's inside?
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136When you speak, your words\u2328are like a beautiful melody\u2328plucking my heartstrings...\u232bSometimes the melody is\u2328gentle, sometimes fierce...\u2328
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Did you enjoy today's Music\u2328Festival?\u232bI loved playing. I felt\u2328entirely in touch with the\u2328melody.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f49\u2136The Music Festival today was\u2328fun.\u232bYou could tell that everyone\u2328was having a good time.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136I was really feeling the\u2328soul of the music today.\u232bI'm glad everyone enjoyed\u2328the performance.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Well, take it easy.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136As I walk along hearing the\u2328birds sing and the babbling\u2328brook, music comes to me.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136The droning of the cicadas\u2328in summer is annoying, yet\u2328it's a kind of chorus.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Listen closely...\u2328Can you hear the voices of\u2328the bugs and frogs?\u232bIt's nature's harmony.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136In winter the mountain lies\u2328in a hush...\u232bBut the stirring of the wind\u2328and the rustle of leaves is\u2328a soft whisper of song.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136I love this place.\u232bThe view from here is\u2328incredible...
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136I always hike up to the peak\u2328of the mountain when I have\u2328some free time.\u232bIt's so much fun to walk\u2328along listening to nature's\u2328own music.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136This is such a nice village.\u2328The people and nature are\u2328full of life...
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Rain is one of nature's\u2328blessings, so I let it fall\u2328on me with no umbrella.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Did you enjoy this year's\u2328Music Festival?\u232bI enjoyed playing, and I'm\u2328happy with my performance.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f49\u2136The Music Festival today was\u2328fun.\u232bYou could tell that everyone\u2328was having a good time.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f49\u2136I was really feeling the\u2328soul of the music today.\u232bI'm glad everyone enjoyed\u2328the performance.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.

\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136It's no big deal, but take\u2328it easy, okay?
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136It's no big deal, but take\u2328it easy, okay?
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136I feel like I can write\u2328some good music today.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1faa\u1f48\u2136I feel like I can write a\u2328good tune today.
