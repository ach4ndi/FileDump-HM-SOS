{50_9_0_1}Working hard?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I hope you sell a lot!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_0}Oh dear. {50_9_0_9}You don't have anything, do you?
What will your customers think?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}If you don't have anything to sell,
nobody will come to your store.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_25}Hee, hee. You're such a scatterbrain.
Opening a store with nothing to sell...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Or did you already sell everything?
{50_9_0_3}That's all right, then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Am I getting in the way of your business?{NextPage_1}I just want to look a bit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}So how is business?
{41_2_0}Pretty good.
Pretty bad.
----------x----------
{50_9_0_0}Well! {50_9_0_3}Teehee!
That's my {2d}!
Keep up the good work! ❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Oh, that's too bad.
Maybe you should open at a different time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Try not to insult the customers.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Sigh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}My body feels so heavy today...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Were you worried about me?
{50_9_0_1}Thank you. But I'll be fine.{50_9_0_9}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I'm fine.
Don't worry about me. Just do your work.
{50_9_0_9}.........................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I'll feel better soon.{50_9_0_9}................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I'm sorry for worrying you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}...What is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}...............Oh, it's nothing.
I'm not mad or anything...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}Could you just leave me alone?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}.....................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Morning, {2d}.
{50_9_0_3}I hope this will be a good day!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Good job today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Good job today, {2d}.
Are you finished with your work for today?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Aren't you going to bed?
{50_9_0_9}It's late, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}Shhhh.
{50_9_0_1}If you make too much noise,
{CharName_1}'ll wake up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Hm? Can't you sleep, {2d}?
Me neither.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Oh, hello. {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}What's gotten into you? It's late.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Oh, hello.
Do you have some business here, too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}My!
That looks just delicious!{u_805a}
{41_3_0}Give it to her.
Don't give it to her.
Sell it to her.
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}For me?
How nice!
Thank you, {2d}❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_12}Did you come just to show it to me?
{50_9_0_3}You're so strange sometimes!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}What are you talking about?!
{50_9_0_3}You sure do like playing jokes on people,
{2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}That looks just delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Oh! That looks great!
{41_3_0}Give it to her.
Don't give it to her.
Sell it to her.
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}It's for me?
{50_9_0_3}Thank you. That's very sweet of you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Well!
{50_9_0_4}You're so mean sometimes, {2d}.
{50_9_0_9}You just wanted to show it to me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}That sure does look
nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Ew! Didn't I tell you
that I hate that kind of thing?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}I told you, I can't stand that!
Get it away from me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}Get that away from me.
I don't want to look at it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}What is that?
Do you need it for some reason?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I don't like that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Please don't show me that anymore.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_7}I thought you knew I didn't like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_8}Why do you keep bringing me things
that I hate?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Well, {CharName_1}, isn't it nice
to have your Daddy hold you?{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}That child seems to get heavier every day.
{50_9_0_3}But I guess it'll build up muscle tone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Hello, {23}.
Have you had your dinner yet?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Hello, {23}.
How are you feeling?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Can he do any tricks yet?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{23}, have you learned to spin?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I bet {23} has learned to
turn a full circle by now, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Has {23} learned to jump as
high as the roof?
{50_9_0_9}Maybe that's a little too high...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Can he jump high, yet?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Have you learned to walk on two legs yet?
{50_9_0_9}Or is that too hard?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Do you think he's going to get any bigger?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I heard that there are some amazing
dogs in the city called ♪guide dogs♪ and
♪assistance dogs.♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Won't it be nice when he learns
to spin around well?{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}His face looking up at you
when you're training him is
so cute!❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{23}, if {CharName_1}
says anything bad about me,
you have my permission to bite. A little.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}It's hard to stay mad when I see
his cute little face, you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Well, you're looking cute as always.
{50_9_0_3}How are you feeling today?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Tanya is a very proud cat.
{50_9_0_9}Whenever we would feed her fish,
she would always leave the head untouched.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Cats can be unforgiving. If you bother
them too much, they'll dislike you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}That one was very mischievous
at the villa too.{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_1}Reminds me of someone...
Auntie {CharName_8}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}I wouldn't mind being
a cat.{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_9}I wonder what it feels like to spend
all day just basking in the sun?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Hello there, Miss Chicken.
How are you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Some kinds of chickens can
be very mean.
{50_9_0_3}I'm glad this one is nice and gentle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Some types of chicken have
very long tail feathers.
I read that in a book a long time ago.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Chickens can't fly, right?
So why do they have wings?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I bet the chickens think
that they'll need them for flying
someday.{NextPage_49}
That's probably why they still
have them, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}When they flap their wings while you're
holding them, it can be kind of scary.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I still can't get used to them flapping
their wings while they're being held...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}That chicken is flapping its
wings so hard that it must think
it can fly if it just tries hard enough.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Miss Chicken, your red hat goes
very well with your white feathers!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}If you take good care of female
chickens, they'll lay golden eggs, right?
{50_9_0_3}We'd better be good to them, then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Be sure to check every day
to see if they're healthy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}How cute! ❤
It's so small and fluffy!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}How are you, little chick?
Grow up big and strong, now. ❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Well hello, Mrs. Duck.
I just love your yellow boots.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}When a duck walks, its little
tail feathers are so cute! ❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Ducks can't keep their
own eggs warm, you know.
That's kind of mean of them, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_12}Is that a...{50_9_0_1} duck?
{50_9_0_3}What a big bill it has.
Grow up big and strong, now. ❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I can tell baby chicks from baby
ducks now.
Teehee!{u_805a} I'm a regular farm girl! ❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Grow up big and strong now!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_12}What kind of seed is that?
{50_9_0_3}Be sure to plant it in the right season.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}I'm looking forward to it growing up.
I love watching the flowers on our crops
appear. They're all so pretty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Be sure to give it plenty of water.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I hope it grows well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Well, did you grow that?
It looks very good to me!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I wonder what kind of flower it had?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{CharName_29} said that if you give a
crop enough fertilizer, it'll grow up
big and delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_12}Oh, whose milk is that?
{50_9_0_1}Audrey?{32_5_220}
{50_9_0_12}Did we have a cow named Audrey?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I know, I bet Audrey gave that milk!{32_5_220}
{50_9_0_12}No? I have to learn the cow's names...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}You collected that milk, right?{32_5_220}
{50_9_0_12}I'm right about that, at least, aren't I?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}The taste of milk changes depending on the
kind of cow and how they are cared for.
{50_9_0_3}{CharName_7} taught me that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}If you're good to a cow,
they'll give us lots of tasty
milk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Try not to spill any.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_0}Now I remember.
Audrey was the name of the
{50_9_0_3}dog we had at the Villa a long time ago.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_12}Are you sure we don't have a
cow named Audrey?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_12}I'm just not very good at remembering
the names of these cows...
I wonder why?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}That cheese looks delicious!
Did you make that, {2d}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}It's so nice to be able to make our
own cheese, isn't it? ❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_0}I miss the {13}{25_4_213}{17} that
{CharName_10} used to make for me...
{50_9_0_1}Oh, nothing. Just talking to myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}That smells good.
Did you make that, {2d}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}It's so nice to be able to make our
own butter, isn't it? ❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Butter makes cooking much more
rich and delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{50_9_0_1}Oh, an egg.
Was it just laid?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}We have to be grateful to our chickens.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Is that from the planet Ork?
{50_9_0_26}Just kidding. ❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey!{50_9_0_26}Tee-hee.❤
{50_9_0_1}{CharName_1} never
likes me to say that...{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Oh, a fish.
Did you catch that, {2d}? Wow!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I'd like to use it in some cooking,
but I'm terrible at cleaning fish.
I'll have to work at it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I'd like to use it in some cooking,
but I'm still terrible at cleaning fish.
{50_9_0_35}Maybe I'm not cut out for it. You think?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Do you think you could prepare
that fish, {2d}?
I'm just terrible at cleaning fish.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Aren't that fish's eyes kind of cloudy?
Fresh fish should have clear eyes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Fishing seems like such
a masculine sport. Sometimes I
feel like doing it myself, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{CharName_1} sometimes goes
fishing, I think.
{50_9_0_9}But I don't think they've had much luck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Did you find that in the {Location_43_26_23}?
It looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{Location_43_30_23} is full
of natural foods like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Wild plants can be kind of bitter,
so children don't want to eat them much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I wonder if {CharName_1} is able
to eat that kind of thing now.
That child's practically grown after all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, did you make that, {2d}?
{41_2_0}Try it!
It didn't turn out well...
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I'd be happy to.
I'll try it later when I have more time.
{50_9_0_3}Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Oh really?
{50_9_0_1}I guess we both need to study cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I've got to work on my cooking, too.
Auntie {CharName_8} will get mad at me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I've got to work on my cooking, too.
{50_9_0_9}If she heard that I'm still not used
to it, Auntie Romana would kill me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I think I'm better at cooking
than I used to be, but I don't think I'd
pass Auntie {CharName_8}'s test.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Don't tell Auntie {CharName_8} that I'm
still having trouble with cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Auntie {CharName_8}'s such a gourmet
{50_9_0_9}that I could probably work my whole life
and not be up to her standards.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_0}What a strangely-shaped hoe.
Do you think it's from another country?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}That looks really heavy.
Be careful not to hurt your back
when you use it, {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_0}Come to think of it, I think I
saw someone using a hoe like that in
one of the art books at the Villa.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Well, that's a big hoe, isn't it?
That looks like it would do a good job
tilling the soil... Or maybe not.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I hope you grow lots of nice crops.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}You don't seem to be using that hoe much.
{50_9_0_9}Be careful not to hurt yourself with it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I hope you break that hoe in soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Well, that hoe is
getting to be nicely broken in,
isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}You're working hard for me and
{CharName_1}, aren't you?
Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}My, that hoe has certainly been used a
lot! You're working hard, I can tell.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}The longer you use a tool, the more
you feel attached to it, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}It's amazing that you've been able
to use that for so long.{NextPage_49}
I'm sure the hoe must be happy to be
be used by you, {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I haven't played my piano in a while.
Maybe I'll go play...{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_1}For some reason seeing that hoe
made me miss my piano.{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_12}What an odd sickle.
Is it difficult to hold?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}That sickle looks difficult to hold, so
be careful not to hurt yourself with it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}That looks very sharp.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}That sickle is kind of big and scary-
looking. Be careful not to hurt yourself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Don't point the blade at me.
It's dangerous.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}You haven't used that sickle much.
I can tell. It's not tarnished.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}If you don't get used to that sickle
soon, you could hurt yourself. Be careful.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Oh, that's the sickle that you
use all the time, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}That sickle's pretty well broken in,
so it must be easy to use, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Wow!
That sickle is really old!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Are you sure it isn't getting dull?
Be careful with it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_12}Hmm... I think I saw that watering
can somewhere in the Villa.
{50_9_0_1}Oh, did Auntie {CharName_8} give it to you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Is that watering can easy to use?
Since Auntie {CharName_8} gave it to you,
there must be something strange about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}If something strange happens while
you're using that, just stop using it, OK?{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_4}I bet Auntie {CharName_8}
is enjoying herself thinking about
all the trouble she's caused...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Has it been raining a lot
recently? Oh, it's just that you don't
seem to be using your watering can much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}You must love it when it rains.
You don't have to water the crops then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Are you going to water the crops now?
Don't miss any.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Watering cans look kind of fun to use.
They have such a cute shape.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Well, you've certainly
used that watering can a lot.
Are you sure it doesn't leak?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_0}I guess that doesn't leak....
{50_9_0_1}It should be usable for a while longer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_12}Which do the cows prefer?
Being milked by hand or with
that thing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}If you're good at it, I would think
that the cows would prefer to be
milked by hand.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Do you think they prefer that you
use a new milker?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Is it time for milking?
Good luck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I hope you get lots of nice milk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}You've used that quite a bit.
It smells like milk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I bet even the new cows feel
comfortable with that.
It really smells like milk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_12}You use that to shear the sheep? It looks
like it should be used to cut hair...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}It must take a long time to use that.
No?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Oh, electric clippers.
I bet they're noisy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_12}If you use those on the sheep, don't
they get a little scared?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Are you going to shear the sheep now?
Be gentle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}You seem used to those clippers.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Wow, you used those
clippers for quite a long time.
{50_9_0_9}Maybe you should get some new ones?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}If they're that old, I'd be worried
about them getting clogged with wool.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Oh, you bought a new tool?
Use it carefully.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}You're working hard every day.
Keep up the good work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Oh, that's one of the tools
that you use every day, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}That looks easy to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}You've gotten a lot of use out of that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I bet a tool likes to be
used for so long.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}What a pretty stone.
It's all sparkly.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}That's very pretty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I could stare at that all day...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I really like that. I wonder if I
could make some jewelry out of it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Did you find that at {CharName_6}'s
dig site?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Auntie {CharName_8} likes that kind of thing.
She likes to hold them and imagine
the past. {50_9_0_26}It's kind of romantic, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Well, how cute.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}But don't pick too many of them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Oh, do you like that
song, {2d}?
Shall we listen to it together?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Music is an essential part of life.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Listening to music helps me relax.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Come to think of it, {CharName_14} has
a large record collection.
I wonder if he'd give you one?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}There's always nice music playing at
{CharName_27}'s bar.
I love that kind of music.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Oh, is that a spice?
{50_9_0_3}Something like that can really expand your
cooking repertoire.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I've got to find some recipes that
take advantage of that...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Oh, a {25_4_106}.
It's a simple but elegant instrument.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}{34_0_218}{32_5_220}That sound...
It seems like it could awaken something
sleeping deep in my heart. {34_0_218}{50_9_0_1}...Yes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Drums can be nice, can't they?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I like that instrument.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}A spice like that can really increase
the number of dishes you can make.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}My, a gold medal?
Did {CharName_11} give it to you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Surely you didn't beat
{CharName_11} in a race?
No, that's not possible.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I guess {CharName_11} used to be
a pretty amazing athlete, huh?
{CharName_13} told me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}How nice.
{50_9_0_4}Where did that come from anyway...?
{41_2_1}It's a present for you, {CharName_9}!
{CharName_28} gave it to me.
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Really?
{50_9_0_9}I'm sorry, I thought for
sure it belonged to some other woman...{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_26}Thank you, {2d}.
{50_9_0_9}I'll never doubt you again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}I see.
You'd better take care of it then...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}Say hello to {CharName_28} for me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I never could figure that out.
It's not a piano score anyway.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}There are 7 lines on the
musical staff.
{50_9_0_1}I can't figure out how to play it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I wonder if {CharName_20} would know?
He knows a lot about music.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}Looking at that makes me want
to play the piano again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I feel a little bad about not being
able to read that music...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_12}What is that?
{50_9_0_9}Fireworks?!
Are you sure it won't explode?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}You shouldn't carry that around.
Why don't you give it back?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Why do you have
something like that, anyway?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}What are you going to do with that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}That's yours, right?
Because I certainly don't need it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That thing you gave me was
very good, {2d}. Thank you.
You're quite a gourmet, aren't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}The dish you made was so
good, I was really surprised.
You're as good as {CharName_10}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}The dish you made was so
good that it made me a
{50_9_0_9}little jealous.{NextPage_1}You're getting to be a better cook
than I am!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}The dish you made was pretty
interesting.
Keep it up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{2d}....
Everybody says, ♪{CharName_0} is
such a good hardworking farmer.♪{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_10}I'm so happy.
I really think I made the right decision
when I married you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{2d}....
Everybody says, ♪{CharName_0} is
so good at growing crops.♪{NextPage_49}
Of course that's true.
I don't know anyone who takes better
care of his crops than you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{2d}....
I've been thinking...{NextPage_49}
I don't think I'll ever be a better cook
than you are.
You're just too good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Oh that's right. {CharName_7} said
something nice about you the other day.
He said you've become a ♪really {NextPage_1}good farmer.♪{50_9_0_10} Isn't that great?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Oh that's right.
{CharName_29} said something nice
about you the other day.{NextPage_49}
She said, ♪I can't win against that
{CharName_0}.♪
Isn't that amazing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}You really like
cooking, don't you?
Well, I'd better study up on it myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{2d}, I've been
thinking. I really think you're suited
for farm work.{NextPage_49}
You seem so happy when you're working.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{2d}...
I think you're better at growing
crops now.{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_0}I don't understand it very well, but
{50_9_0_1}you seem to work very fast.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{2d}....
You spend a lot of time in the kitchen.{NextPage_49}
Whenever I see you there, I think
{50_9_0_26}how wonderful it is to have a husband
who can cook. Tee hee.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I've got to work harder for
you and {CharName_1}. ❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I'd like {CharName_1} to
learn all of your skills,
{2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Recently I've been having trouble
relating to {CharName_1}. But as long as
you're around, everything will be fine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{CharName_1} is grown now, so we can
spend some time for just the two of us.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_26}I've got to build up my cooking
repertoire.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_26}I think you're a wonderful
father for {CharName_1}. And of
course you're a wonderful husband.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_26}{CharName_1} said,
♪I really respect Dad, you know.♪ You've
been such a good father all this time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_26}{2d}...
I want to stay with you forever. ❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I'm really happy.
With you and {CharName_1}...
{50_9_0_26}You're both two treasures to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{CharName_1}'s having a hard time right
now, but any child of yours and mine
is sure to come out fine. ❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I'm so happy that {CharName_1}
has grown into such a fine adult.
It's all thanks to you, {2d}. ❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Oh, {2d}!
Don't get the wrong idea.
I just came to talk to {CharName_27}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I'll be going home soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Housework can be pretty tiring.
{50_9_0_9}There aren't enough hours in the day...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Having more rooms means more cleaning...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I like the changes we made to the house.
It's like having a whole new house.
It makes me happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Can you understand what
{CharName_1} says?
Listen carefully.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{CharName_1} is watching us very
carefully these days.
Be careful how you act.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{CharName_1} has a lot of problems these
days. We need to be supportive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Do you think {CharName_1} wants
to take over the farm?
{CharName_1} hasn't said much to me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{CharName_1} seems to have
learned a lot of new words and
is always talking to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I wish there were kids {CharName_1}'s
age in the neighborhood... But we don't
have much choice in {Location_43_30_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I'd like to talk with {CharName_1},
but I guess {CharName_1} just wants
to be left alone now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Isn't {CharName_1} old enough
to drink with you at the {Location_43_33_23}?{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_9}I'm kind of jealous.
Of course, I don't really drink, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_0}According to Dr. Wadanda's book on child
rearing, children {CharName_1}'s
age should be shown a variety of objects.{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_1}{2d}...
I think you should also take
{CharName_1} to a variety of places.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_0}According to Dr. Wadanda's book on child
rearing, children {CharName_1}'s age
are easily influenced by their fathers.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Children slowly develop into adulthood.
{CharName_1} too... It's good, but...
{50_9_0_9}It makes me feel kind of lonely, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}It seems like {CharName_1} was
just born yesterday, doesn't it?{NextPage_49}
Children really do seem to grow
up overnight.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{2d}...
Good job today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_13}Did I remember to turn off the
kitchen faucet...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{CharName_1} will be able to help you
out with your work pretty soon.{NextPage_49}
Just try and encourage {CharName_1} to
have an interest in your work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{CharName_1} is probably thinking
about the future by now, don't you think?
That child won't talk to me, though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}You're not getting any younger,
{2d}. Don't work too hard.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I guess you can't relax too much
around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_12}Do you think I should stay at home
until {CharName_1} gets a little bigger?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Is {CharName_1}'s room clean?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Be careful going into {CharName_1}'s
room. If that child is in a bad mood
you'll be thrown out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Did you see the weather report?
The weatherman with the straw hat seems
to be the most accurate one.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}It feels so good to get out
at this time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}When the trees become greener,
{2b_30} seems stronger overall.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I wonder why I always get so sleepy
at this time of year. {50_9_0_1}Hee hee.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I always feel so cheerful in the
springtime.
It's my favorite time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}It's hot today, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}You've got to be careful when
it's this hot out, {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Sometimes when I'm just standing here
I see the most interesting animals.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}You don't think it's too hot for
{CharName_1}, do you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}It's nice and cool today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}It's hard to believe it was so hot before.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_26}I always feel so sentimental at this time
of year. Like I want to read poetry...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}That breeze feels good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Another cold day.
But I can't see my breath, so
I guess it can't be that cold.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Try not to catch cold, now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{CharName_1} is always cheerful,
no matter how cold it is.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I'd love to see the entire landscape
covered in snow, but that's not possible
here.{50_9_0_9} It just doesn't accumulate.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}If I try to play the piano on a day like
my fingers would be too cold to move.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Auntie {CharName_8} always said that
you feel the cold more as you get older,
but I'm still OK. Still young, I guess.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_0}The night breeze feels good...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}.................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_7}I've been a little worried
that maybe you regret
marrying me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_7}Do you really need
me, {2d}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_7}I'm sorry.
I'll be back after I've calmed down.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_7}..................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{2d}, good job today.❤
Have you already had your bath?
You should relax in the tub. ❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{2d}, good job today.❤
Refresh yourself with a nice hot bath. ❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I'm thinking of today's menu.
{50_9_0_9}It's so complicated now that
{CharName_1} can eat solid food.{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_1}I miss making baby food.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I'm thinking of today's menu.
I've got to try lots of things so
{CharName_1} can't be so picky!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I was just thinking about {CharName_1}.
I guess when I was that age I had
a lot of problems, too.{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_3}Now they seem silly, but at the time
my problems seemed very important.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}{u_805a}Humdedum{u_805a} Humdedum{u_805a} Lalalalalaa{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_12}If I cut up a {26_0_32} very finely,
do you think {CharName_1} would eat it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I guess having all these worries is
a part of {CharName_1}'s development.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Whew. I'm going to take a little rest.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I know {CharName_1} is in a rebellious
stage, but it still makes me sad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I've been thinking recently how fulfilling
my life is now.{NextPage_49}
Maybe it's because {CharName_1} is
growing up so well. Heehee.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_12}Maybe I should go and ask
{CharName_10} for some new recipes...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_12}Maybe I'll go and ask {CharName_25} for some good
{26_0_32} recipes...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}It's nice for children to grow up,
{50_9_0_9}but it's kind of sad, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......ZzZz.............{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmmm... hmfmmmm... ZzZz...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Snore... ZzZz... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I hope they grow up big and strong!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I thought I might study farming a bit.
I'm sorry, am I in your way?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_35}There's no problem with the soil...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}The sun gives life to so many
living things, doesn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Good soil is important for crops, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Oh, are you taking a rest here
too, {2d}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}When I come here I feel kind
of like I'm on a picnic.
I should've brought some food with me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}What's wrong with me taking a rest?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_0}I can't stand being cooped up
inside the house all day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_0}I can't stand being cooped up
inside the house all day.{NextPage_1}{CharName_1} is not speaking to me
or you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}This place always relaxes me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Oh, hello {2d}.
Good job today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}How is your work going?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I thought maybe I could help you a bit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I'm sorry if I'm in your way.
{50_9_0_1}But I just wanted to know more about
your work, {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I'm sorry if I'm in your way.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Don't worry about me.
Just go on with your work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_0}They say that a child brings its parents
closer together, right? I wonder what
{50_9_0_9}we'd do without {CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_7}..................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I guess we should be thankful that
we have {CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}If I don't come and play, I'll get rusty.
{CharName_1}'s older now, so it's
no problem.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Musical instruments can help you express
your true feelings.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}There's not much for me at home anyway...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}While I'm playing the piano, I can
forget my problems...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}{2d}, did you have some
business with Auntie {CharName_8}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}Did {CharName_10} ask you here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}I don't tell Auntie {CharName_8}
about our problems.{NextPage_49}
I'd never say ♪{CharName_0} never pays
attention to me♪ or anything like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_0}It can be nice to come here sometimes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Whenever I come here, Liz
and Tanya always welcome me back.
It's nice to be wanted...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Thank you, but I can't right now.
{50_9_0_1}I'm sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Why {2d}, you're all wet.
When you get home, why don't you take a
hot bath so you don't catch cold?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I don't mind getting wet.
{50_9_0_26}Were you worried about me? Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}I hope this rain will be good for the crops.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}When is this rain going to stop?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, isn't that
nice? ❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}{CharName_1}, you're
all clean now, aren't you?{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, why don't you
just give {CharName_1} a bath?{NextPage_0}
