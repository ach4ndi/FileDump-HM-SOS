\u2137Ahem! Welcome to Gombe's\u2328critter catching class!
\u2137Do you know that butterflies\u2328do something locusts don't?\u2328They fly!
\u2137When you're trying to catch\u2328a bug that flutters around,\u2328like a butterfly...\u232b....You won't be able to\u2328catch it just by pressing\u2328the A Button.\u232bWhen you spot a butterfly,\u2328as you get up close to it...\u232b...\u206dPush the B Button\u206c to jump\u2328in the air!\u270a BOING!\u232bWhile you're jumping, \u206dpush\u2328the A Button\u206c, and you'll\u2328catch it!\u232bIt's easier to capture them\u2328if you time your grab\u2328after your jump!
\u2137But if you don't catch it\u2328quickly, it'll get away\u2328from you! Stay sharp!\u232bBut, if it does get away\u2328from you, don't worry about\u2328it! It's a big mountain!\u232bKeep looking! You'll find a\u2328butterfly you can catch!
\u1f41\u1fbb\u1f48\u2136Ah, hello,\u2328\u232a.
\u2137This time, my request is for\u2328a \u206fSmall White\u206c...
