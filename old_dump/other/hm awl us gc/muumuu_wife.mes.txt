Hey, {2d}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Got a second? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_25}What are you trying
to sell? {NextPage_49}
You're such a
funny guy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't expect me
to buy, do you? {NextPage_49}
I thought if I saw
something nice, you
would give it to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_25}I thought I'd buy
something if nobody
else didn't...{NextPage_49}
Thank goodness
there's nothing
left. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I get it now.
You sold out? {NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_10}{34_1_132}That's wonderful!
Great job❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is this all there
is...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry, but I'm
not buying... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you're working.
How's it going?
{41_2_0}Very good.
Very bad.
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}That's really good
to hear❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you try
smiling a little
more at customers?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do your best. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I feel so depressed
about things... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I don't know why,
but I don't want to
talk to anyone. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Can you please just
leave me alone for
a little while? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Maybe I should rest
for a while...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}I don't know why,
but I feel so
agitated. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}Even I don't know
why I feel so
angry today. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}I really need to
change how I feel
right now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It was so nice when
used to be single...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}Grrr! {NextPage_1}If you're not going
to listen, then
don't talk to me! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good morning...
{2d}.{NextPage_49}
I'm so not meant to
be a morning person. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm so not meant to
be a morning person.
Yaaaawn... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't worry...
I'll be the usual
me in a second. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {2d}.
What's up? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {2d}.
Do you still have
work to do? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}Good job today. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't sleep?
{50_3_0_10}{34_1_132}I can't either... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes it's nice
to be up late. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I need my beauty
sleep, though... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't sleep?
{50_3_0_10}{34_1_132}I can't either... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_26}{34_1_133}Sometimes it's nice
to be up late. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I need my beauty
sleep, though... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How was work today? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you hungry?
Go get some food. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You want to talk?
I didn't really have
anything in mind. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You should relax
when you're at
home. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_25}We're a pretty sad
couple to be up this
late at night❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going home.
Tomorrow is another
day. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm heading home.
I'm worried about
my son... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, what are
you doing here? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}That looks yummy❤
{41_3_0}Give.
Don't give.
Sell.
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}{34_1_132}For me !?
You're so wonderful,
{2d}❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}What do you mean
you're just showing
it to me!?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're just trying
to tease me... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}That's wonderful.
I'd like that too❤
{41_3_0}Give.
Don't give.
Sell.
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}{34_1_132}Really?? For me?
I'm so happy!
You're so wonderful❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Give it to me next
time okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_5}You jerk!
Fine, I don't want
it anyway! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}That looks so yucky
tasting. {NextPage_49}
I've lost my
appetite. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I have no appetite
at all now! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not even vaguely
interested in that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}{34_1_132}Aren't you a
lucky boy, baby? {NextPage_49}
Daddy's holding you,
isn't he?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Daddy's always
giving you hugs. {NextPage_49}
He's got no time
to play with Mommy
now... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you hungry,
{23}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Make sure to wash
your hands after
petting the dog. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello...
... {_22}...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Make sure to wash
your hands after
petting the cat. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_25}You surprised me.
Don't sneak up on
me with that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My son loves
to chase chickens
around the yard. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope she'll lay
some delicious
eggs for us❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've heard that if
you take care of
your chicken while {NextPage_1}you raise it, that
it will lay golden
eggs for you, right? {NextPage_49}
Let's take good
care of her. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Make sure to wash
your hands after
petting the chicken.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So cute.
Grow up big and
strong now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't believe that
this yellow guy can
become so big... {NextPage_49}
That's quite a
transformation. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Make sure to wash
your hands after
petting the chick. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He sounds like he's
complaining about
me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Make sure to wash
your hands after
petting the duck. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It doesn't look like
he knows how to
smile... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He's so small.
Grow up big now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}{34_1_132}Hee hee hee❤ {NextPage_49}
It reminds me of how
a friend of mine
used to walk. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Make sure to wash
your hands after
petting the duck. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a seed right?
What kind is it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know much
about seeds, but
try planting it. {NextPage_49}
Let's see what
grows from it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are those our crops?
They look good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's eat it
if you're not
going to sell it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder how you
would cook that? {NextPage_49}
You probably know
better than me❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's some very
delicious looking
milk. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A milk's taste
varies on the cow it
comes from, right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sweet milk is my
favorite♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be careful no to
spill it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese looks
yummy. {NextPage_49}
{2d}, did you
make that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's have some
of that cheese
together! {NextPage_49}
Did you use good
milk when you
made it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I could eat cheese
everyday.
Keep it coming. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter looks
yummy. {NextPage_49}
{2d}, did you
make that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's have some
of that milk
together! {NextPage_49}
Did you use good
milk when you
made it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I could eat butter
everyday.
Keep it coming. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a chicken
egg?
Can we eat it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It can be either a
chick or an
omelet... {NextPage_49}
Either way I like
the yellow color
it makes... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm?
Is that fish edible?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You should cook
that yourself...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}That fish just
looked at me! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that
grass? {NextPage_49}
Oh, those are
wild grasses
from the mountain! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wild grasses are
very healthy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That dish looks
yummy. {NextPage_49}
Does it taste as
good as it looks?
{41_2_0}Try it yourself.
It does indeed.
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Really?
I'm so happy I
married you❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}Hmph!
You're just gonna
eat it yourself! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a hoe.
Planning on digging
up the ground? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your
cultivating. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a hoe.
Planning on digging
up the ground? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your
cultivating. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you like your
new hoe? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your
cultivating. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a hoe.
Planning on digging
up the ground? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your
cultivating. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You want to get
a new hoe? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your
cultivating. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a sickle.
Planning on reaping
something? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your
reaping. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a sickle.
Planning on reaping
something? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your
reaping. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you like your
new sickle? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your
reaping. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a sickle.

----------x----------
Good luck with your
reaping. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You want to get
a new sickle? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your
reaping. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going to
water something
with that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with
your watering. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you like your new
watering can? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with
your watering. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going to
water something
with that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with

----------x----------
You want to get a
new watering can? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with
your watering. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}Do you like your
new milker? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope you can get
a lot of milk
with that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a milker.
It looks like it
hurts the cow... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope you can get
a lot of milk
with that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know how
you're supposed to
use it but... {NextPage_49}
Just be gentle on
the cows with it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You want to get a
new milker? {NextPage_49}
I think you should
too... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope you can get
a lot of milk
with that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are shears.
It's amazing you can
cut hair by hand. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with
your shearing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure the sheep
will appreciate the
new shears. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with
your shearing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are sheep
shears. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with
your shearing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You want to get
new shears? {NextPage_49}
That might make it
easier for you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with
your shearing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you like your
new tools? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do your best! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What? It must be
fascinating for you,
{2d}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Sorry...
I don't understand. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}That's really
dirty looking. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well...
Do your best... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}That's a very
beautiful stone❤
Where did you
buy it from? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You say you found
it yourself? {NextPage_49}
I wonder if there
are anymore like
that... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That stone would
make a pretty
ornament. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if you
could sell that
stone for a lot? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Eeek!
What's that...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that something
expensive...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The plants around
here seem to possess
strange qualities. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are plants
from around here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}{34_1_132}That's a record.
It's wonderful! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if it's a
good song. {NextPage_49}
If it is, then we
have to dance to
it♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's some kind
of ingredient right? {NextPage_49}
You must have gotten
that from {CharName_25}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you use that,
you can make food
just as good as her. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that Wally's
medal? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty
medal. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a strange
necklace. {NextPage_49}
I bet you could get
a good price for it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Treasure that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What song is that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can you play any
instruments,
{2d}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ooh, fireworks!
Those are amazing! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}That's a little
scary. {NextPage_49}
Won't it explode and
blow up everything? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you going
to do with that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I was separated from
my parents when I
was very little. {NextPage_49}
I never saw any
other children,
just adults... {NextPage_49}
It was so boring
for me as a child. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm glad that
our son won't
ever be like that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Animals have it so
much easier. {NextPage_49}
They don't have to
hide their true
feelings. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If I compare my life
now to when I was in
the {Location_43_31_23}, I have a{NextPage_1}much higher quality
of life here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I felt as if
{Location_43_30_23}
were like the edge of{NextPage_1}the world. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are so many
fun loving people in
{Location_43_30_23}. {NextPage_49}
Don't you think so
too? {NextPage_49}
But I just didn't
like the feeling
that I escaped here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}{2d}, I think
your cooking is
delicious. {NextPage_49}
{34_1_132}You really know what
I like too❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}I ate the food that
you gave me. {NextPage_49}
It was very good,
thank you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Hey, {2d},
you're amazing... {NextPage_49}
Everyone's saying
how you've become a
great farmer. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Hey, {2d},
you're amazing... {NextPage_49}
Every says how good
the crops from
your field are. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Your cooking is
so good, {2d}❤ {NextPage_49}
You could have
your own restaurant!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wondered if you'd
be able to adapt to
farm life... {NextPage_49}
You're doing a real
good job {2d}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're growing crops
well. {NextPage_49}
You must like
growing things. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're cooking is
better than mine,
{2d}. {NextPage_49}
I've got to try
harder... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you try
harder with the
dairy products? {NextPage_49}
I'd like to eat
tastier milk
and eggs. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you try
a little harder
with your crops? {NextPage_49}
I'm sure you'll
be able to figure
it out. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really wish I
could eat someone's
yummy cooking. {NextPage_49}
Dear, why don't you
try learning how to
cook more? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I would never have
believed I'd live
like this someday. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I first met you,
I often dreamed of
being married to you{NextPage_1}in this town.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_25}It's a nice place
to live, but I was
lonely... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_25}I was beginning to
give up on ever
getting married... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_25}I'm not dissatisfied
with my life now... {NextPage_49}
But I wouldn't mind
if it were a little
more exciting... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_25}There's no reason to
be dissatisfied with
my lifestyle. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_25}It's not easy to
find the perfect
life, you know. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel so relaxed
when I come here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think you like
it here too? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's gotten nice
and warm. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Bugs came out...
I don't like
bugs...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish it could be
like this forever. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's really hot.
I don't feel like
doing anything. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My makeup gets
smeared easily when
it's this hot. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You'll get sunburned
if you're not
careful. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't feel like
eating anything. {NextPage_49}
But why don't I
get any thinner? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's gotten so nice
and cool now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel like some
music. {NextPage_49}
Maybe I'll go listen
to {CharName_27}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The weather is nice,
so my appetite
increases... {NextPage_49}
Still, I've got to
watch my weight. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Our son likes to
go show me things he
gets in the woods. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}So c-cold.
{50_3_0_2}So c-cold.
I'm really cold. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}It'd be nice if we
had some hot water
in the kitchen... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My feet have been
cold lately... {NextPage_49}
They were never
like that when I
was younger... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
wasn't in the
kitchen... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_25}I'm going to go
buy some new
dishes... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't want to
see a messy room. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Make sure you keep
an eye on your son. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if our son
has a girl he likes.{NextPage_49}
Maybe not in this
town... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what boys
his age are into
these days? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_26}Oh, {2d}.
{34_1_132}Just having a little
break❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I read the book I
bought in {Location_43_31_23}. {NextPage_49}
It was really only
a magazine but
still... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh no. {NextPage_49}
Time really flies
when you're having
fun reading. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}I'm so happy here.
{50_3_0_10}Home is where the
heart is... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was just thinking
how I now have a
family. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}This TV doesn't get
any of my favorite
shows! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My son says he'll
take care of me❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {2d}...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm glad, but I
can't really get
that right now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Next time okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Baby♪
Make sure Daddy
cleans you good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}All clean❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_5}It wouldn't hurt
you to go in the
bath with him! {NextPage_0}
