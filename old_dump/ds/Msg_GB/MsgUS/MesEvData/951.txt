\u1f40\u1fad\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eFreya\u206c\u232c\u2328Hello there.\u232bThis place is\u2328one of my favorite\u2328spots in town.\u232bOn my days off,\u2328I come here to watch the\u2328river and the windmills.\u232bHey, let's go take a closer\u2328look at the windmills\u2328together.
\u1f40\u1fad\u1f49\u2135\u232f\u206eFreya\u206c\u232c\u2328C'mon, let's go!
\u1f40\u1fad\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eFreya\u206c\u232c\u2328This place is so different\u2328from the city.\u232bTime moves differently\u2328here.\u232b\u1f40\u1fad\u1f49\u2135My mom lives in the city,\u2328but I like it\u2328here better.\u232b\u21b8I like being able to\u2328relax and just take\u2328life at my own pace.
\u1f40\u1fad\u1f4b\u2135\u232f\u206eFreya\u206c\u232c\u2328I actually messed\u2328up at work today.\u232bI know I shouldn't\u2328dwell on it, but I\u2328can't help it...
\u1f40\u1fad\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eFreya\u206c\u232c\u2328Hey, here's\u2328a question.\u232bWhen do you think\u2328this windmill was built?\u232bAll I know is that it's\u2328been here since before\u2328I got here.
\u1f41\u1fa4\u1f48\u2332 I know when it was built.\u2328 I have no idea.
\u1f40\u1fad\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eFreya\u206c\u232c\u2328Wow. You really know\u2328a lot.\u232bHm. Windmills just sit in\u2328one spot and spin\u2328forever, right?\u232b\u1f40\u1fad\u1f4b\u2135I go to work, go to\u2328the cafÂ†, go to sleep,\u2328and then go back to work.\u232b\u21be...Sigh... Sometimes I feel\u2328like I'm just spinning in\u2328the same place too.
\u1f40\u1fad\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eFreya\u206c\u232c\u2328Sorry to get all\u2328emo like this.\u232b\u1f40\u1fad\u1f49\u2135Talking about it makes\u2328me feel better, though.\u232b\u21b9I almost can't\u2328remember what I was so\u2328down about.
\u1f40\u1fad\u1f49\u2135\u232f\u206eFreya\u206c\u232c\u2328Thanks for listening.\u2328I appreciate it.\u232bYou're a really good\u2328friend, you know?

\u1f40\u1fad\u1f4b\u2135\u232f\u206eFreya\u206c\u232c\u2328I see.\u2328I don't know either.\u232bThere are lots of things\u2328I don't know, even in\u2328my own town.
\u1f40\u1fad\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eFreya\u206c\u232c\u2328Well, it's no use moping\u2328about it.\u232bI should just look it up\u2328if I want to know.
\u1f40\u1fad\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eFreya\u206c\u232c\u2328Talking to you made me\u2328feel a bit better.\u232b\u1f40\u1fad\u1f49\u2135\u21b8Thanks.\u2328I'll see you later.
