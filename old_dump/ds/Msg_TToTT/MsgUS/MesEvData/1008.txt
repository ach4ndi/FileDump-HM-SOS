\u1f41\u1faa\u1f49\u2136Thank you...\u232bHearing you say that sounds\u2328sweeter to my ears than the\u2328most divine music.\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Ever since we first met, my\u2328ears have been attuned to\u2328your voice.\u232bWhether laughing or upset...\u2328...your voice...most of all,\u2328your voice calling my name.\u232bWhenever you say my name, a\u2328new song rises within me.\u232bAt first I thought that it\u2328was just your voice that I\u2328liked.\u232bBut it was more than that...
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136At some point I realized it\u2328was not just your voice, but\u2328your presence I needed.\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f4d\u2136And so, \u232a...\u2328I accept your proposal with\u2328joy in my heart.
