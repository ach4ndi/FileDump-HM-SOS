\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f49\u2135Oh, these? These are my\u2328medical books.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f48\u2135I haven't yet learned the\u2328material in all of them.\u232bI've still got a long way to\u2328go in my studies!
\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f49\u2135Yes, it can be daunting!\u232bAt first, I could barely\u2328understand anything written\u2328in these books.
\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f48\u2135Now I can read them thanks\u2328to my studies at the medical\u2328school in the city...\u232bBut even as a child I would\u2328imitate my father by opening\u2328his medical books...\u232bI couldn't read them, but\u2328I would scribble in them!\u2328That made Father angry.
\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f48\u2135As a matter of fact, most of\u2328the books on this shelf\u2328belonged to my father.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f49\u2135My father was a doctor in\u2328the city.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f48\u2135Father became a doctor in\u2328order to help my mother,\u2328who was sickly from youth.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f49\u2135Wasn't that romantic of him?\u2328
\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f48\u2135Ever since I was a child,\u2328I've respected what my\u2328father did...\u232bI made it my goal in life to\u2328become as fine a doctor\u2328as he was.
\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2135But it appears that I will\u2328never be the doctor that\u2328he was.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2135I've been making too many\u2328errors in my work lately...\u232b\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2135I'll never amount to\u2328anything at this rate...
\u2332 Everyone makes mistakes.\u2328 Hard work will pay off.
\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2135Yes, that is true. It\u2328is too true...
\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f48\u2135A patient's life is in\u2328their doctor's hands.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f4a\u2135A mistake can be the\u2328difference between\u2328life and death.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2135So I can't just shrug off\u2328mistakes.\u232bAnd if I become a doctor who\u2328makes more mistakes than\u2328most...
\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f48\u2135Oh, forgive me!\u2328This is not what I meant\u2328to discuss with you.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f49\u2135I shouldn't keep you too\u2328late. I'm sure you have\u2328things to do.
\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f48\u2135Yes. Maybe you have a\u2328point...\u232b"Nothing worth having was\u2328ever gotten easily," Father\u2328always said.\u232bHe also said as a doctor's\u2328apprentice, he made mistakes\u2328and learned much from them.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f49\u2135If I keep trying, I can\u2328overcome these mistakes\u2328I've been making.\u232bI must not give up. I must\u2328not be dismayed. There is no\u2328time to waste on doubts!\u232bI can only overcome my\u2328mistakes through hard work\u2328and perseverance.
\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f48\u2135\u232a, you always know what\u2328to say to help me.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f4d\u2135I hope that there will be an\u2328opportunity for me to return\u2328the favor sometime.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f49\u2135It would be my greatest\u2328pleasure to be able to\u2328help you, \u232a.
\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f48\u2135Oh, forgive me!\u2328Look at the time!\u232b\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f49\u2135When I am in your company,\u2328\u232a, time seems to fly!\u232b\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f4d\u2135Well then, I must see you\u2328home before the hour grows\u2328too late. Let's go.
