Ayu{u_0086}{2d} I told you! Somebody
like you just can't go fishing!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're so mean!
I didn't do anything.{NextPage_49}
It's just that the bait was
so gross!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All the more reason why you
shouldn't be fishing!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you trying to scare me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can you fish by any chance?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yeah.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

This person's too scary to
teach me. Can you teach me
how to fish?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

You don't have to do it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh stop it.{NextPage_49}

and teach me how to fish{u_0086}{2d}
{_2e}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey! Just a minute{u_0086}{2d} Ayu!{NextPage_49}
It's not like you're so great!
You're only a pop star because
you say you are!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm no fake!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You shouldn't fight{u_0086}{2d} you two.{NextPage_0}

think is cuter?{NextPage_0}
