\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135You know the basket in front\u2328of your house that you\u2328throw items into?\u232bIf you get a "GOOD" or\u2328"GREAT", your Stamina will\u2328go up a little.\u232bYou'll be able to tell by\u2328looking at your Stamina\u2328gauge in the left corner.\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135I like cows. They're\u2328always so calm and\u2328amiable.\u232bAnimals may seem alike, but\u2328they all have distinct\u2328personalities.\u232b\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f49\u2135That's what makes them so\u2328fascinating!\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135So how do you like the\u2328bazaar? There's lots of\u2328stalls and products!\u232bEach stall offers\u2328its own unique\u2328items!\u232b\u222cTake the time to look around\u2328each stall!\u2390

\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Some people think animals\u2328don't feel emotions, but\u2328that's not true.\u232bThey love and care for\u2328one another, just\u2328like we do.\u232bIs there someone you love\u2328and care for in your life,\u2328\u232a?\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135It's said that dogs are\u2328man's best friend.\u232bIn addition to humans,\u2328though, dogs also like\u2328cows and sheep.\u232bDo you have any dogs on\u2328your farm, \u232a?\u232bThey can help you take\u2328care of any cows and\u2328sheep you have.\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Although cats can seem\u2328aloof, they actually\u2328like humans.\u232bAnd surprisingly, they\u2328also like chicks and\u2328chickens as well.\u232bDo you have any cats on\u2328your farm, \u232a?\u2328\u232bThey can help you take\u2328care of any chicks or\u2328chickens you have.\u2390

\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Here's a tip that might be\u2328helpful for you, \u232a.\u232bDid you know that your bell\u2328has a certain range in which\u2328it can be heard?\u232bTry ringing it in different\u2328spots and see what happens!\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Everybody has a special\u2328place they like to go\u2328to during their days off.\u232bWhat's my favourite spot?\u2328\u270bThat's a secret!\u2390

\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135How's the bazaar going? What\u2328kind of things do you have\u2328for sale right now?\u232bYou know the prices of your\u2328items will change depending\u2328on their quality, right?\u232bTherefore, sell high-quality\u2328products at the bazaar, and\u2328you'll make lots of money!\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135How's the bazaar?\u2328Are you getting\u2328lots of customers?\u232bCustomers will always\u2328have their preferences\u2328for products.\u232bAlways check out the\u2328latest trends. It's\u2328very important!\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135It's cold in the river! I've\u2328fallen in a few times!\u2328\u232bBut when I was underwater,\u2328I thought I saw something\u2328shiny down there...\u232bMaybe you'll see it if you\u2328fall in the river, too.\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Hmmm? Why am I in\u2328charge of running\u2328the Info Centre?\u232bWell, there are a\u2328lot of reasons,\u2328actually...\u232b\u270bAnd they're all secret!\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Have you been fishing?\u2328It's quite fun, you know.\u2328I enjoy it as well.\u232bFishing during a typhoon\u2328makes the waters...\u2328\u232d...flow a bit strangely!\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Fish have their favourite\u2328places, too.\u232bThe water upstream is\u2328quite different from\u2328the water downstream.\u232bTry fishing all over\u2328town to find out what\u2328fish live where.\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135I saw an interesting-looking\u2328fish near the grinding\u2328windmill!\u232bIt could be a new and\u2328undiscovered species!\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135In life, you will have\u2328rainy days and windy days.\u232bThere will be blizzards\u2328and typhoons.\u232bBut if you don't give up,\u2328you may find something nice\u2328where you least expect it!\u232bGood things will happen\u2328to you if you just keep\u2328trying!\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Everyone in town loves the\u2328river.\u232bHave you ever tossed trash\u2328into the river?\u232b\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2135When you do that, everyone\u2328\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f4a\u2135\u222dwill become \u232dangry with you.\u2328\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f49\u2135So be careful, OK?\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Things like flowers and\u2328mushrooms grow all\u2328around this town.\u232bFeel free to pick\u2328them up! They're\u2328yours to keep!\u232bAnd here's a tip: Harder\u2328to reach places tend to\u2328have better items!\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135If you see something like a\u2328flower on the ground,\u2328pick it up right away.\u232bIt won't be there the next\u2328day, so if you see something\u2328you like, grab it!\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135This town is full of\u2328nature, and thus\u2328full of bugs and frogs!\u232bYou can capture those\u2328critters, you know.\u232bThere are many types,\u2328so try and collect them\u2328all!\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Have you been able to catch\u2328bugs, or do they fly away\u2328when you try to catch them?\u232bThe trick is to walk\u2328slowly and sneak\u2328up on them!\u232bDon't try to rush things,\u2328or they'll notice you!\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Today, the windmills\u2328\u232dare...\u232eturning!♪\u232bSpinning and spinning,\u2328\u232dcreating...\u232ethe winds!♪\u232bThat's a song I made\u2328for the windmills.\u232b\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f49\u2135\u222eIt's not much.\u2328But I like to sing it\u2328while I work.\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135If you forget to water your\u2328crops and they get dry, just\u2328water them back to health.\u232bHowever, if your crops have\u2328completely dried up, no\u2328amount of water will help...\u232bWindmills are delicate\u2328things, but so are crops.\u232bBe sure to take good care\u2328of them. They're living\u2328things, after all.\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Are you taking care of your\u2328crops? You're not stepping\u2328on them, are you?\u222d\u232b\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f49\u2135You can damage your crops if\u2328you step on them, you know.\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135You should water your crops\u2328twice each day; once in\u2328the morning, once at night.\u232bWell-watered plants will\u2328grow up to be healthy.\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Crops will stay fresher\u2328in storage than they\u2328will in your bag.\u232bTalk to the carpenter\u2328here at the bazaar to\u2328upgrade your storage.\u232bThen your crops will\u2328last even longer!\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Have you been using\u2328fertiliser on your\u2328crops?\u232bIf you use fertiliser, your\u2328crops will be higher quality\u2328when you harvest them.\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Have you ever overeaten,\u2328\u232a? I do it all the\u2328time, unfortunately...\u232bI always get yelled\u2328at by Nellie because\u2328of it...\u232bIn the same way, too much\u2328fertiliser isn't good\u2328for your crops.\u232b\u222fAnyway, I think I need to\u2328control my eating\u2328habits better...\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Have you been cooking,\u2328\u232a?\u232b\u222cNellie's cooking is so good!\u2328It's part of the reason\u2328I'm so fat!\u232bBeing able to cook well\u2328can help you in many\u2328ways.\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Learning new recipes is\u2328always nice.\u232bBut true chefs are able to\u2328create their own recipes!\u232bYou can't just collect\u2328recipes from others\u2328to be a true chef.\u232bNellie is always talking\u2328about how much work it is.\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135You have a calendar, right,\u2328\u232a?\u232bThe calendar will help\u2328remind you when bazaars\u2328and other events are.\u232bIt's a very high-quality\u2328calendar, and very\u2328useful!\u232bIf you forget something,\u2328just go ahead and look it\u2328up on your calendar!\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Marian from the caf is very\u2328popular! I guess because\u2328she's so cute and nice...\u232b\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f4a\u2135There are even rumours that\u2328she has her own fan club!\u232b\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f49\u2135But I think my Nellie is\u2328much cuter and nicer!\u2328Ho ho ho!\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Ethel and Joan are\u2328very close. \u232bBut apparently, when they\u2328were young, they both fell\u2328in love with the same man...\u232bA lot happened, I hear...\u2328But now, they're best\u2328friends.\u232b\u222eI really admire the strength\u2328of their friendship.\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Have you tried jumping\u2328on the barrels that\u2328are around town?\u232bThey can help you jump much\u2328higher!\u232b\u222fBut I'm too heavy to\u2328jump on them... It\u2328makes me sad...\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Walking is nice, but\u2328running feels good\u2328too.\u232bApparently, you can run by\u2328using something called the\u2328"L Button".\u232bI wonder what this\u2328"L Button" is. I'm\u2328very curious about it...\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Horses are very kind to\u2328humans. I like them very\u2328much.\u232bThe higher your affection\u2328with your horse is, the\u2328faster it will run.\u232bTherefore, it's very\u2328important to be kind\u2328to your horse.\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Horses eat special treats\u2328made just for them. They\u2328seem a bit fancy.\u232bI wonder what those treats\u2328taste like... What? You're\u2328not at all curious?\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135You can check your ranks\u2328when you view your assets.\u232bYou earn ranks in fishing,\u2328cooking, critter catching...\u2328All sorts of things.\u232bAnd they all contribute\u2328towards your overall\u2328farming rank.\u232bBy the way, my rank is...\u2328\u270bActually, it's a secret.\u2328\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Apparently the assets \u2328will list the sizes of \u2328the fish you've caught.\u232bIt will be a good way \u2328for you to choose your \u2328fishing spot next time.\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135There's a board in your barn\u2328that you can use to check\u2328on your animals.\u232bIt lists how your animals\u2328feel and how they feel\u2328about you.\u232bUse it often to keep up on\u2328how your animals are doing!\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Farm animals like to be\u2328let outside in good weather.\u232bThey'll graze on their own,\u2328so you don't have to feed\u2328them.\u232bJust make sure to get them\u2328back inside by sunset.\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135It's important to have a\u2328high friendship level\u2328with your animals.\u232bThe more they love you, \u2328the better quality products\u2328they'll produce.\u232bThat's their way of\u2328repaying you for your love\u2328and kindness.\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Do you know what causes\u2328stress in your animals?\u232bIt's when you don't spend\u2328enough time with them.\u232bAnimals need attention.\u2328When they don't get it,\u2328they get stressed out.\u232b\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2135Animals that are stressed\u2328out fall ill easily.\u232b\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135So make sure you're giving\u2328your animals plenty of\u2328attention!\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135The training level of your\u2328animals is very important.\u232bIt shows how much they\u2328trust you.\u232bYou can build your training\u2328level with cats and dogs by\u2328playing with them.\u232bIf you have a horse,\u2328try taking it for\u2328a ride.\u232b\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f49\u2135Well-trained animals can\u2328be a big help on your farm!\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135You should become friends\u2328with everyone in town.\u232bIf you want to grow closer\u2328to someone, you should talk\u2328to them a lot.\u232bTalk to them in different\u2328places to learn new things\u2328about them.\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Getting a present is \u2328always a pleasant surprise.\u232bYou can give people presents\u2328by holding the present\u2328you want to give,\u232band then talking to the\u2328person. Easy, right?\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135What are the things you\u2328like and dislike?\u2328\u232b\u222cWell, the people\u2328here all have likes and\u2328dislikes too.\u232bIt's important to know\u2328someone's likes when you're\u2328giving them presents.\u232bA good gift will make\u2328someone like you more.\u2328But a bad gift...\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135When is your birthday?\u232b\u222cIt's important to remember\u2328people's birthdays.\u232bPeople will be extra happy\u2328if you give them a good gift\u2328on their birthday!\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135You can walk on the river\u2328in winter when it's frozen.\u232bIt's fun to walk to places \u2328you can't normally.\u232bIf you want to fish, there\u2328are spots where the ice\u2328is weak.\u232bYou can smash through them\u2328with a hammer.\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135When someone's having fun,\u2328a '♪' will appear above \u2328their head.\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Have you tried throwing the\u2328snowballs you can find\u2328during winter?\u232bI hear you can find things\u2328inside them sometimes.\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Have you tried making\u2328things with your windmills?\u232bItems made with windmills\u2328will fetch good prices.\u232b\u222cWindmills are amazing\u2328machines.\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Think about how far the\u2328wind travels.\u232bA breeze blowing through\u2328this town could have started\u2328half a world away...\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135Wonderfuls are so useful.\u2328They enhance windmills in\u2328all sorts of ways.\u232bI wish someone would\u2328call me wonderful...\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135The secret to a good\u2328relationship is putting\u2328\u232byourself in the\u2328other person's shoes.\u232bIf you don't understand\u2328where they're coming from,\u2328it'll never work out.\u2390
\u1f40\u1fc0\u1f48\u2135If you get a horse, this\u2328town will probably start\u2328having horse races again.\u232bRiding a horse is\u2328a good way to build\u2328friendship with it.\u2390
