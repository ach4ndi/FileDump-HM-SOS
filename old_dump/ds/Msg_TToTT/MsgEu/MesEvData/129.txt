\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136That was a bad storm\u2328yesterday.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136What can I do for you?
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136What can I do for you?
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136What can I do for you?
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f49\u2136Wow!\u2328How cute!
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f4b\u2136I'm...a little scared.\u2328I really don't like this...
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136What can I do for you?
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f49\u2136Oh. I once tried to give one\u2328of those to a woman who\u2328captured my heart.\u232b\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f4b\u2136I...I don't like to talk\u2328about it.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136No thanks...
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136I can't take another gift\u2328today. It's too much.\u2328Thanks, but no thanks.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136What can I do for you?
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136What can I do for you?
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Hey, don't give that away!
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f49\u2136Hey, a birthday present!\u2328You remembered!\u232bAnd it's \u206dCroquette\u206c! My\u2328favorite! These remind me\u2328of my mom.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f49\u2136\u206dCroquette\u206c!!!\u2328\u206dCroquette\u206c!!!\u2328\u206dCroquette\u206c!!!\u232bOops, I got a bit too\u2328excited...\u2328But thank you so much!
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136What can I do for you?
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136What can I do for you?
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f49\u2136Hey, a birthday present!\u2328You remembered!\u232b\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Don't tell Diego and\u2328Enrique about this.\u232bI don't want them to get\u2328jealous.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f49\u2136Woohoo!\u2328What a great gift!\u2328Thank you so much!
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Thank you for the birthday\u2328present.\u232bMy parents always gave\u2328me and my brothers the exact\u2328same thing for our birthday.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Thanks, \u232a.\u2328This is a nice gift.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f4b\u2136Are you playing a prank on\u2328me or something?\u232bI was hoping for a better\u2328present for my birthday.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f4a\u2136Did Enrique and Diego\u2328tell you to give this to\u2328me?\u232bThose guys are always trying\u2328to play pranks on me.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f4a\u2136\u206dScrap metal\u206c...?!\u2328This is the worst gift ever!\u2328Why would you give me this?
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136What can I do for you?
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136What can I do for you?
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Being married must be so\u2328nice...\u232bOh, Marion, I wonder what\u2328you're up to now...
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136I'm afraid of losing my hat\u2328in weather like this!
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Nobody shops in weather\u2328like this. It's terrible!
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f49\u2136You and I are the best\u2328of friends!\u232bBut I still can't give you\u2328any discounts at the shop.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f49\u2136You've been hanging out with\u2328me a lot lately, \u232a.\u232bYou must think I'm a cool\u2328guy. So I AM a cool guy!\u2328Yahoo!
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136I've traveled all over the\u2328world to find things to sell\u2328at my store.\u232bI've seen some amazing\u2328things!
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136You've got to have a good\u2328plan in business.\u232bIf you don't, your business\u2328will end up being a\u2328disaster.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136I think of ways to expand\u2328my business all the time.\u232bYou've got to keep\u2328innovating if you want to\u2328survive!
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Diego is the oldest, and\u2328Enrique is the youngest.\u232bSome people say we look\u2328a lot alike, but we're very\u2328different in personalities.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136How's your farm going?\u232bIn the last town I lived in,\u2328I had a friend who was a\u2328great farmer.

\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f49\u2136Hey, it's really cute! I\u2328don't get much chance to\u2328see animals like this.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f4a\u2136Yikes! I...I don't like\u2328this animal. Take it away,\u2328please.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136It's better to let it go.

\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Ooh, a mystery present!\u2328Neat!
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f49\u2136I'm thankful to have you as\u2328my friend, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136What can I do for you?
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136How's Diego doing?\u2328He'd better not be saying\u2328mean stuff about me.\u232bIf he is, I'll come and\u2328get him!
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Diego is a real trickster.\u2328Watch out if you're doing\u2328business with him.\u232bYou can always trust me,\u2328though.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136What can I do for you?
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136What can I do for you?
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136I'm going over to Diego's\u2328now. I haven't seen him\u2328in a long time.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136If you find anything\u2328that looks valuable, let\u2328me know.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136The air up here is so\u2328refreshing.\u232bI wonder if there's a way\u2328I could sell it...
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Everything is so different\u2328here. \u2328\u232bMaybe I can find something\u2328that will sell for a high \u2328price at my store.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Phew. I could use\u2328a rest.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136I've got to get back to the\u2328village tomorrow.\u2328My customers are waiting.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136I've got to get back to the\u2328village tomorrow.\u2328My customers are waiting.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136If I bottle up some of\u2328this spring water, I'm sure\u2328it will sell.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136The air is so clear and pure\u2328here. Too bad you can't\u2328charge for it...
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Phew. Finally home.\u2328Crossing the mountain sure\u2328takes a lot out of you.

\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Good morning, \u232a!\u2328I'm a morning person.\u2328I get up with the sun.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Good morning, \u232a.\u2328You like my outfit?\u232bI think it's a little over\u2328the top, but the customers\u2328seem to like it.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f49\u2136Hi there, \u232a.\u2328How are you doing?\u232bI'm doing great. So great,\u2328I almost feel like dancing!
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Hi there. I'm not feeling\u2328all that well today. I may\u2328have eaten something bad.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Hi there, \u232a.\u2328How are you doing?\u2328Me? I'm doing great! 
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Good evening.\u2328Hm, it's been a while since\u2328I've played guitar.\u232bYou should hear me sometime.\u2328I'm pretty good.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Hi there, \u232a...\u2328Sunsets always make me feel\u2328a little sad.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Good evening, \u232a.\u2328...\u2328......\u232bOh, sorry. I was spacing\u2328out a bit.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136What can I do for you?
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136What can I do for you?
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136What can I do for you?
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136I can't concentrate with you\u2328here. It's bad for business.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Uno, dos, tres...\u2328...\u232bI lost count of the money\u2328because you spoke to me.\u2328I'll talk to you later.

\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f4b\u2136Enrique's always been the\u2328cleverest. He never got in\u2328trouble when we were kids.
\u1f46\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136The sales in my shop are\u2328getting worse than my\u2328brothers'. Not good!
