No is NO!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you very much.
I had a fun time
talking with you. {32_7_208}
----------x----------
There's really no
reason but... {NextPage_49}
I thought I'd like
to listen to
{CharName_28}'s story. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_28} came to
{Location_43_30_23}
a long time ago and{NextPage_1}has been here since. {NextPage_49}
Doesn't she ever
think about going
back to {Location_43_31_23}? {NextPage_49}
What about her love
in the city...? {NextPage_49}
What about being
fashionable...? {NextPage_49}
Is she really
okay without them?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's not what I
mean... {NextPage_49}
I was just wondering
if all she's ever
done was be part {NextPage_1}of the dig that's
going on. {NextPage_49}
Never mind, I'm
just being silly. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you, {CharName_28}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really learned
a lot from this.
Thank you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Uncle, were you
listening to us? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was just thinking
of what to do
next... {32_2_188}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks a lot. {32_2_188}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But the carrots
don't taste
good... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why so soon...?
I wanted to hear
more stories... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, sing
something in honor
of him!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, excuse me... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I said excuse me... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, you have
nothing to sell. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Bring something that
can be sold. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm just looking... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I said I'm just
looking... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How much is that
{29_0}?
{41_3_2}It goes for {2a_1_5}G.
{2a_2_5}G.
Not for sale.
----------x----------
{50_16_0_10}You'll give me
a discount? {32_1_244}
{50_16_0_0}Oh, but I don't have
money with me, so I
can't buy it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But I don't have any
money with me, so I
can't buy it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}Hmph, I didn't want
it anyway. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't have any
money with me, so
I can't buy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah, you run
the farm right? {NextPage_49}
Are you working
hard? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}I don't want to
talk right now... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}Can I help you...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good morning.
Where are you going? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_10}Hello.
Are you well? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You should hurry
home. Your wife is
waiting for you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing
up in the middle
of the night? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing
up in the middle
of the night? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you come to
visit me? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you need to
come here too? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_10}Oh, that's my
favorite!
Can I have it? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_3}Yea! Thanks.
You're wonderful! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}You're so cheap... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks really
good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got something
good, haven't you?
Can I have it? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
That looks
soooo good... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}You've got another
thing coming if you
think I'll eat that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_4}I hate things like
that... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}What's that...?
Please take that
away from me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Aw, he's so cuuute.
I'll play with him
when he gets bigger. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll play with him
when he gets much
bigger. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a cute
dog. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want a dog
too... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a cute
little kitty. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like how free
and independent
cats are... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you raising
chickens on your
farm? {NextPage_49}
I'm not good with
chickens at all. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, it's so cute... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute little
chicky. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I said I'm no good
when it comes to
chickens... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Haven't seen a
duck in awhile. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute little
duck. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't help but
like ducks.
They're so cuuute. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that...
It looks like a
flower seed... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you have any
veggies I'll give
them to my mom. {NextPage_49}
That will make her
happy for sure. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom would definitely
want some. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you get that
milk from your farm?
I love fresh milk. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I drink milk
my stomach gets
all rumbly. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll give that to
my Mom... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't just
eat butter all
by itself. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}I don't like eggs. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_5}I said I don't
like eggs! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a weird
looking thing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can you eat that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make this?
Not bad! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I eat that?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
A tasty looking
dish.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you going
to do with that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't want that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't spin around
with that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that...
A watering can?
It's shaped weird. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a strange
watering can. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is there water
inside that can? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't water me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?
It's a weird
machine. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you going
to do with that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's used for
cutting hair... {NextPage_49}
You should try
using that on Hugh.
{50_16_0_3}{34_1_87}Ha ha ha... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't need
anything like that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty
stone. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty
stone. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_87}That's an unusual
piece... {NextPage_49}
Where did you
pick it up from? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really like things
like that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that flower...
A present for me? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty
flower. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a record.
I know what it is.
Dad had one once. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My Dad would love it
if you showed that
to him. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that? {NextPage_49}
You should mix that
in food and then
give it to my Mom. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It smells nice... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}It makes a funny
sound. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}That's a strange
drum... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's so special
about that medal?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's just gold
"plated" right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A strange necklace.
That's not a present
for me is it? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty
necklace. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that...
I don't know
what it is... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you going
to do with that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That firework is
huge... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Tell me when you are
going to shoot it
off. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a present
for someone? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't want that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_26}How could someone
call a girl like me
a tomboy? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think my neighbor
Hugh is handsome,
but whenever we {NextPage_1}get together he
I can't help but
pick on him. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's nothing to
do around here, so
I get bored easy. {NextPage_49}
But then again
there are many
things I like too... {NextPage_49}
Of course the
city is also
good... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom told me the
farmer in Mineral
Town is a miser. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad told me that
the farmer in
Mineral Town is a{NextPage_1}very popular guy.
Is he really? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0}'s fields
are pretty amazing
I heard. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0}'s animals
must be in Heaven. {NextPage_49}
They get so well
taken care of... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom told me all the
farmer in Mineral
Town does is mine. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad told me the
farmer in Mineral
Town is an {NextPage_1}incredibly famous
fisherman. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} of
Mineral Town has
walked over {NextPage_1}1,000,000 steps
in his lifetime... {NextPage_49}
I'm not very
impressed by that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} of
Mineral Town has
worked over 50 years. {NextPage_49}
You better do
something with your
farm, okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad told me that the
farmer in Mineral
Town has really {NextPage_1}great luck when
fishing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom told me that the
farmer in Mineral
Town has bad taste. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer in
Mineral Town owns
3 vacation houses. {NextPage_49}
My Mom is really
jealous of him. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad said there is a
great blacksmith
in Mineral Town. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_10}The food you gave me
last time was
delicious. {NextPage_49}
Give me some more
again sometime. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_10}The {29_0}
you made last time
was great. {NextPage_49}
I love food that has
intense flavors. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The dish you made
last time was
delicious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're really working
hard, aren't you? {NextPage_49}
Mom says you've
become a great
farmer. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Seems like things
have gotten better
for you at the farm. {NextPage_49}
You're really
trying hard, aren't
you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How's your farm
going? {NextPage_49}
You seem to be
getting the hang
of things... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't really like
living here much. {NextPage_49}
It's just so
boring. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This lifestyle
might be for me. {NextPage_49}
There's nothing to
really do, so I get
to look at things {NextPage_1}and think about them
all on my own. {NextPage_49}
I've been enjoying
that lately. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess the most fun
is when I play with
Hugh... {NextPage_49}
I'm just being nice
though, nothing more
than that. {NextPage_49}
{50_16_0_25}I don't pick on him,
I'm nice to him. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lately even when
I pick on Hugh, he
doesn't cry. {NextPage_49}
He actually talks
back to me. {NextPage_49}
He must finally
be rebelling. {NextPage_49}
It makes him
cooler... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's so many
weird people here
I could never get {NextPage_1}tired of talking
to any of them. {NextPage_49}
I love getting all
sorts of news
from people. {NextPage_49}
I should write
a book about
everyone here... {NextPage_49}
I'm gonna make
the stories more
interesting. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello.
Do you think I'm
a tomboy?
{41_2_1}I think so.
Not at all.
----------x----------
{50_16_0_26}I knew it...
I think so too. {NextPage_49}
{50_16_0_35}I always knew I
should have been
born a boy. {NextPage_49}
If I was a boy I
wouldn't get called
tomboy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You really think so?
Are you sure you're
not flattering me? {NextPage_49}
I don't care if you
think am or not... {NextPage_49}
That's just my
personality. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi. Want to know
what I'm thinking?
{41_3_1}Sure.
No thanks.
Don't care.
----------x----------
Really?
Okay...
Um... {NextPage_49}
Never mind I can't
do it. {NextPage_49}
I'm not done yet.
When it's complete
I'll tell you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I see.
Never mind then. {NextPage_49}
Well when you want
to know, you'll come
back and beg me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay... I'm still in
the middle of making
it... {NextPage_49}
I'll tell you about
it next time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish I lived a
more stimulating
lifestyle... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I'll become
a novelist. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You look like you
have time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom was getting on
my nerves so I
figured I go out {NextPage_1}somewhere and
take a walk... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My Mom was yelling
at me, so I decided
to get out of there. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm SO bored... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's better to think
about things outside.{NextPage_49}
You get so many more
images in your head
as a result. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't there anything
to do here...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love it when the
air is nice and warm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If I go back home
Mom is going to
yell at me again. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If I go back home
Mom will start
nagging me again. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lately if you go to
the beach at night,
you can see such {NextPage_1}pretty red stars
in the sky. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what I'll
do today... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's been hot
lately. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why does Mom nag
me so much... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why does Mom nag
me so much...? {NextPage_49}
I'm already an
adult... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love this season. {NextPage_49}
Just wandering
around and enjoying
the scenery. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you look above
the waterfall,
you can see a pretty{NextPage_1}blue star in the sky.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's cold, isn't
it...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi, what's up?{32_1_244}
{50_16_0_25}...I was just
thinking about{NextPage_1}something...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This place is so
calming. {NextPage_49}
It's the perfect
place to think of
about things. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's up?
You have free time? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Go over there.
I'm trying to zone
out! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_35}Thinking... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm talking to
Romana. {NextPage_49}
Maybe I'll use her
as a character in
my book?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Romana has lived a
long life, so she's
sure to have some {NextPage_1}really good stories
to listen to. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm busy, don't
bother me now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm talking to
Lumina. {NextPage_49}
Maybe I'll use her
as a character in
my book?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lumina's ideas are
a really good source
for my book. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm a little busy
right now so
don't bother me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm talking with
Sebastian. {NextPage_49}
Maybe I'll use him
as a character in
my book?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sebastian knows
a lot so he's a
good source for {NextPage_1}when I write my
future book. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}I'm busy right now,
so please don't
bother me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm talking with
Gustafa right now.{NextPage_49}
Maybe I'll use him
as a character in
my book? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Gustafa is both a
poet and musician. {NextPage_49}
That's why he feels
so deeply for
things. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}I'm busy right now,
so please don't
bother me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you.
But I changed my
mind. {NextPage_49}
Come back again
sometime okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm about to sleep
so... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time for me
to go to bed, so
you'll need to go. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time for me to
get going... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really have to
get going so... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See you... {NextPage_0}
