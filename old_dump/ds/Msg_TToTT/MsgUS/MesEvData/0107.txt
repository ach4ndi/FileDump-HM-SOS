\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136The wind was really howling\u2328yesterday, wasn't it?\u232bI hope the plants made it\u2328through that okay.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f49\u2136This cat is cute, isn't it?\u2328Hee hee! Hey, little guy...\u232bI like cats because they're\u2328so independent.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f4c\u2136Hey!\u2328I d-don't want th-that thing\u2328anywhere near me.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Looks like a blue feather...\u232b\u1f46\u1fad\u1f4d\u2136Wait, you don't mean...\u2328...that it's for me!?!?\u232bW-Wait a second, buster!\u2328This isn't the place. We\u2328need somewhere to talk NOW.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136What do you plan to do with\u2328that blue feather?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136All of a sudden you want to\u2328give me that?\u2328I don't think so...
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f4c\u2136I appreciate the thought,\u2328but I couldn't take another\u2328gift today.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136A present for me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fad\u1f49\u2136Thanks, \u232a.\u2328That's...very nice of you.

\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?

\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136What? A gift? You mean I can\u2328have this?\u232b\u1f46\u1fad\u1f49\u2136This is quite nice.\u2328Thank you.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136What? A birthday present?\u2328Oh, that's right, today is\u2328my birthday. So...thanks.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136What? A present?\u232b\u1f46\u1fad\u1f49\u2136I see... Thank you.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136What? A birthday present?\u2328Oh, that's right, today is\u2328my birthday.\u232b\u1f46\u1fad\u1f4c\u2136But...but...this thing...\u2328It's... I don't... AARRGH!\u2328I'll take it, I guess.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136What? A present?\u232b\u1f46\u1fad\u1f4c\u2136But...but...this thing...\u2328It's... I don't... AARRGH!\u2328I'll take it, I guess.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136What? A present? But it's\u2328slimy and gross and...\u2328\u232b\u1f46\u1fad\u1f4c\u2136\u20d0Waaaaaahhhhh!?!?\u232bIt's a blotch snakehead!\u2328Don't bring it any closer!\u2328You...you...dumb, stupid...\u232b...But you went to the\u2328trouble, so I'll take it...\u2328JUST THIS ONCE, BUSTER!!
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Is married life suiting you?\u232bMayor Ina would be a good\u2328person to talk to if you\u2328ever face problems.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136I worry about the village's\u2328plants in this weather...\u232bIt can't be very good for\u2328people, either. You should\u2328try to stay out of it.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136You can hardly see a thing\u2328in that blizzard. Glad I've\u2328got research to do indoors.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136I'm usually so awkward with\u2328people, but I'm always\u2328comfortable talking to you.\u232b\u1f46\u1fad\u1f49\u2136How can I say this...?\u2328I feel like I can be\u2328myself with you, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f4c\u2136I tend to offend people\u2328without meaning to.\u2328\u232bI'm just...not very good at\u2328talking to people. I'm not\u2328trying to be mean.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136It takes a season or two\u2328before your trees will\u2328bear fruit.\u232bOf course, they'll only bear\u2328fruit in the right season.\u2328\u232bSo you want to carefully\u2328plan when you plant your\u2328fruit trees.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136If you plant many different\u2328trees, you can harvest\u2328different fruits year round.\u232bAnd fruit trees don't need\u2328to be watered, which is\u2328quite convenient.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Our orchards produce\u2328different kinds of fruit all\u2328through the year to harvest.\u232bHave you tried growing fruit\u2328trees yourself? Gombe sells\u2328the seeds for them.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136I came to this village\u2328because so many different\u2328plants grow here.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136I've got research to do.\u2328I don't have time to chat.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f4c\u2136Right now, talking with you\u2328just makes me want to\u2328explode with anger.\u232bSo what do you want to say\u2328to me, buster?
\u2332 I'm so sorry!\u2328 If that's how you feel...
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Umm, I see... Well, I guess\u2328since you apologized, I can\u2328forgive you.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f4b\u2136You dumb...stupid...ARRRGH!
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Yesterday's weather was\u2328awful. I hope the plants\u2328are all right.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136A gift for Harmony Day?\u232b\u1f46\u1fad\u1f49\u2136You're such a thoughtful\u2328husband! Thanks!
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f49\u2136\u206dTofu salad\u206c!?\u2328For me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fad\u1f4d\u2136You remembered my favorite\u2328for my birthday!
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136\u206dTofu salad\u206c!\u2328\u1f46\u1fad\u1f49\u2136You know me so well!\u2328Thanks.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Umm, \u2391, can we go\u2328for a walk?\u2328
\u2332 Sure.\u2328 Not today.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136I see...\u2328No, no, that's fine.\u2328Some other time.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f4c\u2136\u20d0WHAT IN THE WORLD!?\u2328I hate this!\u232bAnd this is supposed to be a\u2328BIRTHDAY PRESENT for me!?\u2328Ugh. But, um, thanks anyway.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f4c\u2136Huh? \u20d0WHAT IN THE WORLD!?\u2328I hate this!\u232b\u1f46\u1fad\u1f4b\u2136We're married now, remember?\u2328You should know by now what\u2328things I CAN'T STAND!!
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136I have a life growing inside\u2328me! I can hardly believe it!
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f49\u2136Do you think we should name\u2328our baby after a flower?\u2328That might be nice...
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Our baby will be born soon.\u2328Who do you think it'll look\u2328more like?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f4d\u2136It's so nice to have you to\u2328wake up to in the morning!
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Since you're handling the\u2328farm, \u2391, I can continue\u2328with my research.\u232b\u1f46\u1fad\u1f4d\u2136I really appreciate that.\u2328
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136I never thought I'd be\u2328married. I was always so\u2328focused on my research.\u232b\u1f46\u1fad\u1f49\u2136But somehow I met you,\u2328\u2391. I feel so lucky.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136You're always working so\u2328hard. Don't forget to look\u2328after your health.\u232bWhen you get tired, you need\u2328to rest.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136I do talk to plants now and\u2328then, but that doesn't mean\u2328I'm crazy!\u232bIt's part of my research on\u2328the sensitivity of plants.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Umm, \u2391?\u2328What do you think of my\u2328cooking?\u232b\u1f46\u1fad\u1f4c\u2136I know it's not the best,\u2328but I'm trying.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Because Konohana has a\u2328stable climate, many\u2328kinds of plants grow here.\u232bEven coffee beans and cacao.\u2328In winter there are oranges.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f4c\u2136I feel like we don't\u2328communicate with each other\u2328anymore...
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Can you possibly be\u2328satisfied with our married\u2328life as it is these days?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f4a\u2136Isn't there something you\u2328need to say to your wife,\u2328buster?
\u2332 I'm so, so sorry.\u2328 Nothing comes to mind.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f49\u2136Well, since you apologize,\u2328I guess I have to forgive\u2328you THIS time.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f4a\u2136No...? I see... Hmph!
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136What's that?\u2328Are you taking it to today's\u2328\u1000?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Umm, yeah.\u2328So...do you like cats?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f49\u2136If it isn't a raccoon!!\u2328A cute little guy, too!
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f4c\u2136Waaaah!?\u2328It's a bird, A BIRD!!!\u2328Get it away from me!
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136What do you think you're\u2328doing, nabbing wild animals?\u232bPut it back where you found\u2328it.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f49\u2136Ummm... That's not a\u2328bad outfit. It looks...\u2328nice on you.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Umm, hey...\u2328Would you like to take a\u2328walk with me right now?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Could we talk a little bit?\u2328Would that be okay?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136I'm going for a walk.\u2328Do you want to come, or not?
\u2332 Okay, let's do that.\u2328 I'll pass for today.
\u2332 Sure, let's talk.\u2328 Now's not a good time.
\u2332 Okay, I'll come along.\u2328 Not today.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136I see...\u2328Fine, then. Goodbye.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f4d\u2136I...I understand. It wasn't\u2328anything important anyway.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Umm...I see.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f49\u2136That's a pretty flower.\u2328Oh, is today Flower Day?\u2328That explains it. Thanks.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f49\u2136I study flowers all the\u2328time, but this is special\u2328since it comes from you.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136The Starry Night Festival is\u2328tomorrow, so...\u2328will you go with me, or not?
\u2332 Yes, I'll go with you.\u2328 Sorry, I have to pass.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f49\u2136Y-You will? You're sure?\u2328Thanks! I can't wait!
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136You have to pass, you said?\u2328Fine, no need to apologize.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f49\u2136I can't wait for the Starry\u2328Night Festival!
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f49\u2136It's nicely wrapped.\u2328I wonder what it contains...
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136You're the only friend that\u2328I can be totally open with,\u2328\u232a.\u232b\u1f46\u1fad\u1f49\u2136That's why I hope you'll\u2328always live in Konohana.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Different plants grow on the\u2328other side of the mountain\u2328towards Bluebell.\u232bThe ecosystem is quite\u2328different on that side.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Sometimes I prefer the\u2328company of plants to people.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Huh? What?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136I know you're in a rush,\u2328but don't be careless.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f49\u2136In springtime, the flowers\u2328are lovely, and into summer\u2328we see vivid greenery.\u232bIt's a verdant season.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136It's hot in the summer, so\u2328I love the cool breezes on\u2328the mountain.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Fall, when the leaves turn.\u2328I could spend hours just\u2328looking at autumn foliage.\u232bThe reds, oranges, and\u2328yellows are so beautiful.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136During the winter, the\u2328ground gets icy, so be\u2328careful not to slip.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Fieldwork is the most\u2328important part of my\u2328research.\u232bI go to study plants on the\u2328mountain whenever I can.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Today I'm organizing all my\u2328samples for analysis.\u232bI go to the town hall for\u2328reference materials that\u2328I don't have at home.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Konohana won the Cooking\u2328Festival this time.\u232bI guess you did a good job\u2328of cheering us on.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Konohana lost the Cooking\u2328Festival this time.\u232bMaybe you should have done a\u2328better job of cheering.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Today's Cooking Festival\u2328was a lot of fun.\u232bNext time I hope you'll\u2328represent Konohana.
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Too bad about today's\u2328Cooking Festival.\u2328Better luck next time!
\u1f46\u1fad\u1f48\u2136How are you, \u232a?

\u1f46\u1fad\u1f49\u2136The \u1000\u2328is today.\u2328I hate crowds.
