\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f49\u2136Cool! I enjoy teaching\u2328people about horses and\u2328carts.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f48\u2136First of all, I'll show you\u2328how to ride a horse.\u232bPress the \u206dA Button\u206c to\u2328get on your horse.\u232bPress the \u206dB Button\u206c to\u2328get off the horse.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f49\u2136Easy, yeah?
\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f48\u2136Now let me tell you about\u2328your cart.\u232bToday I brought it here, but\u2328it's usually parked to the\u2328\u206dleft of your house\u206c.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f49\u2136Your cart can carry lots\u2328more stuff than you can fit\u2328in your bag alone!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f48\u2136If you want to see the items\u2328in the cart, stand next to\u2328it and press the \u206dA Button\u206c.\u232bThen the bottom screen will\u2328look like this:
\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f48\u2136When your bag is full, use\u2328your cart to store items.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f49\u2136Perishable items like crops\u2328and milk will actually last\u2328longer in your cart.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f48\u2136The cart works the same as\u2328your bag.\u232bUse the \u206d+Control Pad\u206c to\u2328move the cursor, and press\u2328the \u206dA Button\u206c to select.\u232bPress the \u206dB Button\u206c\u2328when you're done.\u2328Try it out!

It should be\u2328a big help!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f48\u2136But to take it off your\u2328farm, you'll need to \u206dhitch\u206c\u2328it to your horse.\u232bFor that, get on your horse,\u2328stand next to the cart,\u2328and press the \u206dR Button\u206c.\u232bTo unhitch them, park the\u2328cart back in its spot and\u2328press the \u206dR Button\u206c.
