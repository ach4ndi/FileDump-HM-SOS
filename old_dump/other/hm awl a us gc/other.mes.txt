How are you doing, old friend?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Well, I guess you don't have to worry
about things like that where you are.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When {CharName_73} married your
son,{32_3_232}
the farm wasn't in the best of shape,
to say the least...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But {CharName_29} and the others
helped build a nice kitchen.{NextPage_49}
...I guess they didn't have enough time
to worry about decorating it, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_4}'s father helped build a
nice kitchen for his daughter.{NextPage_49}
I guess he didn't have enough time
to worry about decorating it, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But {CharName_27} and the others
helped build a nice kitchen.{NextPage_49}
I guess they didn't have enough time

Your son's working hard.
The farm's doing fine.{NextPage_0}

{CharName_2} seems very happy

{CharName_4} didn't used to be much of a cook,

Kids are very cute at this age.

Hey there,
come here a second.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Excuse me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pardon me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Excuuuse me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um, you really shouldn't open a
shop unless you have something to sell.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you all sold out for today?
You might as well close up shop.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you don't have anything,
there's no point in having a shop...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't you have anything to sell?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm just looking, thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Not much here, is there?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I said I'm just looking...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like the {29_0}, but
how much is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
Really?!
That's a great deal.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK, thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a little expensive, but...
OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I'll pass.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want the {29_0}, but
how much is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
No, I'm just looking.{NextPage_0}

Hello, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}

I'm not feeling well today.
I don't want to talk.{NextPage_0}

I'm just not feeling well today.{NextPage_0}

I said I don't want to talk...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Leave me alone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm tired today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you want something...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is ridiculous...
Just ridiculous...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I told you, I'm tired today...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good morning.{NextPage_0}

Hello, how are you?{NextPage_0}

Hello.{NextPage_0}

Good evening.{NextPage_0}

Good evening.{NextPage_0}

What are you doing out so late?{NextPage_0}

Welcome...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing out so late?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you have some business here too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's one of my favorites.
Could I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Really?
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks delicious...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got something nice there.
Could I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
I just love that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You expect me to eat that?
Are you trying to annoy me or what?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yuck. Take that away.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that??
Why don't you throw that away?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where did you get something like that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How cute.
Looks like Celia...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Any child of yours and Celia's must
be clever.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How cute.
Looks like Muffy...{NextPage_0}

Any child of yours and Muffy's must

Dogs can learn all kinds of tricks

Cats can be a little selfish. If you
bother them too much they won't like you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute cat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a chicken from your farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute little chick.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How cute.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear that if you take good care of your
chickens, they may lay golden eggs.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ducks can't keep their eggs warm
by themselves.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute duck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ducks are pretty cute when you
get a good look at them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what kind of plant will grow
when you plant that seed...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that some kind of seed?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you grow that on your farm?
Feel free to give me some once in a while.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There sure are many kinds of crops.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that milk from your farm?
It must be fresh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The taste of milk changes depending on the
type of cow and how they are cared for.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that cheese on your farm?
...{24_2}Farm original cheese.
...Right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cheese tastes different depending on what
kind of milk you use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that butter on your farm, right?
...{24_2}Farm original butter.
...Right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Butter tastes different depending on what
kind of milk you use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The quality of their eggs depends on how
the chickens are raised.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Chicken eggs and duck eggs look the
same, don't they?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you catch that fish yourself?
...Good job.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a fine looking fish.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are those wild plants from around here?
They can be quite delicious in cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are some unusual wild plants growing
around here. That's one of them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that dish?
...It looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you cook?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a tasty looking dish.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an unusual hoe.
It looks quite heavy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't see a hoe like that every day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe was used a lot.
But... do you know how to use it well?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's certainly a dirty hoe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe looks quite new.
You've got to use it more...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You haven't used that hoe much, have you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Soon your hoe will be nicely broken in.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where are you going with that hoe?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that your hoe?
It's seen a lot of use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks easy to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's certainly an unusual sickle.
But it looks hard to use...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an odd sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That sickle certainly looks sharp.
You shouldn't wave it around like that.{NextPage_48}
----------x----------
That's a weird sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that your sickle?
You've got to use it more, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That sickle is still pretty new.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Soon your sickle will be nicely broken in.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't just walk around with a sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that your sickle?
It looks quite nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That sickle looks very sharp.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a watering can?
It has an odd shape.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a strange watering can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You haven't used that watering
can very much yet, have you?
You've got to water your crops every day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That watering can is brand new, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Watering cans get easier to use the
more you use them, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Watering some plants?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an old watering can, isn't it?
But it looks very easy to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've used that watering can quite a bit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a strange looking machine.
Oh, a milker... I see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milker is brand new, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You use that to milk your cows every day?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where do you think you're going
with that milker?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milker looks pretty beat up.
But I guess cows like things that
they're used to.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milker's been used quite a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I used to get my hair cut with clippers.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are those manual clippers?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those clippers are pretty new.
A present for your sheep, maybe?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You haven't used those clippers much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those much make shearing sheep easy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going to give me a trim?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those clippers have been well used.
And they look very easy to use, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are some old clippers you've got.
----------x----------
Tools are hard to use when they're new,
but they get easier to use with time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't you get a little excited when
you get a new tool?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got to put that to good use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good tools make your work much easier.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can tell a lot about a person
by looking at his tools.
Don't you think so?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...That's a very mature looking tool...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an unusual stone you've got there.
You could probably get some money for it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a pretty stone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that thing?
Where did you find it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks kind of spooky.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear that some of the wild plants around
here have mysterious properties.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you find that around here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a record, isn't it?
You don't see many of those around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those aren't for throwing, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that some kind of spice?
I bet you got it from {CharName_25}, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet it would taste good in many
dishes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}That's a funny sound.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}That's a strange drum, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that the medal that Wally
had?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty medal.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a strange looking necklace.
There must be a story behind that...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty necklace.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That...
That looks like some kind of music.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why are you showing me that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Fireworks?
I bet Kassey made that, right?
Or was it Patrick...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's quite a large firework.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a present for someone?
Hmm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's no point showing me that.{NextPage_0}

You know, I heard that the
owner of the farm in
Mineral Town is very rich.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear the owner of the farm in
Mineral Town is insanely greedy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Apparently the farmer in Mineral Town
is very popular with the townspeople.
Is that really true?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral Town
is a really nice person.
Maybe she'll run for mayor?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Making all those crops and still having
time for taking care of animals. Oh I'm
talking about the farmer in Mineral Town.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard a rumor that {29_0} has
shipped every crop there is.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It seems that the farmer in Mineral
Town is very good to her
animals.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet the animals on {29_0}'s
farm are happy.
They're well taken care of, after all...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral Town
digs holes in the mountain all day long.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If somebody spends all day digging for
ore, are they really a farmer?
Oh, I mean the farmer in Mineral Town.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It seems {29_0} from Mineral Town
caught all kinds of fish. But I bet
she hasn't caught fish that we have here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear that the farmer in Mineral Town
is a master angler.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that {29_0} from
Mineral town has walked one million steps.
But so what?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That farmer from Mineral Town sure does
walk around an awful lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} in Mineral Town has been
running that farm for 50 years.
You'd better work hard too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer from mineral town certainly has
lived a long life.
That farm has been there over 50 years.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear that the farmer in Mineral Town
is a quite the fisherman...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral Town
fishes all day and ignores her farm.
Is that really true?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral Town
has bad taste.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't have to make everything gold,
you know... Oh, I'm talking about
{29_0} Farm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard a rumor that the farmer in Mineral
Town owns three cottages.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Apparently the farmer in Mineral Town
likes building extra cottages.
Even though the family is small.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess there are some pretty amazing
tools at {29_0} Farm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard there's a blacksmith in Mineral
Town who makes some great tools.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That thing you gave me a while back
was really tasty.
Did you know that was one of my favorites?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That thing you gave me a while back
was really bad.
Do you have it in for me or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About the {29_0} you gave me
a while back... It tasted a little off.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About the {29_0} you gave me
a while back... It was pretty good.
I'd like more sometime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About the {29_0} you gave me
a while back... It was good.
No, really.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About the {29_0} you gave me a
while back... That's the taste I like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About that milk you gave me a bit ago...
It tasted... Very nutritious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About that milk you gave me a bit ago.
The taste was a little off.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About that milk you gave me a bit ago...
It wasn't bad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About that milk you gave me a bit ago...
It tasted pretty good, but it was just
Normal Cow's milk right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About that milk you gave me a bit ago...
It was the greatest!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About that milk you gave me a bit ago...
The taste was a little off.
But it might be good for cheese.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About that milk you gave me a bit ago...
It wasn't bad, but it might be better
if you processed it into something else.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
was quite good, but I think it would be
even better made into cheese.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
tasted fantastic. You must
make some of that into cheese.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
tasted really expensive, but maybe
the taste was a little on the weak side.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
tasted good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
Was really rich and delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
must be the best milk in the world. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
tasted a little off, but perhaps it
would be better if it was in cheese.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
was just OK. It might be better
if you processed it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
tasted quite good, but it might be
better if it were made into butter.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
tasted fantastic.
But maybe it's a little too rich.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
had kind of a unique flavor.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
tasted good, but it had a kind of a
unique tart flavor.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave was rich and
very delicious.
I'd be glad to take some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave me was a little
sour. But I could grow to like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That kind of cheese you gave me a bit ago
is hard to come by, you know.
It's quite valuable.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that cheese you gave me
a while ago?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter you gave me was rich
and very delicious.
I'd be glad to take some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter you gave me was a little
smelly. But I could grow to like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That kind of butter you gave me a bit ago
is hard to come by, you know.
It's quite valuable.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that butter you gave me
a while ago?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me was
just fantastic.
You made it, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That dish you gave me a bit ago
was just OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That fish you caught the other day
tasted fantastic.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That fish you caught the other day
tasted OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The wild plants you gave me the other day
tasted just great.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The wild plants you gave me the other day
tasted OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That thing you gave me. It's hard
to put into words how it tasted.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks like you're better
at your work now.
You're a real farmer now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're quite good at growing crops,
aren't you?
You seem suited for that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're quite good at cooking,
I hear.
You must have a gift.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You must be working hard tending to your
cows. You seem more distinguished now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Raising crops is difficult work, but
you're doing it well.
I can tell by looking at your hands.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you often cook at home?
I heard you're quite a cook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess you're getting used to
running a dairy farm, hmm?{NextPage_0}

Do you have some business

How's work on the farm?{NextPage_0}

This time of year is really comfortable.{NextPage_0}

We have four seasons here in Forget-

comfortable. It's hot now, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can see some pretty stars over the
Southern Sea this time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is the best time of year for me.
Not too hot, not too cold.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It sure is pretty when the leaves
start to change color.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It snows sometimes at this time of
year, even here.
It's kind of exciting.{NextPage_0}

{29_0} from Mineral Town has a

I wonder what a chicken festival is like.
Oh, It's just that I heard the farmer in

Everyone's talking about that dish.{NextPage_0}

I heard that {29_0} is helping
people with cooking now.
I wonder why.{NextPage_0}

They say that a person {29_0}
gave a farmer some information
about some kind of legendary food.{NextPage_0}

I heard that {29_0} went on a
trip looking for some kind of legendary
food. I guess it's pretty difficult.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They say that {29_0} was able to
find some kind of legendary food.{NextPage_49}
But just when things were looking good,
{29_0} lost to some other chef.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} is going on a final
journey... following the last wishes of
{29_0}'s master.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} has gone somewhere
in Forget-me-not Valley to fight a wizard.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a relief.
Thanks to {29_0} defeating
the wizard,{NextPage_49}
the world is now at peace...
Wait, weren't we at peace before?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mooooooo!!{32_3_232}

Takakura left you a note.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.......Mmm.........Mmm.......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Animal TV...
Moo Cow 'n Sheepy Sheep
on the TV...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your grandchild's gotten a lot bigger.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, and...{52_0_0_0}
{39_1}{CharName_0} has added on to the house.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The kid's helping around the house.
Well, sometimes anyway...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Anyway, I look forward to the future.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}{CharName_1}'s quite mischievous.
But I suppose you were the same way at
that age...{32_39_16}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} seems to want to
imitate everything {CharName_0} does.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} is a quiet, gentle child.
Like {CharName_0}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} seems to want to
imitate everything {CharName_0} does.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He must really love that kid.
He worked for years to make a nice
children's room.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure they'll work hard at
the farm from now on.
I'll have to do my best, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Work on the farm seems to be going well
and they've even added on a child's bedroom.{NextPage_49}
When children get older, they need
a room of their own. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your daughter is really starting to
act like a mother.{NextPage_49}
It makes me feel old
though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} grows bigger all the
time. Reminds me of you when you were
that age.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Children may not always
turn out how their parents hope.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}But {CharName_1} looks quite
healthy.
That's the important thing.{32_11_184}
----------x----------
Who's that, you
ask?{32_3_232} It's that young scoundrel...{32_3_232} {CharName_1}.
{CharName_0}'s child.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} is at a difficult stage
when one rebels against everything.
Don't you remember feeling that way?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Who's that, you ask?{32_3_232}
Why, it's...{32_3_232} {CharName_1}.{NextPage_49}
{CharName_0}'s kid.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} is at a difficult stage.
Adolescence...
Don't you remember that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, and look closely.{52_0_0_0}
{39_1}Your daughter's house is larger
now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The child doesn't need as much care now
so they made a room for the two of them.{NextPage_49}
When the neighbors saw {CharName_0}
working hard to build it, they joined in
and helped.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure she'll keep working hard
on the farm.
I'll have to do my best, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0} certainly is a hard worker.{32_3_232}
Now that the child doesn't need as much
attention, she decided to make a nice
bedroom for her spouse.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your daughter is a fine
farmer.{NextPage_1}You'd think I might be retiring soon, but
I still got some good years in me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}They sure grow up fast, don't they?{32_3_232}
----------x----------
{35_2}I wonder what it would be like
to watch your grandchildren grow up...{32_3_232}
Anyway, {CharName_1} is just like
{CharName_0}. Everything from looks
to how they walk are just the same.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
Which means that they look like you
too, I guess.{32_3_232}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} is grown up now.
It's amazing how kids get lives
of their own after a while.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It must be nice to watch your children
grow, but I bet it's a little sad when
they no longer need you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, about the farm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your daughter certainly is a
hard worker.{32_7_208}{NextPage_49}
At first I thought we'd be doing
well just to make ends meet.
But we exceeded expectations.{NextPage_49}
Of course, that makes me busier too.
Well, I'll keep at it as long as I can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We're doing well at the moment.
Your daughter works hard,
I'm glad to say.{NextPage_49}
Her family is just fine and
there's nothing to worry about.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm afraid the farm isn't doing
all that well.{32_7_208}{NextPage_49}
Your daughter seems to enjoy herself
more in places far from our fields.{NextPage_49}
But that's just fine.
Don't you think?
If she enjoys life, that's what matters.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your daughter is quite a bit older.{32_7_208}
So have I, but I'm hanging in there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_73} is young and handsome as ever.
You'd never guess his son to be so old.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That {CharName_1} is a
lot more mature.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think {CharName_1} has succeeded
{CharName_0}...
Maybe I should think about retiring.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{41_2_0}Chase.
Don't chase.
----------x----------
I guess your daughter just wasn't cut out
for life on the farm.{NextPage_49}
But she has to live her own life,
so I guess there's nothing that can
be done about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey!{32_2_188}
----------x----------
Over here!{32_2_188}
----------x----------
Crops won't grow if you plant
them next to fruit trees!{NextPage_49}
Fruit trees are taller than other
plants, so they overshadow them!
Plan carefully next time!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There is a note from Takakura:{NextPage_49}
“Hey, there was somebody who really
wanted to buy that weird crop.{NextPage_49}
They said they want to buy some seeds too.
If you grow any more of those, put them in
this bin. I'll sell them for you.”{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isolate the cow?
{41_2_0}Yes.
No.
----------x----------
Several days later...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It happened so suddenly.
We don't know the cause,
but I'm afraid your child passed away.{NextPage_49}
You didn't come and get her, did you?
If so, your priorities were not in order.
I should have gone first...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your child lived a good life.
She did everything she had to.{NextPage_49}
The farm is successful, her spouse is
well and {CharName_1}...{NextPage_1}Yes, I think your grandchild
has chosen a path in life.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Forget-Me-Not Valley is a little
lonelier, but we're carrying on.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you remember when you first came
here?{32_7_208}
And when was it that I arrived here
with your daughter?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your child followed in your
footsteps. Surely that makes you
happy, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure I'll be there to see you soon
enough. Maybe we three can begin a farm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your grandchild...{32_3_232} decided
to follow in {CharName_0}'s footsteps.{32_3_232}
{CharName_1} is working very hard to{NextPage_49}
learn how to be a farmer.{32_3_232}
He reminds me of {CharName_0} when
I first brought her here.{32_1_244}{NextPage_49}
The spitting image.{32_3_232}
It's almost funny.{32_7_208}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But {CharName_1} was born into
farm life.{32_1_244}
A farming thoroughbred of sorts.{32_3_232}
{CharName_1} may do better than your son.{32_1_244}
Or at least I think so sometimes.{32_7_208}
----------x----------
She might not like me to say that.{32_1_244}
Maybe she'll come back and haunt me...{32_1_244}
That'd be scary...{32_3_232}
I'm sorry, {CharName_0}.
You did a good job too.{32_5_220} ...OK?{32_7_208}
----------x----------
It looks like your grandchild decided
to take over the farm.{32_3_232}
I think {CharName_1} wants to
concentrate on growing crops.{32_7_208}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} will get along with {CharName_38}.{32_3_232}
{CharName_38} complimented {CharName_1}
just the other day.{32_1_244}
{CharName_1} might come up with some
crops even {CharName_0} never grew.{32_7_208}
----------x----------
I have this strange visitor here.{32_3_232}
His name is {CharName_38} and if you
feed him seeds or crops he can turn them
into new varieties.{32_3_232}
{CharName_1} started right off
making all kinds of new crops.{32_7_208}
----------x----------
I can't help but wish {CharName_1}
would spend more time on the animals.{32_3_232}
But...{32_3_232} I guess it's OK.{32_7_208}
----------x----------
I wonder where {CharName_1} got it from,
but your grandchild has a musical talent.{32_15_160}
I've never even heard {CharName_0}
sing a song...{32_7_208}
And you...
Your were quite tone deaf, I recall.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
I can still hear the shrill racket.{32_3_232}
Your voice sounded like an alley cat.{32_7_208}
I bet {CharName_1} got it from {CharName_73}.{32_7_208}{NextPage_49}
Even {CharName_8} was surprised.{32_15_160}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Anyway, {CharName_1} and {CharName_20}
are good friends.{NextPage_49}
They said something about starting a group
and playing “gigs” -- whatever they are.
These kids today...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The two of them said they wanted
as many people as possible to hear their
music, so they went on tour.{NextPage_49}
Since {CharName_1}'s with {CharName_20}...
You have to wonder if we'll see your
grandchild again...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your grandchild was always interested in
art, you know.
{CharName_1} often talked with {CharName_21}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know what {CharName_1} and {CharName_21}
talk about, but I guess {CharName_1} has
all kinds of plans.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} left a note and disappeared
one day. {CharName_73} was terribly
shocked. Well, maybe it's a phase.{32_7_208}
It's not as if I can't understand
{CharName_1}'s feelings...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
After a while, {CharName_73} received
a letter from {CharName_1}.
I guess it's one of those things where you{32_7_208}
“find yourself” or something. I don't
know.{32_7_208}{NextPage_49}
I'm certainly no artist.
..............................
But I guess we have to trust {CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your grandchild decided to work on
developing his athletic skills.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_11} advised {CharName_1} to join
a sports team in the city.{32_7_208}
I heard this from {CharName_12} later,
but it seems {CharName_1} and {CharName_13}
aren't quite at the same athletic level,
and {CharName_11} had to ask the coach to
help out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They played their first match on
TV the other day.{32_3_232}
What was the name of that sport?{NextPage_49}
It's kind of like baseball, but sort of
different, too.{32_3_232}
The pitcher stands next to the batter.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
And when {CharName_1} made what
looked like a great hit, they said it was
a “foul.” I don't get it.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
Oh yes, they call it Pesapallo,
I think.{32_3_232}
They ended up losing that match, but{NextPage_49}
with your grandchild on the team I'm
sure they'll finish strong this season.{32_7_208}
Perhaps I'm slightly biased.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That grandchild of yours certainly does
like to study. “Books, books, books.”
That's what {CharName_73} always says.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes {CharName_1} goes to {CharName_19}'s
lab and helps out with his experiments.{32_3_232}
Or maybe {CharName_1} was being
experimented on. It's hard to tell.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Anyway, now {CharName_1}
wants to go to college in the city.{32_5_220}{NextPage_1}{CharName_73}worried about money,
but your grandkid got a scholarship!
Money is no longer a problem.{32_5_220}
Things turned out rather nicely.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh yes, I received a letter from
{CharName_1} the other day.{32_3_232}
{CharName_1}'s doing robotics.{32_7_208}
Sometimes I think {CharName_19} influenced{32_1_244}
{CharName_1} with his experiments.{32_1_244}{NextPage_49}
I'm always a little worried that we'll
have another mad scientist on our hands.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
To tell you the truth, I always thought I
would see you first and we could watch
over the farm together. But no...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now that your grandchild has taken
over the farm, I can finally retire
in peace.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_73} is still doing
well, after all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}I'm sure they will keep the farm
going as father and son.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
You and your daughter better keep an
eye on them from up there.{32_11_184}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
To tell you the truth, I always thought I
would see you first and we could watch
over the farm together. But no...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_73} says he will continue the
farm in your son's memory.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought I might be able to retire soon,
but I guess I still have some work to do.{32_3_232}
I can't let {CharName_73} work the farm all
by himself, after all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
    ...Several days later...   {32_3_232}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}It all started with a letter...{NextPage_49}
I hadn't gotten a letter in a
long time...{NextPage_49}
{35_2}It was in a bright red envelope {32_3_232}
and it was from the daughter of an
old friend.{NextPage_49}
{35_2}{32_5_220}She wrote about her life in the city{32_3_232}
and asked all kinds of questions about
the farm.{NextPage_49}
On the last line,{32_1_44}
she said this...{NextPage_49}
{35_2}{32_1_244}“I want to {32_1_244}try working on the farm.”{NextPage_49}
{35_2}{32_1_44}To a city girl,{32_1_44} a place like Forget-Me-Not
Valley must be interesting, I guess.{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
{35_2}{32_1_44}While I was thinking that,{32_1_244}
I was reminded{32_2_188} of my old friend. {32_1_44}
Of his face.{32_0_100}.{32_0_100}.{32_0_100}.{32_0_100}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}      ...Several days later...      {NextPage_49}
{35_2}...So that's how
her life on the farm began.{NextPage_49}
{35_2}I figured she would either get tired
or like it and stay.{NextPage_49}
{35_2}In the end, the choice was hers to make{32_0_200}.{32_1_144}.{32_2_188}.{32_2_188}{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cut it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
...?!{32_3_32}
----------x----------
{36_1}               {_28}{_04}{32_11_184}
----------x----------
{36_1}                  {_28}{05_50}{_0b}~
----------x----------
{36_1}                {_28}{_06}{32_11_184}
----------x----------
{36_1}                 {_28}{_07}{32_11_184}
----------x----------
{36_1}                 {_28}{_08}{32_11_184}
----------x----------
{36_1}                 {_28}{_09}{32_11_184}
----------x----------
{36_1}                  {_28}{_0a}{32_11_184}
----------x----------
You can't enter while holding an item.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{41_2_0}Follow.
Don't follow.
----------x----------
It looks like there is something
else that she wants to do with her life.{NextPage_49}
But she has to live her own life,
so I guess there's nothing that can
be done about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?{32_7_208} Am I worried about her?{32_3_232}
She'll be fine...
After all, she's your daughter.{32_11_184}{31}
I'm sure she'll find her own path
eventually.{32_3_232}
Just like you found farming for
yourself.{32_11_184}{31}
----------x----------
     ...A few years later...   {32_7_208}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How are you doing, old friend?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I guess you don't have to worry
about as many things where you are.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When {CharName_73} married your
daughter,{32_3_232}
the farm wasn't in the best of shape,
to say the least...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But {CharName_21} and the others
helped build a nice kitchen.{NextPage_49}
I guess they didn't have enough time
to worry about decorating it, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But {CharName_29} helped build a nice
kitchen for her sister-in-law.{NextPage_49}
I guess she didn't have enough time
to worry about decorating it, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But {CharName_24} and the others
helped build a nice kitchen.{NextPage_49}
I guess they didn't have enough time
to worry about decorating it, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your daughter's working hard.
The farm's doing fine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They built a nice kitchen.
And {CharName_20} seems very happy
enjoying your daughter's cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They built a nice kitchen.
And {CharName_30} seems very happy
enjoying your daughter's cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They built a nice kitchen.
And {CharName_26} seems very happy
enjoying your daughter's cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your grandchild is starting to talk now.
They're very cute at this age.
What was that name they chose...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}...{32_3_232}
{35_1}Oh yes, the name was {CharName_1}.{35_0}
The spitting image of {CharName_73}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All parents have hopes for their children.
I wonder what they have in mind
for their child?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your grandchild is a lot bigger.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, and {52_0_0_0}
{39_32} expanded the house.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The boy helps around the house.
Well, sometimes anyway...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Anyway, I look forward to the future.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}{CharName_1} is quite mischievous
right now. You were probably just the
same at that age.{32_39_16}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} seems to want to
imitate everything {CharName_0} does.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}'s a quiet, gentle child.
Like {CharName_0}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} seems to want to
imitate everything {CharName_0} does.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
She must really love that kid.
She worked for years to make a nice
children's bedroom.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure they'll work hard at
the farm from now on.
I'll have to do my best, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Work on the farm seems to be going well
and they've even added on a child's room.{NextPage_49}
When children get older, they need
a room of their own, after all...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your daughter's really starting to
act like a mother.{NextPage_49}
It makes me feel old
though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} grows taller all the time.
Reminds me of you when
you were that age.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Children may not always
turn out as their parents hope.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}But {CharName_1} looks quite
healthy.
That's the important thing.{32_11_184}
----------x----------
Who's that, you ask?{32_3_232}
It's that young scoundrel...{32_3_232}
{CharName_1}.
{CharName_0}'s kid.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} is at a difficult stage. You
know, when one rebels against everything.
Don't you remember feeling that way?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Who's that, you ask?{32_3_232}
Why, it's...{32_3_232}
{CharName_1}.
{CharName_0}'s kid.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} is at a difficult stage.
Adolescence. Between boy and man.
Do you remember that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, and look closely.{52_0_0_0}
{39_1}Your daughter's house is larger
now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The boy doesn't need as much attention now
so they made a room for the two of them.{NextPage_49}
When the neighbors saw {CharName_0}
working hard to build it, they joined in
and helped.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure she'll keep working hard
on the farm.
I'll have to do my best, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0} certainly is a hard worker.{32_3_232}
Now that the child doesn't need as much
attention, she decided to make a nice
bedroom for her and her husband.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your daughter has become a fine farmer.
You'd think I might be retiring soon,
but I won't just yet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}They sure grow up fast, don't they?{32_3_232}
----------x----------
{35_2}I wonder what it would be like
to watch your grandchildren grow up.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
Anyway, {CharName_1} is just like
{CharName_0}. Everything from the looks
to how they walk are just the same.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
Which means that they look like you
too, I guess.{32_3_232}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}'s grown up
now. It's amazing how kids get lives
of their own after a while...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It must be nice to watch your children
grow, but I bet it's a little sad when
they no longer need you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, about the farm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your daughter is certainly a
hard worker.{32_7_208}
At first I thought we'd be doing
well just to make ends meet,
but we're doing very well.{NextPage_49}
Of course, that makes me busier too...
Well, I'll keep at it as long as I can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We're doing well at the moment.
Your daughter is working hard,
I'm glad to say.{NextPage_49}
Her family is just fine and
there's nothing to worry about.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm afraid the farm isn't doing
all that well...{32_7_208}
Your daughter seems to enjoy
herself more far away from the fields.{NextPage_49}
But that's just fine.
Don't you think?
If she enjoys life, that matters most.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your daughter is quite a bit older.{32_7_208}
So am I, but I'm hanging in there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_73} is as young looking as ever.
You'd never guess his child is that old.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That {CharName_1} is more mature.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think {CharName_1} finally
succeeded {CharName_0} as a farmer.
Maybe I should think about retiring.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Several days later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It happened so suddenly.
We still don't know the cause.
I'm afraid your daughter passed away.{NextPage_49}
You didn't come and get her did you?
If so, you were confused.
I should have gone first.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But your daughter lived a good life.
She did everything successfully.{NextPage_49}
The farm is still going and her husband
is well. And your grandchild seems to
have chosen what to do in life.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Forget-Me-Not Valley is a little
lonelier, but we're carrying on.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you remember when you first came
here?{32_7_208}
And when was it that I arrived here
with your daughter?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your child followed in your
footsteps. Surely that makes you
happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure I'll be there to see you soon
enough. Perhaps we will all start a farm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your grandchild {32_3_232} decided
to follow in {CharName_0}'s footsteps.{32_3_232}
{CharName_1} is working very hard to{NextPage_49}
learn how to be a farmer.{32_3_232}
Reminds me of {CharName_0} when
I first brought her here.{32_1_244}{NextPage_49}
The spitting image.{32_3_232}
It's almost funny.{32_7_208}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But {CharName_1} was born into
farm life.{32_1_244}
A farming thoroughbred of sorts.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
{CharName_1} may outdo your daughter.{32_1_244}
Or at least I think so sometimes.{32_7_208}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
She might not like me to say that.{32_1_244}
Maybe she'll come back and haunt me...{32_1_244}
That'd be scary.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
I'm sorry, {CharName_0}.
You did a good job too.{32_5_220} OK?{32_7_208}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks like your grandchild decided
to take over the farm.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
I think {CharName_1} wants to
concentrate on growing crops.{32_7_208}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}'ll get along with {CharName_38}.{32_3_232}
{CharName_38} complimented {CharName_1}
just the other day.{32_1_244}
{CharName_1} should come up with some
crops that even {CharName_0} never grew.{32_7_208}
----------x----------
I have this strange visitor.{32_3_232}
His name is {CharName_38} and if you
feed him seeds or crops he can turn them{NextPage_49}
into new varieties.{32_3_232}
{CharName_1} started right off
making all kinds of new crops.{32_7_208}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't help but wish {CharName_1}'d
spend a little more time on the animals.{32_3_232}
But...{32_3_232} I guess it's OK...{32_7_208}
----------x----------
I wonder where {CharName_1} got it from,
but your grandchild has musical talent.{32_15_160}{NextPage_49}
I've never even heard {CharName_0}
sing a song.{32_7_208}{NextPage_49}
And you...
Your were quite tone deaf, weren't you?{32_3_232}
I can still hear your din.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
Your voice sounded like an alley cat.{32_7_208}
I bet {CharName_1} got it from {CharName_73}.
Even {CharName_8} was surprised.{32_15_160}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Anyway, {CharName_1} and {CharName_20}
have become fast friends.
They said something about starting a group
and playing “gigs” -- whatever that is.
Kids today...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The two of them said they wanted
as many people as possible to hear their
music, so they went off on tour.
Since {CharName_1}'s with {CharName_20}...
You have to wonder if we'll see your
grandchild again...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} takes after {CharName_20}.
{CharName_1} does have a musical talent.{32_15_160}
I've never even heard {CharName_0} sing
a song.{32_7_208}{NextPage_49}
And you...
Your were quite tone deaf, weren't you?{32_3_232}
I can still hear the din.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
Your voice sounded like an alley cat.{32_7_208}
{CharName_1}'s singing voice surprised
even {CharName_8}.{32_15_160}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} often sang
with {CharName_20}...
They even had a concert together.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} said he wanted to bring
music to as many as people as possible
and so went on tour.
You have to wonder if we'll see your
grandchild again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your grandchild was always interested in
art, you know.
{CharName_1} often talked with {CharName_21}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know what {CharName_1} and {CharName_21}
talk about, but I guess {CharName_1} has
all kinds of plans.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} left a note and
disappeared one day. {CharName_73} was terribly
shocked. Maybe it's a phase.{32_7_208}{NextPage_49}
It's not as if I can't understand
{CharName_1}'s feelings.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
After a while, {CharName_73} received
a letter from {CharName_1}.
I guess it's one of those things where you{32_7_208}
“find yourself” or something. I don't
know...{32_7_208}
I'm no artist.
..............................
I guess we have to trust {CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your grandchild has decided to work on
developing athletic skills.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_11} advised {CharName_1} to join
a sports team in the city.{32_7_208}{NextPage_49}
I heard this from {CharName_12} later,
but it seems {CharName_1} and {CharName_13}
aren't quite at the same athletic level,{NextPage_49}
and {CharName_11} had to ask the coach to
help out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They played their first match on
television the other day.{32_3_232}
What was the name of that sport.{NextPage_49}
It's kind of like baseball, but sort of
different, too.{32_3_232}
The pitcher stands next to the batter.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
And when {CharName_1} made what
looked like a great hit, they said it was
a “foul.” I don't get it.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
Oh yes, they call it Pesapallo,
I think.{32_3_232}
They ended up losing that match, but{NextPage_49}
with your grandchild on the team, I'm
sure they'll end up being very strong.{32_7_208}
Or maybe I'm just biased.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That grandchild of yours certainly does
like to study. “Books, books, books.”
That's what {CharName_73} always says.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes {CharName_1} goes to {CharName_19}'s
lab and helps out with his experiments.{32_3_232}
Or maybe {CharName_1} was being experimented
on. It's hard to tell.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Anyway, {CharName_1} wante
to go to college in the city.{32_5_220}
{CharName_73} worried about the money,{NextPage_49}
but {CharName_1} received
a special scholarship! No money needed.{32_5_220}
That's pretty impressive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh yes, I received a letter from
{CharName_1} the other day.{32_3_232}
{CharName_1} studies robotics.{32_7_208}
Sometimes I think {CharName_19} influenced{32_1_244}
{CharName_1} with his experiments.{32_1_244}{NextPage_49}
I'm always a little worried that we'll
have another mad scientist on our hands.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
To tell you the truth, I always thought I
would see you first and we could watch
over the farm together. But no.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now that your grandchild has taken
over the farm, I can finally retire
in peace.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_73} is still doing
well, after all...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}I'm sure they will keep the farm
going as father and child.{32_3_232}
You and your daughter had better keep an
eye on them from up there.{32_11_184}
----------x----------
To tell you the truth, I always thought I
would see you first and we could watch
over the farm together. But no...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_73} says he will continue the
farm in your daughter's memory.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought I might be able to retire soon,
but I guess I still have some work to do.{32_3_232}
I can't let {CharName_73} work the farm all
by himself, after all.{NextPage_0}
