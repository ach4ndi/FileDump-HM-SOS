\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f48\u2135What nice weather\u2328we're having today.
\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f48\u2135Oh, \u232a.\u2328How's the farm?\u232bI hear things are\u2328going well.
\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f49\u2135That's splendid.\u232bIt warms my heart to see\u2328all these new people and\u2328animals in the village.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f48\u2135So, \u232a, have you\u2328heard about the meaning\u2328behind this statue?
\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f48\u2135This statue represents\u2328our village, you see.\u232bUnlike Konohana Village,\u2328we focus on livestock.\u232bThat's why our symbol\u2328is an animal.
\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f49\u2135So have you figured out\u2328the major difference\u2328between our two villages?
\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f48\u2135As I'm sure you know, we\u2328focus on raising livestock.\u232bThat's why our symbol\u2328is an animal.
\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f49\u2135I'm sure you've come to see\u2328the strengths and weaknesses\u2328of both villages.
\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f48\u2135Anyway, I should be going.\u2328Bye, \u232a.
