What the--! {CharName_27}!
You can't just leave your bar like that!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How could someone so much younger
than me be taken first?{32_19_136}{NextPage_49}
{50_22_0_0}All right!
I'm gonna go home and set off my
best firecracker, just for him!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27},
a song for him, if
you please!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll be headin' for bed soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's my shut-eye time, so
get out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've gotta be leavin' soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've gotta go now.
Bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Hey...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Hey there youngster.
Got a second?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_9}Hmph. Nothin' here.
All sold out, are you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}..Oh well.
Maybe I'll come back later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Don't mind me.
I'm just lookin'.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}Is this all you have?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wouldn't mind having
the {29_0}, but how much is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
Not a bad price.
I like the cut of your jib, son.
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see... Well, all right.
I suppose I'll take it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, never mind then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh never mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Welcome to Forget-Me-Not Valley. Name's
Kassey. I'm the best fireworks maker in
the world. Met my brother Patrick yet?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_7}...........Hmmmmm....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_7}.............
Just leave me alone,
youngster...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_108}{50_22_0_4}What?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_108}{50_22_0_4}What do you want?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Mornin'.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Howdy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Evenin'.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Evenin'.
What are you doin' out at
this hour?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Howdy.
What are you doin' out so late?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Howdy. I won't tell you any of my
firework secrets, so don't ask.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}You have some business out this late?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Howdy.
What can I do for you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_3}What, is that for me? To tell you the
truth, that's one of my favorites.
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}Well, thank you, thank you.
You're not a bad young feller, are you?
I'm lookin' forward to eatin' this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_4}Listen here, you young whippersnapper!
{50_22_0_9}Oh never mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}That looks good. I'm droolin' all
over myself just lookin' at it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}You have somethin' nice there.
{50_22_0_3}What, is it for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}That's one of my weaknesses.
Right after young women, that is...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_108}{50_22_0_4}Get that stuff out of my face!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_108}{50_22_0_7}Just lookin' at that makes
me sick to my stomach...
{50_22_0_9}Ugh...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_9}What is that?
Nothin' I'd want, that's for sure.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_4}Don't you have anythin'
better to show me? {50_22_0_3}Like a picture of a
nice young... er... never mind...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_9}...I'm sorry, but
I'm really not very fond
of children.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_9}............
I don't understand what people
see in those things...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_9}......Look,
I think some animals are cute, but
I wouldn't say I actually like them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_9}They're a lot of work, and they
smell... I don't know why people feel the
need to have pets...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_9}What kind of seed is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Good luck with your
plantin' and all...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Hmm. Did you grow that?
It looks pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}That looks pretty good.
Why don't you try growin' lots of things?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Hmm. Is that from your farm?
It looks very nice and
fresh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Hmmm.
That looks like it would be
very healthy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}Did you catch that fish?
I see. You fish too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}You like fishin'?
I prefer playin' my game.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}Did you pick that?
I heard those are good in cookin'.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}You like collectin' wild plants?
I prefer playin' my game.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}That's a tasty lookin' dish you have.
{50_22_0_3}What, are you givin' it to me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}Yes... Looks quite good.
I love that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_9}Is that a good hoe?
{50_22_0_3}I'm really only interested in pretty girls
and fireworks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_108}{50_22_0_9}Don't you use a hoe for
tillin' a field?
What're you doin' with it here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Tools get easier to use the
more you use them. Did you know that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_9}Is that a good sickle?
{50_22_0_3}I'm really only interested in pretty girls
and fireworks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_108}{50_22_0_9}Isn't a sickle used for
cuttin' grass and stuff?
You shouldn't wave it around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_9}Hmm. A waterin' can, eh?
Even if we had a fire with our fireworks
this wouldn't put it out...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_108}By the way...
Don't spill any water around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_12}What on earth is that thing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_3}Oh! So you use that to
milk!
{50_22_0_9}...Oh, it only works on cows, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_9}Clippers, eh?
Don't have any use for those.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Maybe we could make a rule where
if somebody loses my game, he has to shave
his head... What do you think?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}You can finish your work much more
quickly if you use your tools well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_12}Oh! What do we have here?
{50_22_0_3}Are you gonna give it to me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_12}I don't know what it is,
but I like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Hmm.
Is that wild plant from around here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Hmm.
I don't know anythin' about wild plants.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_12}Hmm. What's that?
A dog disk?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}I know!
It's a dart board, right? But it's kind of
plain and doesn't have the scores on it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_12}Hmm. What's that, youngster?
Does it have somethin' to do with me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_12}Hmm. What's that?
Somethin' rare?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Hmm. That's one of Patrick's fireworks.
Still needs work... But it's better
than most fireworks you see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Hmm. Not a bad firecracker.
But of course, you never really
know until you set it off...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that for me?
{50_22_0_9}{34_1_109}It isn't?!
{50_22_0_4}You young son of a gun!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Who're you givin' that to?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}My twin brother and I live in an elevated
house. We both make fireworks.
I'm the older one, just so you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}I don't like to toot my own horn,
but I come from a long line of fireworks
makers. I'm the best.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}To tell you the truth, my brother and I
were once workin' on a 7-foot tall
firecracker when it went off and well...{NextPage_49}
We landed here and have
been livin' in this place ever since.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}That thing you gave me
was very good.
You're all right, young un'.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_9}About that thing you gave me...
I just can't stand that kind of thing.
Sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_9}The {29_0} you gave me
wasn't great.
You've still got work to do...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}The {29_0} you gave me
was pretty good.
I wouldn't mind some more...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}The {29_0} you gave me
was the best darn thing I ever tasted!
You're amazin'!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}The {29_0} you gave me
was just the kind of thing I like.
Yep, it was delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_9}That milk you gave me
tasted a little off to me...
You've still got work to do...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}That milk you gave me
wasn't bad.
I wouldn't mind some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}That milk you gave me
was pretty darn good.
Thanks a lot. I'd love some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}That milk you gave me
was just incredible.
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_9}That milk you gave me
seemed kind of...
smelly.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}That milk you gave me
was pretty darn good.
Maybe a little smelly.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}The cheese you gave me
was pretty darn good.
Thanks a lot. I'd love some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}The cheese you gave me
was from your farm, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}The butter you gave me
was pretty darn good.
Thanks a lot. I'd love some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}The butter you gave me
was from your farm, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}That dish you gave me
was pretty darn good.
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}That fish you gave me
was pretty darn good.
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}That wild plant you gave me
was pretty darn good.
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}That what-cha-ma-call-it you gave me
was pretty darn lip-smackin' good.
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}You're workin' hard every day.
Aside from a few rare geniuses like me,
most people'd have trouble doin' so well.{NextPage_49}
You're a fine farmer.
Well done.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}I heard you're good at growin' things.
Aside from a few rare geniuses like me,
most people'd have trouble doin' so well.{NextPage_49}
Keep up the good work, and keep
growin' lots of tasty crops.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}I heard you're a very good cook.{NextPage_49}
Aside from a few rare geniuses like me,
most people'd have trouble doin' so well.{NextPage_49}
Keep it up. You'll be a top chef one day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Are you workin' hard?
A genius like myself may be the exception,
but for most, success requires hard work.{NextPage_49}
Anyway, things seem to be workin'
out well for you on your farm, so
keep up the good work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}You're sure workin' hard on those crops.
A genius like myself may be the exception,
but for most, success requires hard work.{NextPage_49}
Farming's a noble profession.
Keep at it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}I hear you cook a lot at home.
People say you're pretty good at it.{NextPage_49}
A genius like myself may be the exception,
but for most, success requires hard work.
Keep workin' on it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Used to life on the farm, are you?
{34_1_109}Now your real work begins.
You're still young, so keep at it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Used to growin' crops, have you?
{34_1_109}You're still young. You should
do what you think you're suited for.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Used to cookin', are you?
{34_1_109}You're still young. You should
do what you think you're suited for.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Hey there, young un'. Which do you like
better, fireworks or girls?
{41_3_1}Fireworks.
Girls.
Both.
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}So you like fireworks, eh?
I'd like to show you mine sometime.
{50_22_0_9}But not now.{NextPage_49}
I'm in the middle of my research.
{50_22_0_3}And you should really think about
gettin' interested in girls, too. Heh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_12}I thought so!
{50_22_0_3}Yep, you've got that look about you.
Just try and keep yourself under control.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_12}Both?!{50_22_0_3}You're quite a kid!
You know what fireworks and girls have in
common? The pretty ones are the best! Ha!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_108}{50_22_0_4}Don't talk to me while I'm
makin' fireworks. Even the tiniest mistake
and BOOM!!.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_108}{50_22_0_4}Don't touch anythin' over there.
One wrong move and BOOM!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_108}If you beat one of us at our game,
you'd better be careful.
One wrong move and BOOM!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_108}When I'm in a bad mood, you'd
better be careful what you say.
One wrong move and BOOM!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_108}When your wife are in a bad mood, you'd
better be careful.
One wrong move and BOOM!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_108}{50_22_0_4}The bar here is a little too
high for my brother and I to use...
Who do I complain to? Mumble mumble...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}My favorite drink is the {13}Moomoo Milk{17}.
I bet you can figure out why...
Ha, ha, ha!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Griffin is usually quiet and
serious, but put a guitar in his hands
and watch out!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Well, make yourself at home.
Of course, there's nothin' to do here
but play our game.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Relax.
Take a load off.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}This place is real relaxin'.
I love it here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}You like this place, too?
Hmm. I see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}This time of year makes
me feel good.
I feel like havin' a party.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Yep. This time of year is just perfect
for enjoyin' nature. The flowers,
the trees... the women...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}One of the best things about my
game is that you can enjoy it year round,
no matter what the weather's like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_9}What kind of firecracker should I make
next... {34_1_110}{50_22_0_3} Aha! Somethin' that'll be popular
with the ladies! Now what'd Muffy like?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_9}Whew... I don't care what they say...
It's the heat AND the humidity.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}But I think this time of year
is the best one for settin' off
fireworks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}Not too hot, not too cold.
Isn't this the best time of year?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_3}It's so cool this time of year.
It really helps the old appetite.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}{50_22_0_9}Darn winter...
It's so cold.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}This time of year is perfect for
relaxin' in a hot tub with some pretty
ladies, but that's not gonna happen here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}I love the sea.
Don't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Lookin' out at this expanse of blue ocean,
I can't help but think of fireworks...
What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}All right.
How about playin' a game?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_110}Don't hold back.
I'm ready for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_108}{50_22_0_4}Hmph. You won't play, eh?
{50_22_0_9}Go on then, run away with
your tail between your legs!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_109}{50_22_0_12}Sorry, could you make it some other time?
I've got my hands full at the moment.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It sure is damp.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_108}{50_22_0_4}On days like this, the gunpowder
gets wet, so I can't do a thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}I'm sorry, but your time is up.
I win this time.{NextPage_49}
It's good to be careful about your moves,
but if you take too long, this can happen.
Next game, pay more attention to the time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}Too bad.
I win this time.
Hmm. Maybe I tried a little too hard?{NextPage_49}
No, just kiddin'.
I hope you'll come and play me
again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}Hmm. That was a close one.
I win this time.
I'll be waitin' for a rematch.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_12}What?!
I lose this time.
{50_22_0_3}Ho ho ho.{NextPage_49}
You got me good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_7}Darn!
I lost this time.
{50_22_0_3}You're pretty good, youngin'.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}Ho ho ho.
This time it's a tie.{NextPage_49}
You're pretty good, youngin'.
Let's play again sometime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
In honor of your victory, let me
give you this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love to play again sometime,
youngster.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_0}Next time things'll be different.
I'll be wantin' a rematch sooner or
later, so be ready for me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How is your wife doin'?
I'm so jealous. Imagine, living with
such a pretty wife!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you know why our house is so high?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I see. But I bet you didn't know
why our house looks a lot like
a rocket.{NextPage_49}
That way, when we do have a big explosion,
our whole house'll go with us!
Not a bad idea, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's to protect the fireworks from
moisture.
Pretty clever, eh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Fireworks and women are a lot alike.
You have to handle them both gently
and with a lot of care.{NextPage_49}
And if you make even the tiniest
mistake... KABOOM!
But they both sure are pretty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}This is my day off!
I'm takin' it easy!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_1}I have to take a rest sometime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If fireworks are like women, then Cody's
pieces of art are like men.{NextPage_49}
His artwork is so strong, so
full of power. Just like men.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My creations are big, loud and bright
when they're revealed to the world, even
if the process of making them is borin'.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But his work is so plain.
I'm afraid the average person just
can't understand Cody's art.{NextPage_0}
