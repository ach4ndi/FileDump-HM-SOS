Oh{u_0086}{2d} you came just at the
right time!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well{u_0086}{2d} I was looking at the river
when I saw a bottle come
floating by.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I fished it out of the river and
opened it{u_0086}{2d} and there was a
message inside.{NextPage_49}
It was a recipe of some kind!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was really surprised when I 
tried making it!{NextPage_49}
It was incredibly delicious!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The person who came up with
this recipe would make a
great wife............{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So I was wondering{u_0086}{2d} could you
find the owner of this bottle
for me?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Sure.
How about doing it yourself?
----------x----------
Really? That would be great.
Thank you!
Well then... Uh...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{_2e}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well then{u_0086}{2d} {_2e}{u_0086}{2d}
Take this letter from the
bottle.{NextPage_49}
The only clue I can give you
is that they're somewhere
upstream. Good luck!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hm...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why{u_0086}{2d} you're holding the
bottle that I put in the river.{NextPage_0}

for a second?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No question about it.
I wrote this recipe{u_0086}{2d} too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

You see..........
.............................
        So that's what happened.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see... Really?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's right!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But why did you throw the
bottle in the river in the
        first place?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love cooking. But all the
fishermen around here are
terrible cooks.{NextPage_49}
So I thought I might secretly
give them some cooking tips.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see.{NextPage_49}
He seemed to really like
        that recipe of yours.{NextPage_0}
