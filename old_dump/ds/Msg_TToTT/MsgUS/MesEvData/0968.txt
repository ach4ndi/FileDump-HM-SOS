\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Oh my, this plant...!
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136It was just a bud two days\u2328ago.\u232bNow it's simply enormous!\u2328Fascinating!\u232bPresumably, then, this is a\u2328favorable environment?\u2328Or could it be...
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136*sigh*\u2328How did it get so late?
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f4c\u2136Sorry, \u232a.\u232bOnce I get wrapped up in\u2328studying plants, I lose\u2328track of everything else...
\u2332 Not a problem.\u2328 Not my idea of fun.
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136I'm so relieved to hear you\u2328say that. I'm sorry I\u2328dragged you along today.\u232bBut thanks to you, I made an\u2328interesting discovery.\u2328...Well, gotta go.
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f4a\u2136I'm no fun, I guess.\u232bBut if you were bored, why\u2328didn't you just go home,\u2328then?\u232bThat's what I'm gonna do...\u2328go home.\u2328So goodbye, \u232a.
