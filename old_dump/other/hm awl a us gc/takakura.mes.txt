If a woman doesn't have a man to protect

The other day I saw something called a
“Seed Maker” on sale in the city.{NextPage_49}
Apparently it can make seeds out of crops.
I can get one if you order it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey!{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
It's about time for the Miracle Potion.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey!{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
We're going to start the Miracle Potion,
so come to the {Location_43_20_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Will you wait outside while I give the
Miracle Potion to her? I don't want
her to get nervous.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't worry...{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
It's OK...{NextPage_49}
....................................{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
All right.{32_3_232}
It's over.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't worry...{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
It's OK...{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
....................................{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
All right.{32_3_232}

It's OK.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
....................................{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
All right.{32_3_232}
It's over.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't worry...{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
{34_1_54}Hmmm...
It's OK...{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
....................................{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
{34_1_55}Good!
That did it!{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
....................................{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
All right.{32_3_232}
It's over.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
She should be pregnant within a few days.
Keep a close eye on her.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
Well, then...{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
I'll put these two back where they were,
so you can get back to your work.{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
{34_1_55}Hey!{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
Got a minute?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_55}Hey!{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
Come to the {Location_43_20_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When she is about ready to give birth,
you have to isolate her.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
To do that you need the “Isolation Fence.”{NextPage_1}It's in the {Location_43_23_23}.{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
I isolated her this time, but you'll need
to do it from now on.{NextPage_49}
Talk to your cow, and when you think she
needs to be isolated, go get the fence
from the {Location_43_23_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_55}Hey! I've got a new animal with me!{32_3_32}{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
Here's the new animal.
Give it a name.{NextPage_1}And decide where to put the feed box.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The horse I ordered has arrived.
No, don't worry. I ordered him on
my own. Think of it as a gift.{NextPage_49}
Give him a name.{NextPage_1}And decide where his feedbox should go.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Input_128}... That's a good name.{32_3_32}{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
Take good care of it.{32_3_32}{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
Here's the new animal.
Give it a name.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Excuse me, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, this is the first
time you're leaving the house, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The young lady...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well then, I'll just...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, I have to talk to you
about shipping some things...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{33_0}{u_00c8}..........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, by the way, what should
{CharName_26} call you, {CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, by the way, what should
{CharName_20} call you, {CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, by the way, what should
{CharName_30} call you, {CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_56}Hey, it ate it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I got back from the city, I found a
bag with a seed in it in my pocket...{NextPage_49}
There was a letter attached that said,
“Please take care of Tartan for us.”{NextPage_49}
I just tried planting him, and this...
thing appeared.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, how do you know my name?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He's pretty big but he looks harmless...{NextPage_49}
Shall we keep him here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Moving something so big is tricky.
Let's wait a while.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_55}Hey,
I just saw a {13}Blue Feather{17} on the
{Location_43_3_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, isn't that a {13}Blue Feather{17}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are quite rare.
Where did you buy it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's an old custom in these parts.
If a man gives a {13}Blue Feather{17} to
a girl, it means he wants to marry her.{NextPage_49}
If the girl accepts the feather and they
get married, they live happily ever after.{NextPage_49}
I sometimes see them being sold for very
high prices in the city, but here? No.
You're very lucky to find one.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_55}It sure is early...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll be going now...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Selling {Input_128}, eh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The Miracle Potion for {Input_128}
will be done when I get back,
so wait a bit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Selling {Input_128}, eh?{NextPage_1}The Miracle Potion for {Input_129}
will be done when I get back,
so wait a bit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, Miracle Potion, eh?
That'll have to wait until I get home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Selling {Input_128}, eh?
The Miracle Potion will be after I get back.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK {Input_128}, let's go.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We're selling this one, huh?.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_56}Hmm...
This one is sick.
I can't take it with me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_55}Hmm? {Input_128}...
I think she's pregnant...
We can't sell her like this...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_56}Hmm...
This one's sick.
Can't do Miracle Potion then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_55}Hmm? {Input_128}...
I think she's pregnant...
No need for Miracle Potion then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_56}Hmm...
This one's sick.
We'll have to wait until they're better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_56}Hmm...
This one's sick.
Can't do the M.P. service then...{NextPage_49}
We'll have to wait until they're better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_56}Hmm...
This one's sick.
We can't sell them like this...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_56}Hmm...
This one's sick.
We can't sell them like this...{NextPage_49}
We'll have to wait until they're better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_54}Nothing today...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_55}Good morning.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nothing today...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_55}Hmm? {Input_128}
isn't doing too well...
Can't take it with me like this...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_56}Hmm? {Input_128}
isn't doing too well...
Can't take it with me like this...{NextPage_49}
We need to find a cure.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_55}Hey there...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whew...{32_1_244}
----------x----------
I'll put the money here, so come
and get it later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The things that wouldn't fit on the {Location_43_3_23}
I put here, so come get them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Anyway...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmmm, won't fit...
Oh well...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey! I'm back!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_55}Hey...
I'll put the money in this can, so{NextPage_1}come and get it later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now then...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The things that wouldn't fit on the
{Location_43_3_23} are in that package,
so come get them.{NextPage_49}
Anyway...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's no point in your staying here
if you don't like farm work.{NextPage_49}
Why don't you find some kind of work
that suits you better?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The pasture seems to be in good shape...{32_7_208}
----------x----------
You're just in time.
I was just telling your kid about
the pasture.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So that's what it's all about.
Do you mind if we talk some more?{32_3_232}
{41_2_0}Oh sure, go ahead.
No, sorry.
----------x----------
Well, why don't we talk a little stroll
over there while we talk?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your kid seems to like dairy
farming.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess your mom has some business to take
care of. We'll finish this later.{NextPage_1}I guess your dad has some business to take
care of. We'll finish this later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your kid seems to like dairy
farming.
You're raising them well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've never seen a crop like that, but...{NextPage_1}I guess I'll show it to people and see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, there was somebody who really
wanted to buy that weird crop.{NextPage_49}
They said they want to buy some seeds too.
If you grow any more of those, put them in
this bin. I'll sell them for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Imagine a young girl wanting to come
to Forget-Me-Not Valley... {32_2_188}You're a
strange one, just like your father.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Anyway...{32_1_244}If you try living here,{32_1_44}
you'll find out if it's for you or not.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Here we are...{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}They're a little old, but the buildings
are still usable, and there are fields.{35_0}{NextPage_49}
{35_2}And if you spread a little fertilizer
in this pasture, it could be used for
grazing animals...{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Let me tell you... we don't have any of
your city conveniences around here.{NextPage_49}
{35_2}But,{32_3_32} it'll grow on you.{32_3_32}
There are lots of things here that you'd
never see in the city.{32_5_220} It's up to you.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}All right, let's look inside.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}This is the {Location_43_20_23}.{32_1_244}
You can keep cows, {32_1_244}horses, {32_1_244}and sheep here.
I'll show you the inside later.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Next door is the {Location_43_23_23}.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}There are shelves for tools and other
things in here. Feel free to use the
tools in here.{35_0}{NextPage_53}
{31}
{35_0}{35_2}The tools you will need right away are on{35_0}{35_1}
{35_0}{35_2}the {Location_43_48_23}, and some crops seeds are{35_0}{35_1}
{35_0}{35_2}on the {Location_43_3_23} too. Come and get them.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}This is the {Location_43_24_23}. Put milk, eggs,
and other things you want to sell in here.
I'll take them to the city the next day.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}If there's anything you want me to buy
for you, there's an {Location_121_168_154}er Form{17} here,
so just write it down.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}This is the {Location_43_21_23}.
You can raise chickens here.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}It looks like we have some stray dogs
here. They seem to like you.{35_0}{NextPage_49}
{35_2}.{32_1_44}.{32_1_244}.{32_1_244}.{32_1_244}Oh, all right.
But I'm not too fond of dogs, so
just one, OK?{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Which one do you want to keep?{35_0}
{41_2_0}The pointy-eared one.
The floppy-eared one.
----------x----------
{35_2}OK, why don't you pick out a name for him?{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}All right. I'll find an owner for the
other one in the city.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}I'll make a dog house for him
later, too.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}And this is your house.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}I've fixed it up a bit, so you can
move right in.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Oh...{32_1_244} My house?{32_1_244}
My house is...{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}The building across from the {Location_43_24_23}
is where I live.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Well, that's about it for now.
When you get the hang of things, you
may want to add more buildings.{35_0}{NextPage_49}{35_1}{35_0}{35_2}Oh, yeah,{32_1_244}
come here for a minute.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}I bought you one female cow.
This is her feedbox.
I'd like you to give her a name.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}{Input_128}? That's a good name.
Our first cow. This is cause for
celebration. Take good care of her, now.{35_0}{NextPage_49}
{35_2}By the way, it's been about 10 days since
this cow gave birth, so you can milk
her a couple of times a day for now.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}I think that's everything.{32_1_244} Almost forgot!
You've got to think of a name for the
farm. Have any good ideas?{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All right.{32_1_244} While we're at it, let me
introduce you to the people who live here.{35_0}{NextPage_49}
{35_2}I'm not really a people person, but
you're still young, so you probably need
some friends. Let's go...{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}This is Tim and his wife Ruby. They run
the {Location_43_35_23}.{32_1_244} And their son Rock.
How should I introduce you?{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}{CharName_0}? I see.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Oh...{52_0_0_0}
{39_2}And there's a girl named
Nami staying on the second floor here.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}This is Galen and his wife
Nina.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}This is Chris.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}This is her husband Wally and
their son Hugh.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Griffin is the {Location_43_33_23}'s bartender,
and Muffy works there part time.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Romana lives in the {Location_43_34_23}
with her granddaughter Lumina.
And that's their butler Sebastian.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Vesta also runs a farm here.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Over there is Vesta's brother
Marlin, {32_1_244}and that's
Celia, who helps them with their work.{35_0}{NextPage_53}
{31}
{35_0}{35_2}They'll sell you seeds for your crops.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}There are people living over there, too.{NextPage_49}
There are two brothers who make fireworks,
an artist, a guy who does experiments,
{35_0}{35_2}a guy who's always playing the guitar...{35_0}{35_1}{NextPage_49}
{35_0}{35_2}Oh, and...{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}There's a professor and his assistant
living in the tent by the waterfall.
They're doing some kind of excavation.{35_0}{NextPage_53}
{31}
{35_0}{35_2}Well,{32_1_244} I guess that's about it.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}You must be tired out by all of
this excitement.
You can take it easy for a while.{35_0}{NextPage_49}
{35_2}If you have any questions,
ask me any time.
Well,{32_1_244} have a good rest.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that guy playing the guitar
over there is named Gustafa. He's always
playing that guitar of his.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}You're your father's daughter,
all right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}It's a shame about your father.{32_3_132}
Fate works in mysterious ways.{32_3_132}
Anyway, I'm sure he's in a better place.{NextPage_49}
{35_2}Come on...{32_1_144} The farm's this way.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Take your time and think about it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think I'll be heading for bed soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time for me to go to bed.
Maybe you should go home?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to be now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to be leaving soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm about to go out...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I'm leaving now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_55}Hey there...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Working hard?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, you don't have anything
to sell.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's no point in having a store
if you've got nothing to sell.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you have something you want to sell,
hold it and talk to people.
But you can't guarantee they'll buy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Try talking to your customers.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got to be assertive to sell things.
Even if you get refused, sometimes people
will buy if you keep asking them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you can't get anyone to buy anything,
it might be best to close the store.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ask me if you have any questions.
But I think you'll learn fastest if you
try a lot of things on your own.{NextPage_49}
If you're having trouble, I wrote down
some advice in the notebook on the shelf.
And this may be none of my business, but{NextPage_49}
you should try to find a husband soon.
If you don't, it's hard on me as well.
I'm sure you understand.{NextPage_49}
By the way, if you try showing lots of
items to people they may tell you some
interesting things. Remember that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're not very talkative, so I
was a little worried.{NextPage_49}
Be sure to ask if you have any questions.
But I think you'll learn fastest if you
try a lot of things on your own.{NextPage_49}
Oh, and remember that I wrote some advice
about running the farm in that notebook on
the bookshelf, so take a look at it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you want to ask me about something?
{41_3_1}About animals.
About crops.
Not right now.
----------x----------
You keep animals like cows and sheep in
barn. When you get a new animal, you
decide where to put its feedbox.{NextPage_49}
When a feedbox is empty, just fill it
with fodder.
Maybe once or twice a day...{NextPage_49}
You can make fodder by cutting grass in
pasture. If you have more questions about
animals, look in my notebook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
To raise crops, you first have to till the
soil with your hoe. Then plant a seed and
water it. Water the soil when it gets dry.{NextPage_49}
Eventually a flower will bloom and after a
while the crop will be ready to harvest.
Fertilizer can help make better crops.{NextPage_49}
Also, remember that crops planted next to
trees won't grow. If you have other
questions, look in my notebook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_56}I see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you want to ask me about something?
{41_3_1}About shipping.
About ordering.
Not right now.
----------x----------
The only things I can sell in the city are
{12}dairy products{17} and {12}crops.{17}. Put the things
you want to sell in the {Location_125_158_159}pping Bin{17}.{NextPage_49}
If you look at the Shipping Bin, you can
move items from your rucksack into it.{NextPage_49}
If you want to sell things to the people
in {Location_112_165_168}get-Me-Not Valley{17}, try opening a
store next to the {Location_115_164_164}er Inn{17}.{NextPage_49}
There's more information in the notebook
on the bookshelf, so take a look.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you want me to buy something for you,
use the order form in the {Location_43_24_23}.{NextPage_49}
If you have questions look at my notebook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The key to raising animals and crops well
is being observant.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wouldn't know, but
raising children must be
difficult...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I look at your kid I remember
when I first met you so long
ago.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you have questions look at my notebook
on the bookshelf.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Having a family...
It's pretty nice, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_55}Working hard?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_55}How're you doing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_55}You're out late, aren't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_56}Oh, that looks quite good.
Is it for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
All right, I'll take it.
{50_7_0_3}Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks quite good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take care.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not too fond of that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_54}Give me a break, okay?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you want me to do with that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't want any part of that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_7_0_3}Pretty cute...
Looks like you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see a resemblance to Mash, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_7_0_3}Kid seems pretty happy.
Looks like you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see a resemblance
to Rock, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_7_0_3}Quite a gentle face on this one.
Kid's sure to be clever.
Reminds me of you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Something makes him look like
Gustafa, too...
----------x----------
{34_1_54}Didn't I tell you that
I don't like dogs?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_55}Take good care of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_7_0_3}{34_1_55}Hey kitty,
Who is a good kitty?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_55}Take good care of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you want to sell that, write its name
on the notebook in the {Location_43_24_23}.
Look at the part that says {12}SELL{17}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take good care of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We can't sell that one yet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear that if you take good care of your
chickens, they may lay golden eggs.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ducks can't keep their eggs warm
by themselves.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_56}{50_7_0_31}Oh, is that a baby duck?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ducks lay eggs like chickens, but you
can't tell them from chicken eggs.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can buy normal seeds from the farm
on the other side of the river.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you plant that seed and give it water,
it will sprout.{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
Oh, you grew that?
I don't know much about growing good
crops but Vesta might be able to help you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you had a “Seed Maker” you could
get seeds from that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can use fertilizer to make
tastier crops, but they don't really
look much different on the outside.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_56}Is that milk from our farm?
Should I give it a taste?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
All right, I'll take it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't mind?
Good milk sells for a lot of money, so
we should know what it tastes like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The taste of milk varies depending on
the kind of cow and how happy they are.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that cheese from our farm?
Should I give it a taste?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
You don't mind?
Good cheese sells for a lot of money, so
we should know what it tastes like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The taste of cheese depends on the
milk you use to make it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that butter from our farm?
Should I give it a taste?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
You don't mind?
Good butter sells for a lot of money, so
we should know what it tastes like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The taste of butter depends on the
milk you use to make it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If that's a {13}Fertilized Egg{17},
you can put it in the {Location_115_164_153}ubator{17}
and a chick will hatch...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Depending on how you treat your chickens,
the quality of their eggs will change.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_7_0_31}Did you catch that fish?
{50_7_0_3}Good job.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't ship fish, so you'll have
to sell it yourself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that wild plant from around here?
They can be tasty when used in cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't ship wild plants so you'll have
to sell it yourself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's quite a tool you've got there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Use it well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty unusual stone... You could
probably sell that for a fair amount...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Van the traveling salesman
would probably buy it from you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_56}What is that?
Where did you dig that up?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_54}That's kind of strange looking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A variety of wild plants grow,
depending on the season.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_7_0_31}{34_1_56}What is that thing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you throw it?
A disk... something... Isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not really interested.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that some kind of spice?
You got that from {CharName_25}, didn't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet you could make something good if
you used that in your cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}{50_7_0_30}......???{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}{50_7_0_30}{34_1_56}...........????{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}{50_7_0_30}{34_1_56}...........????{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that the gold medal that
Wally had?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, it must not be very valuable.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an unusual necklace...
There's probably a story behind that....
{32_1_244}{50_7_0_4}Maybe it's cursed or something...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm... A cursed necklace.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that one of that old man's
fireworks?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_7_0_31}It's not a bomb, is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you try showing that to someone
else. They might say something.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_56}There's no point in showing me that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It was always a dream of mine to work
this farm with your father, you
know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I was a younger man, I went to many
places and got mixed up in many things.
Many things...{NextPage_49}
But thanks to that, I was able to meet
your father.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know how much longer I'll be able
to work here with you, but...
I plan to be buried here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That food you gave me a while ago
was really delicious.
{50_7_0_3}That's one of my favorites.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That food you gave me a while ago
was really terrible.
{50_7_0_4}I don't need any more of that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
tasted really nutritious.
Yep, that was mother's milk, all right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
tasted a little off.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
was OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
was pretty tasty, but it
could still be better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
was the best that normal cows can give.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
wasn't great tasting, but I think it
would make good cheese.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
tasted OK. I think if you processed
it, it would taste better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
was pretty tasty, but it would be even
better as cheese.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
tasted fantastic. You have to try
making it into cheese.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
certainly tasted expensive, but it's
still a little bland tasting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
tasted good, but it could be better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
was rich and delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk must be the best milk there is.
{50_7_0_3}Well done.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
didn't taste bad, but maybe it would be
best as butter.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
tasted OK. I think if you processed
it might taste better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
tasted pretty good. But I bet it would
be even better as butter.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
tasted fantastic.
But maybe it's a little too strong.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave me a while ago
was really delicious.
{50_7_0_3}Good job.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave me the other day
smelled a little odd. Was it goat cheese?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave me the other day
was made with Mother's Milk, wasn't it?
It was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave me was OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter you gave me a while ago
was rich and delicious.
{50_7_0_3}You're doing well...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter you gave me a while ago
smelled a little odd. Was it goat butter?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter you gave me a while ago
was made with mother's milk, wasn't it?
It was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter you gave me was OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've gotten a lot better at your
work recently, haven't you?
You're a real farmer now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're quite good at raising crops, yes?
Maybe you should focus on that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're quite a cook, you
know.
You should make something for me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're really working hard on the farm.
You seem more mature.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Raising crops is hard work, but you're
doing a good job. I can tell your
hands are those of a farmer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you often cook at home?
I hear that you're quite the gourmet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess you're getting used to the farm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're getting used to growing crops, eh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're getting used to cooking, eh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let me tell you something.
This is one of my favorite recipes:{NextPage_49}
Try making a soup with Turnips, Carrots,
and Fish.
I bet it'll be good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let me tell you something.
This is one of my favorite recipes:
No, a different one this time.{NextPage_49}
Try making a dessert with a Sweet Potato.
I bet it'll be good.
Well, basically it's a baked yam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let me tell you something.
This is one of my favorite recipes.
A brand new one:{NextPage_49}
Try making a main dish with Cheese, Butter
and Milk.
I bet it'll be good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you cook, you have to think about
the recipe.{NextPage_49}
If you don't have a good recipe, the best
ingredients will go to waste.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I cook by myself pretty often,
you know.
I've been living alone for a long time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The more you cook, the more types of food
you'll be able to cook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_7_0_26}We should go out for a drink
sometime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_7_0_9}{34_1_54}Hic...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Not a bad house, is it?
I like it pretty well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think this life is the best for me.
I'm not very good with people.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is life on the farm hard?
Just don't worry too much about it.
Take it one day at a time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you're tired from work, it can be good
to take a little rest.
But don't waste too much time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cows won't give you milk all the time.
If they're sick or about to give birth,
they won't give milk.{NextPage_49}
And around 40 days after they've given
birth, they'll stop giving milk, too.
Take that into account when you plan.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is the perfect season for
using Miracle Potions.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cows don't give as much milk at
this time of year.
It must be the heat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cows don't like hot weather much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can make a lot of money selling milk,
but you can make even more by turning
it into butter or cheese.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Butter and cheese made with good milk
sell for a high price in the city.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't just run around all the time.
Take some time to smell the flowers.
Take it easy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
For a while after a cow gives birth,
she produces mother's milk.
Give it to the calf to help it grow.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cows give the most milk at this time
of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got quite a number of chickens now.
If you want to make a yard for them, order
the materials. I'll figure something out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got quite a number of chickens now.
If you want to make a yard for them, order
the materials. I'll figure something out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've been thinking about cutting down the
trees on the back lot and making another
field. If you want, order the materials.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The soil in the woods back there is quite
fertile. It'll make a good field.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you spread fertilizer on grass once,
it'll keep growing afterward.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can use your brush by the water
trough in the pasture to wash your
cows, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you cut the grass with your sickle,
it'll turn into fodder that you can put
in your animals' feedboxes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you want to move your animals in or out
of the barn, just use the buttons on the
wall.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can only keep up to 8 birds in here.
Any more than that and they would get
upset in the crowded space.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whenever a chicken sees a round white
thing on the ground, they sit on it and
keep it warm. It must be instinct.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you have a rooster with your chickens
some of your eggs will be fertilized. You
can put them in the incubator to hatch.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How are you doing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If there's something you want, just
write it in the notebook on that
desk over there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Remember: crops and dairy products
go in different shipping bins.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If I have anything to tell you about sales
or orders, I'll write you a note.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whenever I'm here I feel
calmer.
Like my heart is at peace.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I came here for the first time,
I saw a giant lizard. It had a hurt leg,
so I helped it out...{NextPage_49}
You sometimes still see it wandering
around here, I'm told.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They say that Harvest Sprites live in
these woods... You believe that?
I do. Are you surprised?{NextPage_0}

Oh, I see...
No, not right now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If your animals are outside, you should
put them in the barn when it rains.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral Town
won the cow festival ten times...
Amazing...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If there's something you'd rather do with
your life, there's no point staying here.{NextPage_49}
You've got your own life to live. I hope
you find something that you want to do.
Good luck...{NextPage_49}
I wish the best for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {Location_43_49_23} will be finished soon.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
Are you looking forward to it?{32_3_232}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey!{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
The {Location_43_49_23} is finished!{32_3_232}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The new field will be finished soon.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
Are you looking forward to it?{32_3_232}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey!{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
The new field is finished!{32_3_232}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's an old custom in these parts.
If you give a {13}Blue Feather{17} to
someone, it means you want to marry them.{NextPage_49}
If they accept the feather and you get
married, you'll live happily ever after.{NextPage_49}
I sometimes see them being sold for very
high prices in the city, but here? No.
You're very lucky to find one.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Aren't {CharName_20} and {CharName_1}
home yet?{NextPage_49}
It's getting so late...
Where could they have gone?
{41_2_0}I'll go look for them.
They're OK. They're together.
----------x----------
Well, that's true...
But aren't you worried?
Shouldn't you go look for them?
{41_2_0}I'll go look for them.
They'll be home sooner or later.
----------x----------
Alright, I'll look around too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm... If you say so...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, they're back...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a relief...
I guess I'll be going home too, then...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
To the left is the cheese maker and
to the right is the butter maker.{NextPage_49}
If you put milk in the cheese maker,
you can make cheese.{NextPage_49}
Put milk in the butter maker to
make butter.{NextPage_49}
Simple, huh?
Well, that's about it.
Use it well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you put your chickens in here,
they'll be able to feed themselves.{NextPage_49}
And don't worry -- they can't get away.{NextPage_49}
Well, that's about it.
Use it well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This field has more nutrients in its
soil than the others. You should
be able to grow some good things here.{NextPage_49}
Well, that's about it.
Use it well.{NextPage_0}
