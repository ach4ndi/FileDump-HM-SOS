\u1f46\u2013\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Now who are you?\u232b\u1f46\u2013\u1fac\u1f49\u2136\u232a?\u2328That's a real nice name.\u232b\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136I'm \u206eGeorgia\u206c.\u2328It's a pleasure to meet you.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Goodness, that was some\u2328terrible weather yesterday!\u2328Hope your farm is okay.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Well, how are you today?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136How's it going?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136How's it going?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136What a sweet thing!\u2328I just love animals!
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136I don't think it fancies\u2328me much.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Well I...a blue feather!?\u2328For little old me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fac\u1f4d\u2136W-Well now, maybe we should\u2328go some where to talk this\u2328over properly...
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136So that's a blue feather?\u232bI reckon it's got nothing\u2328to do with me, but whoever\u2328you give that to is lucky...
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Who's the present for?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136Oh, another gift today?\u2328I simply couldn't...
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Why, what delicious-looking\u2328chocolate! For Harmony Day?\u232b\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136So that's today...\u2328Well then, thank you kindly.\u2328
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Why, is today Harmony Day?\u2328\u232b\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136I see. And these are for me?\u2328But I'm not your wife...\u232b\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Well, if you say so, then\u2328thank you. I'll accept them.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Not for me, thank you.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Goodness! What delicious\u2328\u206dfried rice\u206c!\u2328A birthday present for me?\u232bWhy, thank you!\u2328I just love this!
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Oh, why, I just love\u2328\u206dfried rice\u206c!\u232b\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Thank you!\u2328How thoughtful.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136How's it going?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136How's it going?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Thank you.\u2328I am so pleased you\u2328remembered my birthday.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136I just love this.\u2328And you got it for me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Thank you kindly!
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Oh, that's a present?\u2328I suppose it is my birthday.\u2328Sweet of you to remember!\u232b\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Thank you kindly!\u2328You're pretty nice...
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Why, is that for me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Thank you kindly.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Oh, that's...a present?\u2328I suppose it is my birthday.\u2328But...\u232b\u1f46\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136I don't much care for this.\u2328Be more thoughtful next\u2328time.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136Is that for me, now?\u232b\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136I wish I could refuse it,\u2328but I suppose I can't...
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f4a\u2136I hate roasted eggplant.\u2328Didn't you know that?\u2328\u232b\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136I'll take it since you've\u2328gone to the trouble, but\u2328be more careful next time.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136How's it going?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136How's it going?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136How's married life?\u2328It seems like it would be\u2328a lot of fun...
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136You'd best stay in the house\u2328during a typhoon like this.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136This's some snow we're\u2328having. It's hard to get\u2328any work done.\u232b\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Maybe I'll go make\u2328a snowman... 
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136You know me so well,\u2328\u232a.\u2328\u232bI hope you stay here in\u2328the village forever.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Want to hear something neat?\u232bIf you're close to your dog,\u2328it'll help herd your\u2328animals.\u232b Big dogs will help with\u2328cows, and small dogs will\u2328help with alpaca.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Want to hear something neat?\u232bIf you get close to your\u2328cat, it will help herd your\u2328chickens. It's true.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Want to hear something neat?\u232bYour owl can carry you\u2328from the mountaintop to\u2328either of the villages.\u232bIt's so handy.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Brushing is important if you\u2328want to get along with your\u2328animals.\u232bOf course, you also need to\u2328feed them and let them out\u2328to play.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136All our animals are fit as\u2328a fiddle.\u232bAnd they're all so sweet. I\u2328hate to see them go, but\u2328you're welcome to buy one.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136You can rent horses here.\u2328Just make sure you take\u2328good care of them.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136How's it going?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f4a\u2136Don't you have something\u2328to say to me?
\u2332 I'm sorry.\u2328 Not really.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Well, since you apologize...\u232b\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Okay, I forgive you.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Is that so?\u2328Goodbye, then.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136How's it going?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136My, what terrible weather\u2328we had yesterday. I'm so\u2328glad everyone was alright.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136How's it going?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136How's it going?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136How's it going?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136How's it going?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Why, I didn't expect to get\u2328this now that we're married.\u232b\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136You're such a romantic.\u2328Thank you!
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136My, does this fried rice\u2328look tasty!\u2328It's a birthday present?\u232bI'm so glad you remembered.\u2328Thank you! I'm so lucky.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Goodness...\u2328Is that for me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136You remembered what I like.\u2328Thank you...\u2328
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u2391.\u2328Why don't we go for a walk\u2328together once in a while?
\u2332 Okay, let's go now.\u2328 Not today.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136If you don't feel like it,\u2328we can go another day...
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136How's it going?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136I hate roasted eggplant.\u2328Didn't you know that?\u232bAnd on my birthday...\u2328This is awful...\u2328But I guess I'll take it.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Why, is this for me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136But I hate roasted eggplant.\u2328You should really remember\u2328what foods your wife likes.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136I can't believe we're going\u2328to have a baby...\u2328
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136I'm going to be a mother\u2328soon...\u2328I hope I'll be a good one...
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136You're going to be a father\u2328soon. I know you're going\u2328to be a great one.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136I'm so happy to be with\u2328you every single day...\u2328
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136You always work so hard, but\u2328remember to take care of\u2328yourself, now.\u232bDon't forget to take\u2328a break when you need one.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136You should go to bed. You've\u2328got to get up early.\u232bDon't worry about me. I'll\u2328come to bed shortly...
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Shetland ponies are the\u2328hardest working horses.\u2328Then come thoroughbreds.\u232bPonies are cute, but they\u2328aren't good workers.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136I'd love an owl for a pet.\u2328\u232bIt would be amazing to be\u2328carried from the\u2328mountaintop.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Now that we're married, it's\u2328important for us to share\u2328all the household tasks.\u232bWork always goes quicker\u2328with two people...\u2328
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136\u2391, are you\u2328satisfied with our marriage?\u232b\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136I know I am. Sometimes I'm\u2328not sure about you, though.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136It's so boring sitting\u2328around the house all day.\u232bIs this how marriage is\u2328supposed to be?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136You've really changed since\u2328we got married...\u232b\u1f46\u1fac\u1f4b\u2136We never talk anymore...\u2328I'm so lonely.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f4a\u2136You know why I'm mad, right?\u2328
\u2332 I'm sorry. Don't be mad.\u2328 No, why?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Well, I suppose since you've\u2328apologized...\u2328I forgive you.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136You jerk! I know you\u2328know why...
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Are you going to use that at\u2328the \u1000?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136How's it going?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136How's it going?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136What a sweet face...
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136You ought to let this one\u2328go.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136What a sweet face...
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136What a sweet face...
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Why, you're looking mighty\u2328sharp today! Nice outfit!
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Are you free today?\u2328Maybe we could talk\u2328for a spell?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Are you free?\u2328Want to go for a little\u2328walk with me?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Are you free today?\u2328Maybe we could talk\u2328for a spell...
\u2332 Sure, I've got time.\u2328 I'm busy right now.
\u2332 Sure, I've got time.\u2328 I'm busy now.
\u2332 Yeah, okay.\u2328 Not right now.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136How's it going?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136How's it going?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f4d\u2136Oh, never mind if you're\u2328busy, then...\u2328Maybe some other time.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136Oh, okay...\u2328Maybe when you're free...
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Just let me know when\u2328you feel like hanging out.\u2328
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136What a pretty flower.\u2328Oh, a present for Flower\u2328Day? Thank you.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136What a pretty flower.\u2328Thank you, \u2391.\u2328You're the sweetest.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Say now, \u232a.\u2328About the Starry Night\u2328Festival tomorrow...\u232bWant to go with me?
\u2332 Yeah, sure.\u2328 No thanks.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Really?\u2328Thank you! I'm so happy!\u232bWell, I'll see you at 8 PM\u2328at Town Hall. I can't wait.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Oh, I see.\u2328Never mind, then...
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136I can't wait for tomorrow's\u2328Starry Night Festival.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136My, how pretty...\u2328I wonder what's inside?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136You're such a sweet girl.\u2328I'm always happy to talk\u2328with you.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136How's it going?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136I thought we might be able\u2328to talk for a spell...
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136I always play with the\u2328animals on my day off.\u232bDo you give your animals\u2328plenty of attention?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Didn't I do well? I'm real\u2328good at catching fish. I bet\u2328I'll win next year, too.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136We're a little busy, but\u2328make yourself at home.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f49\u2136I thought I'd take a walk\u2328since it's my day off.\u232bBut I couldn't stop\u2328wondering how the horses\u2328were doing.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136I thought I'd take a walk\u2328since it's my day off, but\u2328the weather's not so great.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136I come here every day to\u2328see to the horses.\u232bAren't they sweet?\u2328I could look at them\u2328forever...
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Oh, where are you off to?\u2328
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136How's it going?

\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136How's it going?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136How's it going?
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136You should enter the\u2328Cooking Festival for this\u2328village next time.
\u1f46\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Didn't I do well? I'm real\u2328good at catching fish. I bet\u2328I'll win next year, too.
