Where did the murder
weapon go?"{NextPage_1}Everyone says they
were at dinner,
but people came and{NextPage_1}went all night.
They went to the
bathroom, they went{NextPage_1}to take medicine,
answer the phone,
etc...{NextPage_1}Each time they had a
brief moment, they
could have made their{NextPage_1}move!
Slide: "Everyone here
seems innocent.{NextPage_1}Looks like I have no
