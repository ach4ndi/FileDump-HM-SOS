\u1f40\u1fac\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eAntoinette\u206c\u232c\u2328What?\u2328Do you want something?
\u1f40\u1fac\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eAntoinette\u206c\u232c\u2328You've noticed that I'm\u2328always by myself?\u232bHmm.\u2328Well, I don't really know\u2328anyone in this town.\u232bSo it's usually just easier\u2328to be by myself.
\u1f40\u1fac\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eAntoinette\u206c\u232c\u2328I used to live in a\u2328city far from here.\u232bBut a little while before\u2328you came, I moved here\u2328with my father.
\u1f40\u1fac\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eAntoinette\u206c\u232c\u2328My mother stayed in the\u2328city for her job.\u232bShe designs clothes\u2328and accessories.
\u1f40\u1fac\u1f49\u2135\u232f\u206eAntoinette\u206c\u232c\u2328\u21b0Hm.\u232bIt's odd that I'm telling\u2328you these things, even\u2328though I barely know you.
\u1f41\u1fa4\u1f48\u2332 Your mom must like her job.\u2328 What's the city like?
\u1f40\u1fac\u1f4c\u2135\u232f\u206eAntoinette\u206c\u232c\u2328I suppose.\u2328\u21b7She likes it too much.\u232b\u1f40\u1fac\u1f48\u2135I wish she'd make more\u2328room for other things.\u232b\u1f40\u1fac\u1f49\u2135But you seem like someone\u2328who knows how to balance\u2328work with everything else.
\u1f40\u1fac\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eAntoinette\u206c\u232c\u2328Thanks for talking to me,\u2328\u232a.
\u1f40\u1fac\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eAntoinette\u206c\u232c\u2328Many people go there\u2328to chase their dreams.\u232bBut they just end up working\u2328some mindless job to pay\u2328the bills.\u232bThere's a lot of opportunity\u2328there, but also a lot of\u2328broken hearts and dreams.
