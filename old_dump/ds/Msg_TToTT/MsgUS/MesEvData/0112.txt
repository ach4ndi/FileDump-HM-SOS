\u1f46\u2013\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Well now, I haven't see you\u2328around before, dear.\u2328You're \u232a?\u232b\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136I'm \u206eJessica\u206c.\u2328I raise livestock.\u2328It's lovely to meet you.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f4b\u2136Wasn't the weather yesterday\u2328just something else?\u232bIt spooked the animals so\u2328badly, it took me a while \u2328to calm them back down.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Oh,\u232a.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Oh,\u232a.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Oh,\u232a.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136Well, how cute!\u2328And so affectionate!\u2328Aren't you precious?
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f4b\u2136Sorry. I hate to say this\u2328about an animal, but I\u2328just don't like it.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Oh,\u232a.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136Oh my, what a surprise!\u2328If it isn't a Blue Feather!\u232bThat sure takes me back...\u2328My husband brought me\u2328one when he proposed...
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Oh no, don't you worry\u2328about me.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Oh, I couldn't take another\u2328gift today. Why don't you\u2328give it to someone else?
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Oh,\u232a.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Oh,\u232a.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136That doesn't look like\u2328something you should be\u2328giving away.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136Oh my, is that \u2328a \u206dcheese dumpling\u206c?\u2328I love those!\u232bOh, it's a birthday\u2328present for me?\u2328Thank you, dear!
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136This is my favorite!\u2328Thank you so much, dear!\u2328How wonderful!
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Oh,\u232a.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Oh,\u232a.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136I didn't expect to get a\u2328birthday present from anyone\u2328but Ash and Cheryl today.\u232bThank you, \u232a!
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136You're giving this\u2328lovely gift to me?\u2328Thank you, dear.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136How in the world did you\u2328know it was my birthday?\u232bThank you, dear. You've made\u2328me very happy.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Thanks, dear.\u2328You shouldn't have.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f4b\u2136For my birthday?\u2328Well, I suppose it's the\u2328thought that counts.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f4a\u2136Oh, for me? This...is a\u2328pretty thoughtless gift.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f4b\u2136I just hate this.\u2328You're not trying to be\u2328mean to me, are you?
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Oh,\u232a.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136How are you and Ash\u2328getting along, then?\u232bCheryl always wants to tag\u2328along with him. I hope she's\u2328not getting in the way.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136Married life is treating\u2328you well. You're looking\u2328better than ever.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f4b\u2136This is some typhoon...\u2328The animals are all so\u2328nervous. The poor things...
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f4b\u2136It's tough to get work done\u2328in weather like this.\u232bAre things alright at\u2328your place, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136If you have any problems\u2328with your farm, just come\u2328and talk to me.\u232bI'm happy to help.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136Looking at you reminds me of\u2328myself when I was a young\u2328rancher.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136With farm work, there's\u2328never a dull moment,\u2328.wouldn't you say?
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Are you getting enough\u2328to eat? You know, I\u2328worry about you sometimes.\u232bYou need to eat to keep\u2328your strength up.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136How are things at your\u2328farm, \u232a?\u232b\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f49\u2136I do try to keep up on my\u2328competition.\u2328Hahahaha.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136My animals are all\u2328sweet as pie.\u232bThey give good milk,\u2328and lovely wool, too.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Isn't this a nice village\u2328to live in? We're all like\u2328one big family.
\u1f46\u1fb2\u1f48\u2136Oh,\u232a.
