\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136Is your work on the farm\u2328going smoothly?\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136Today, my young friend,\u2328I'm going to teach you\u2328about \u206dirrigation trenches\u206c.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136Do you know about trenches?
\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136Here we are!\u2328An irrigation trench!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136When you grow crops in a\u2328trench, you can water and\u2328fertilize them all at once.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136Handy, right?\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48Trenches are very easy to\u2328make.\u232bWhile you're tilling with\u2328the hoe, keep the \u206d+Control\u2328Pad\u206c pressed in a direction!\u232bThen press the \u206dA Button\u206c\u2328over each new square you\u2328step on.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136Each new square you till\u2328will be added to the trench.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f4b\u2136But you do have to watch out\u2328for one thing...\u232bTrenches must be in one\u2328unbroken line...\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136In other words, you can't\u2328branch trenches or connect\u2328them up to each other.\u232bIf you make a mistake\u2328digging a trench, there's\u2328only one way to fix it...\u232b...And that's by hammering\u2328the ground flat and trying\u2328again.
\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136So to make a trench like\u2328this, you'd till in a line\u2328from one \u206darrow\u206c to the other.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136But...\u270aif you leave a\u2328tilled square untended for\u2328a week...\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f4b\u2136...The trench will disappear\u2328at that spot!\u232bIf that breaks a long trench\u2328in the middle, too bad!\u2328It can't be fixed.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136That's why you need to be\u2328careful.
\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136That's what you need to know\u2328about irrigation trenches.\u232bWould you like me to explain\u2328it one more time?
\u2332 Please explain it again!\u2328 No thanks, I got it!
\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136Very well!\u2328I'll explain one more time.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136An irrigation trench is a\u2328continuous line of tilled\u2328squares.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136Let me show you a trench and\u2328explain it to you.
\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136In that case, please go\u2328ahead and grow some crops!
\u2332 No, please teach me.\u2328 Yes, I already know.
\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136Very well, I'll explain!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136An irrigation trench is a\u2328continuous line of tilled\u2328squares.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136It's easiest to just show\u2328you an example.
\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136Oh, you do?\u2328I'm glad to hear it!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136In that case, please go\u2328ahead and grow some crops!
