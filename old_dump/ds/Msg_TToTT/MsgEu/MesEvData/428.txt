\u1f40\u2013\u1faa\u1f48\u2135\u2014Are you up, \u232a?\u2328I'm coming in.
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136I'm going to be away\u2328traveling this summer.
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f4c\u2136I can't stand anyplace with\u2328hot weather.\u232bThe heat and the buzzing of\u2328insects bother me... I\u2328can't concentrate.\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136So I must find a place with\u2328cool green shade and flowing\u2328water... My kind of place.
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136I'll return in the fall.\u2328Until then, farewell.
