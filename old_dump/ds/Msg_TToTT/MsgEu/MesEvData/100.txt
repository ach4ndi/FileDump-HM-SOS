\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136That weather was vicious\u2328yesterday. Is your farm\u2328okay?
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136It's so cute!\u2328I love animals!
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2136That your pet?\u232bI love most animals, but\u2328I'm not a big fan of this\u2328one.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Huh? A Blue Feather!?\u2328Really? For me!?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4d\u2136G-Gotcha.\u2328Well, let's go somewhere\u2328and talk about this.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Oh, a Blue Feather?\u2328Who're gonna give it to?\u232bYour lips are sealed, right?\u2328Whoever you give it to,\u2328they sure are lucky.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136For me?\u2328I don't really want it.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Is that for me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2136I'll pass. I can't take\u2328another gift today.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Huh? A Harmony Day present?\u2328You really mean it?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Wow, thank you so much!!\u2328You're sweet.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Huh? A Harmony Day present?\u2328You really mean it?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2136I really shouldn't, though.\u2328Won't your husband get\u2328jealous?
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Nah, I don't need that.\u2328Looks important, though.\u2328Where'd you get it?
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Oh, wow! \u206dGratin\u206c!\u2328That's my favorite!\u2328And for my birthday, too!\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Wow! Thank you so much!\u2328I love it!!
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Oh, wow! \u206dGratin\u206c!\u2328That's my favorite!\u2328\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Great! Thanks!\u2328No take-backs, now!
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Huh? For my birthday?\u2328\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Thanks!\u2328It's way too nice...
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Huh? A present?\u2328\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136It's great! I love it!\u2328Thanks!
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Huh? A birthday present?\u2328You remembered! Thanks!
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136You're giving this to me?\u2328Thanks!
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Huh, a birthday present?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2136Oh, uh...\u2328Thanks...
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136You're giving that to me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2136Well, if you insist.\u2328Thanks, I guess...
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2136So, uh, that's...\u2328for me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136I guess I can't refuse it.\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2136Uh...thanks...\u2328I guess.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136How's married life?\u232bIt can be tough, but\u2328keep working at it.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136What are you doing out\u2328in weather like this?\u232bThe wind's so strong,\u2328you better watch out\u2328for flying animals...
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136With this much snow,\u2328you gotta be careful that\u2328you don't slip out there!
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136How's work on the farm?\u2328Things going well?\u232bRaising animals is hard\u2328work, but they'll repay your\u2328efforts with their love.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Do you like farm work?\u232bWould you like to stay here\u2328in this village forever?\u232bI'll bet if we worked\u2328together, we could have\u2328an amazing farm.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136My mom says you've been\u2328working really hard lately.\u2328\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136I agree.\u2328Watching you makes me want\u2328to work hard too!
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a,\u2328what do you think of Cam?\u232bHe's hard to approach at\u2328first, but he's really nice.\u2328You'll see if you hang out.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136My little sister Cheryl\u2328is kind of a tomboy, but\u2328she's a really sweet girl.\u232bShe's kind of selfish\u2328sometimes, but I hope\u2328you can see her good heart.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Are you used to farming now?\u232bAnimals can be a lot of\u2328work, but they're worth it.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136If you ever need anything\u2328for your farm, just stop by\u2328my family's shop.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136I'm really mad at you right\u2328now. I'm sure you know why.
\u2332 I'm really sorry.\u2328 Whatever.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136It's okay. I understand.\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2136Honestly, I was probably\u2328getting mad over nothing.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4b\u2136..........
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Yesterday's weather was bad.\u2328I'm just glad nothing \u2328happened to the farm.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Huh? A present?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Oh yeah, it's Harmony Day.\u2328How cool to still get a\u2328gift. Thanks.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Whoa, is this...for me?\u2328For my birthday?\u232bThanks! It's just what I\u2328wanted! You're the best!
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Wow! For me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136You know just what I like!\u2328Thank you so much!
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136We can still go on dates\u2328even though we're married.\u2328So how about a date, then?
\u2332 Okay, let's go!!\u2328 Let's go another time.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2136I see...\u2328We'll go another time, then.\u2328I can't wait!
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2136Uh, so that's...\u2328that's for me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4b\u2136What a terrible birthday\u2328present. But I guess I have\u2328to take it...
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2136Uh, so that's...\u2328that's for me?\u232bWhy would you give me\u2328that? Well, I'll take\u2328it if you insist.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136So we're going\u2328to have a baby...\u232bIt still doesn't feel real.\u2328But what a miracle...
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136You have to take care of\u2328yourself and the baby.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, have you thought of\u2328any names for the baby?\u232bI have some ideas myself,\u2328but I think you should\u2328name our first.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Waking up to your face makes\u2328my day perfect.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136There's a lot to do, but\u2328I'll always make time for\u2328you, \u2391.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Marriage is so great.\u2328I know you're always there\u2328for me.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136You're so amazing, \u2391.\u2328You always give everything\u2328a hundred percent!
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136We're both so busy these\u2328days...\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136But I'm always thinking\u2328of you.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136How's work going?\u232bIt's good to be busy,\u2328but just don't work\u2328too hard.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136\u2391,\u2328do you like our life?\u232bI know I do, so I\u2328hope you do too.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2136I feel like we haven't\u2328been connecting lately.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4b\u2136I think that you've changed\u2328since we got married.\u232bMaybe it's my imagination,\u2328but it seems like\u2328you're colder to me now.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u2391, do\u2328you have something to say?\u2328
\u2332 I'm sorry.\u2328 Not really.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136No, I'm not mad.\u2328I was just a litter worried.\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136But since you apologized,\u2328everything's okay. 
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Really? Are you sure?
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Oh, didn't you need that\u2328for the festival?
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Is that your pet? Make sure\u232byou take good care of it.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Heh heh. It's so cute.\u2328I really like it.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2136Don't bring that in here.\u2328You should let it go. 
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136You can't keep wild animals\u2328in the house.\u2328Better let it go.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136I don't know much\u2328about fashion, but\u2328I think that outfit's cool.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a,\u2328why don't the two of us\u2328go out somewhere?
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, I've been wanting to\u2328talk to you.\u2328Is today okay for you? 
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Uh, I was wondering if you\u2328want to go for a walk.
\u2332 Okay, let's go!\u2328 I'm busy today.
\u2332 Yeah, okay.\u2328 Not right now.
\u2332 Sounds good!\u2328 No thanks...
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2136Oh.\u2328Maybe some other time?
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Well, some other time,\u2328then.\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4b\u2136So...when do you think\u2328next time will be?
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Okay, got it.\u2328No, nothing.\u2328Never mind. 
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Huh? That flower is for me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Oh, today's Flower Day!\u2328Thanks! This is great!
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136A present for Flower Day?\u232bWhat a pretty flower!\u2328Thanks.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Will you come with me to\u2328the Starry Night Festival\u2328tomorrow?
\u2332 Sure, I'd love to.\u2328 Sorry.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Wow! You really will!?\u2328Great!\u232bThanks. I'll be waiting\u2328for you at 8 pm\u2328by Town Hall.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Oh, I see.\u2328No, it's okay.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136I can't wait for the \u2328Starry Night Festival.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Ooh, it's so pretty.\u2328Presents really need to\u2328be wrapped, I think.\u232bIt's so much fun\u2328to unwrap them.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.\u2328Do you like spending\u2328time with me?\u232bI have a lot of fun hanging\u2328out with you.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Let's take it easy.\u2328I'm a little tired today.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136I don't have work tomorrow,\u2328so I think I may\u2328go see Cam.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136I saw Cam today.\u2328He's really working hard\u2328at the flower shop.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136It's a little busy here,\u2328but just take it easy.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136I'm off to work.\u2328I'll be home early.\u2328Have a good day.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Hi, \u2391.\u2328Are you all done with work?\u232bLet's go home together.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136I go to see Cam on my days\u2328off.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Using the tunnel makes going\u2328between villages so easy.\u2328It's a real life saver.\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136It means you can spend more\u2328time in the other village.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136If you don't use an\u2328umbrella, you'll catch\u2328a cold. 
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2136I'm feeling kind of \u2328down today.\u2328No, never mind.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136I hope you compete for our\u2328village next time!
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136I'd love to try your\u2328cooking next time...

\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Hey, good morning.\u2328Let's work hard today!
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Hey, good morning.\u2328You're looking well!
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Good morning, \u232a.\u2328How are you today?
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Hello. How's your\u2328farm doing?
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Hey, \u232a.\u2328How's work going?
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hello, \u232a. Hey, you sure\u2328you have time to chat? Don't\u2328you have lots of work to do?
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Evening.\u2328Good work today.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Evening, \u232a.\u2328Wow, it's already so late.\u2328Time sure flies.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Hey, good evening.\u2328All done with work?
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136We'll be married soon.\u2328Are you all ready?\u232bI'm so excited! I can't\u2328wait!
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Weddings seem like so \u2328much work. My mom is so busy\u2328with preparations.\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2136I feel like I can never do\u2328enough to help.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4d\u2136I can't wait to see you\u2328in your wedding dress,\u2328\u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136If you need animals,\u2328just ask my mom, Jessica.\u232bCheryl is in charge of\u2328feed and equipment, so\u2328you can order them from her.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136My mom and sister take care\u2328of the orders, so talk to\u2328them if you need anything.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136All our animals are\u2328healthy and strong.\u232bYou know why?\u2328Because I treat them\u2328with love.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136It's nice to take a break\u2328and relax with my friends\u2328sometimes.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136The cake here is so good.\u2328Laney is such an amazing\u2328baker.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Have a seat and relax for\u2328a little while.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Farm work is tough,\u2328but it's a job worth doing.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Cheryl's still a kid,\u2328but she's very responsible\u2328for her age.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Animals need\u2328love and tenderness.\u232b\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2136Hmm? That sounded like\u2328something Cam would say.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Good morning.\u2328Let's work hard\u2328and stay positive!
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u2391!\u2328How are you this morning?
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, good morning.\u232bHow did you sleep?
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Hey, \u2391.\u2328It's past noon.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Are you taking the day off?
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Oh, \u2391.\u232bDid you oversleep?
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u2391.\u2328Look at the time!\u2328
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136It's already night time.\u2328I can't believe this is\u2328our first conversation.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Oh, \u2391.\u2328Did you finish work?\u2328I just finished too.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136\u1001 won the Cooking\u2328Festival today thanks to\u2328you, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136I heard your cooking\u2328was the best today.\u232bMy mom said that we\u2328won thanks to you.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Where did you learn to cook,\u2328\u232a?\u232bIt took some serious skills\u2328to win that contest!
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136The \u1000\u2328was so much fun today!
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136How was the\u2328\u1000\u2328for you?\u232bDid you have fun?\u2328I always look forward to it.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136I had so much fun today.\u2328But it's kind of sad\u2328when it's all over.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Congratulations\u2328on your win today.\u232bYour \u1004\u2328was awesome.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Everyone makes really good\u2328food here in the village.\u232bSo if your food's the best\u2328here, it might be the best\u2328in the world.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136You won today because of\u2328all the hard work\u2328you've been putting in.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136I had so much fun today.\u2328Did you have\u2328fun, \u232a?
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136It's so much fun getting\u2328together with everyone\u2328like this.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136I always feel kind of sad\u2328after a festival is over.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136You won\u2328today, \u232a.\u2328Congratulations!
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Everyone tried hard,\u2328but none of them\u2328came close to you.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136You need to show me how\u2328to fish sometime.\u232bAll I ever seem to catch is\u2328boots.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Congratulations!\u2328Now you're a real farmer!
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136I was so impressed today.\u2328The \u1002\u2328you raised was amazing.
\u1f46\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136You must really\u2328love animals.\u232bYou could never raise such\u2328a great \u1002\u2328if you didn't.
