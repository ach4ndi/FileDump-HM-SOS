\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I just love spring!\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136The smell of growing things\u2328is so calming!
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Spring's finally here!\u2328All the flowers in my\u2328flower bed are blooming.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136The cherry blossoms will be\u2328in full bloom soon.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136They make the village look\u2328so beautiful.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I'm trying to think up some\u2328spring desserts.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136I always have so much fun\u2328thinking up recipes.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136It's so humid out.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4b\u2136A cold drink is so nice to\u2328have on a day like today.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136It's been so hot lately.\u232bBe careful not to get\u2328dehydrated.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136It's been so hot!\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136It might be a good time to\u2328visit the mountain where\u2328it's cooler...
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4b\u2136It's so humid today!\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136I love eating cold things\u2328when it's hot out.\u232bBut you have to be careful\u2328not to get brain freeze!
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Fall's really here...\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136The leaves are always really\u2328beautiful in the mountains.\u232bI need to go leaf watching\u2328before it gets too cold.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Fall's really here...\u232bI'm thinking up some new\u2328recipes using seasonal\u2328ingredients...\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Heh heh.\u2328Want to be my taste tester?
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136It gets so cold in the\u2328mornings and evenings now.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136And it's just going to get\u2328colder.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Fall's really here...\u232bThere's something so lonely\u2328about the autumn sky and\u2328wind...\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136But it's still one of my\u2328favorite seasons.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136It's a lot colder today.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Try not to catch a cold!\u2328
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136I feel like I'll freeze\u2328when I'm outside now.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4b\u2136I hate winter because it's\u2328so rough on my skin.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136It's so cold now!\u2328I can't wait for spring.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136When spring comes, I'm going\u2328to plant some flowers.\u2328I can't wait. 
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136As long as you keep moving,\u2328you'll stay warm.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136It's just hard to keep\u2328moving in this weather.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136The laundry dries so quickly\u2328on sunny days.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4a\u2136You have to get it all done\u2328while the sun is out!\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Laundry is a battle between\u2328you and time!
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I always want to take a\u2328long walk on sunny days.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136The other day I went for a\u2328walk in the mountains.\u2328It was so nice!
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136The weather changes a lot in\u2328the afternoons lately.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136I guess it's just the\u2328season...
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136When it's nice out, I tend\u2328the flowers in my flower\u2328bed.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136The better care you take of\u2328them, the more beautifully\u2328they bloom.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4b\u2136I hate rain. It always\u2328makes me feel down.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136I wish it would clear up...\u2328
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I miss the sun on rainy\u2328days.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136Everything's so dark and\u2328gloomy. It's hard to get\u2328moving.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136I saw someone slip on the\u2328Town Hall steps the other\u2328day when it rained.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136You should be careful...\u2328
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136Whenever I buy a new\u2328umbrella, it always stops\u2328raining...\u232bI kind of want to use my\u2328new umbrella...\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136But I guess I'd rather not\u2328have rain!
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I used to get into some\u2328big snowball fights when\u2328I was a kid.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136It was really fun because\u2328everyone got so into it...
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136I saw someone slip on the\u2328church steps the other\u2328day when it snowed.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136You should be careful...\u2328
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Everything is so quiet\u2328on a snowy day.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136It's so strange, almost like\u2328we're in another world.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I always used to make\u2328snowmen when it snowed.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136I love the way snow sparkles\u2328in the sun. It made every\u2328snowman shine!
\u1f40\u1fab\u1f4b\u2135...\u232bI don't really like it here.\u2328
\u1f40\u1fab\u1f4b\u2135......\u232bThere are bats near the\u2328tunnel...\u232bI...I don't like bats.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136I had a lot of fun today.\u2328\u232bLet's talk again soon!
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Thanks for everything today.\u2328Let's chat again!
\u1f40\u1fab\u1f4b\u2135I'm sorry.\u2328I'm going to head home.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136It's nice having time to\u2328chat together like this.\u2328\u232bThanks for everything today.\u2328I had a lot of fun.

\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4b\u2136\u20d0Ahh!\u232b......\u2328...!?...\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136I-I'm sorry!\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4b\u2136There's something rustling\u2328over there...
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a,\u2328what do you think of my dad?\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136You probably think he's\u2328weird, don't you?
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I love growing flowers.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136It makes me so happy when\u2328the flowers I've taken such\u2328good care of finally bloom.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I think the best festival is\u2328the Starry Night Festival.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136It's such a beautiful\u2328celebration.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I take a lot of pride in\u2328the tea I make.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Next time you have to have\u2328some and let me know what\u2328you think of it.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136I really hate bugs.\u2328If I ran into a big\u2328swarm of bugs...\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4b\u2136Oh, I couldn't handle it.\u2328I think I would just die...
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Despite how he may look,\u2328my dad is a huge busybody.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4a\u2136The other day, he was\u2328pestering to me to hurry up\u2328and find a husband...\u232bSheesh...\u2328He's so nosy!
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I love growing flowers.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136It makes me so happy when\u2328the flowers I've taken such\u2328good care of finally bloom.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I think the best festival is\u2328the Starry Night Festival.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136It's such a beautiful\u2328celebration.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136When you make tea, you\u2328should use a round teapot!\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136It makes the tea taste\u2328much better!
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4b\u2136When I was little, I lost\u2328my pet beetle...\u232bLosing that pet was such a\u2328shock for me...\u2328
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136My dad can really do\u2328anything, you know...\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136He always took such good\u2328care of me when I was\u2328growing up.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136I love this village!\u2328I want to make sure that\u2328it's filled with flowers!
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I think the best festival is\u2328the Starry Night Festival.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136I'd love to be able to\u2328spend it with someone that\u2328I love...
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136More people drink black tea\u2328than any other tea.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Its taste has a really\u2328broad appeal.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136When I was little, I lost\u2328my pet beetle...\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4b\u2136Not only was that a shock...\u232b...but that night I had a\u2328nightmare about being\u2328chased by hundreds of bugs.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4a\u2136I think that was the start\u2328of my bad relationship\u2328with bugs...
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136When I was a kid, I forgot\u2328my lunch on a field trip.\u232bMy dad climbed up the\u2328mountain to bring it to me.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136It was kind of embarrassing\u2328since all my friends were\u2328there, but it was sweet.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136I love this village!\u2328I want to make sure that\u2328it's filled with flowers!
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I think the best festival is\u2328the Starry Night Festival.\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136I'd love to be able to\u2328spend it with someone who\u2328I love...
