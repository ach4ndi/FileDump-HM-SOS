All right, let me explain how to do it.
Press the {Location_107_2_108}utton{17} to clean the grave.
But you can't just do it any old way.{NextPage_49}
You have to do it gently and put your
whole heart into it.{NextPage_49}
But you can't take all day, either.
Try your best to finish cleaning it
in 60 seconds.{NextPage_49}
All right, here we go.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Great job!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's enough!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't think you did a very good job,
but I do appreciate your sentiment.
Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You only did a mediocre job, but I'm
sure Nina will appreciate it anyway.
Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, you did a pretty good job.
I'm sure Nina is very happy.
Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh!
You've made Nina very happy!
And me too!{NextPage_49}
I don't know how to thank you, but
Thank you very much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello there.
Thank you for keeping my grave clean.
I'm happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There aren't many like you these days.
Please try harder next time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There aren't many like you these days.
Please try a bit harder next time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There aren't many like you these days.
I'm quite satisfied.
Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let me explain how to play the game.
Just press the {Location_107_2_108}utton{17}.{NextPage_49}
The more times you press the {Location_107_2_108}utton{17},
the more milk you can drink.
Simple, huh?♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK, here we go.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ready... Set...{32_7_208}
----------x----------
Go!{32_3_232}
----------x----------
That's enough!{32_7_208}
----------x----------
Let's see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} is the winner.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Congratulations!
You did well!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey there young un'. Want to play my game?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
I see. That's too bad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really? Great!
You've made an old man happy!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Should I explain the game's rules?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
All right, let's start the game.
I'll go first.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK, here are the rules.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK, I'll explain the rules again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We each take turns placing lines on the
board to capture territory.{39_48}
----------x----------
You can move the cursor with the Control
Stick or the ＋ Control Pad.{NextPage_49}
If you press the {12}B Button{17} while
moving the cursor, you can
move it faster.{NextPage_49}
Press the {Location_107_2_108}utton{17} to place a line.{39_48}
----------x----------
When you surround an area with your
lines, it becomes your territory.{32_3_232}{39_48}
----------x----------
Oh, I almost forgot. You can only put
lines in places where there aren't any
lines already.{39_48}
----------x----------
The smallest possible territory is one
triangle, but try to capture many at once.{39_48}{31}
If your opponent has lines inside your
territory, they will change to your color.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But if your opponent has some territory
within the area you captured, it remains
his color.{39_48}
----------x----------
You can build off of the lines surrounding
your territory to capture new spaces.{39_48}
----------x----------
When there aren't any more spaces to
place lines, the game is over.{NextPage_49}
The person with the most triangles in
their territory will be the
winner.{39_48}
----------x----------
Oh, I forgot. Both players have a time
limit, so you can't spend too much time
thinking about your moves.{NextPage_49}
But you'll always have at least
a few seconds to make a move.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are the game rules.
Do you want me to explain them again?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry, but your time is up.
I win this time.{NextPage_49}
It's good to be careful about your moves,
but if you take too long, this can happen.
Next game, pay more attention to the time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Too bad.
I win this time.
Hmm. Maybe I tried a little too hard?{NextPage_49}
No, just kidding.
I hope you'll come and play me
again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm. That was a close one.
I win this time.
I'll be waiting for a rematch.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?!
I lose!
Ho ho ho.{NextPage_49}
Well done.
I'd be happy to play you again,
Young un'.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Darn!
I lose!
You're pretty good, young un'.{NextPage_49}
But things will be different next time.
I'll want a rematch against you
sometime, so please play me again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ho ho ho.
This time it's a tie.{NextPage_49}
You're pretty good, youngin'.
Let's play again sometime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All right, here we go.{NextPage_1}You can go first.{NextPage_0}
