\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Say now, \u232a.\u232bThere's something I've been\u2328wanting to ask you...
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136Um, you see now, well...
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136D'you think I'm strange?
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4b\u2136You know...because of the\u2328way I talk?
\u2332 Yeah, it's really weird.\u2328 I think it's cute.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4b\u2136So you do...\u2328
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136You see, my dad and I\u2328haven't always lived here.\u232bWe lived on a ranch way out\u2328west most of the time I was\u2328growing up.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136I picked up my accent out\u2328there.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4b\u2136I know it sounds a mite\u2328strange here...\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136But I hope you'll just think\u2328of it as unique.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136That's all I wanted to\u2328say today. I'll be going\u2328now. Bye.

\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4d\u2136Cute...? Really?
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136You see, my dad and I\u2328haven't always lived here.\u232bWe lived on a ranch way out\u2328west most of the time I was\u2328growing up.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136I picked up my accent out\u2328there.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4b\u2136I know it sounds a mite\u2328strange here...\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136You've never said anything\u2328about how I speak...\u2328\u232bBut I did wonder what\u2328you thought.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4d\u2136I never dreamed you'd say\u2328it was cute, though.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136You sure know how to charm\u2328a lady.
