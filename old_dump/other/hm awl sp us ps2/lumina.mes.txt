Excuse me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pardon me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you don't have anything?
Never mind then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you don't have anything to sell,
I'll have to come back later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I'm just looking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess there's nothing I want here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like the {29_0},
but how much is it..?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}My, that's a sweet deal.
Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh. Never mind then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello, {CharName_0}.
How are you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}I'm bored today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}Bored. Bored. How boring.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Good morning!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Oh, hello, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, hello {CharName_0}.
What are you doing out at this hour?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, hello {CharName_0}.
What are you doing out at this hour?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Thank you for coming.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Oh, I love that kind of thing.
Could I have it?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}{34_1_60}Yippee! Thank you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}Oh. How boring.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Ooh, that's nice.
Can I have it?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}I love that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}Eww, that looks gross.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}I hate that kind of thing.
Are you trying to tease me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}Yuck! What is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where did you get something like that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}How cute.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Yes, you're a cutie!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}What a cute doggie.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My auntie likes cats, but I
love dogs myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute little doggie.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You shouldn't carry cats
around like that, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cats are so mysterious.
The cats at our house are pretty
cute and lovable, don't you think?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}I don't like chickens.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't like chickens, but I
don't mind baby chicks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}I told you I don't like them!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, you have ducks, too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do ducks lay eggs, too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Some kind of seed?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you grow that on your farm?
Growing things must be fun.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are lots of kinds of crops, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't like milk very much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sebastian always tells me that milk
is good for me and makes me drink it.
But afterward my stomach gets upset.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that cheese on your farm?
It looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Oh, is it for me?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
That cheese looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cheese is good for you, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that butter on your farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet Sebastian would like to
have that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Butter. Butter. Butter?
It's kind of a strange word
if you utter it enough.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, an egg.
Is it for me?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
If you kept that egg warm, do
you think it would hatch?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is there something special about that egg?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you always walk around
carrying things like that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Raw fish is all slimy and
yucky. But the slime is good for the fish.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a wild plant from around here.
I guess Sebastian sometimes uses those
in his cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you like those, {CharName_0}?
I don't like them very much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a wild plant from around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that, {CharName_0}?
{50_9_0_10}Wow, it looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you like to cook,
huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a weird hoe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know anything about tools.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a well-used hoe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a hoe, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a strange sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You shouldn't wave that thing around.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a sickle, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Something special about that sickle?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Say, isn't that the watering can
that we used to have around the house?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did my auntie give that to you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a strange watering can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That's a watering can, right?
When I was younger, I used to water
the trees in the garden with one of those.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}{34_1_60}If you fill that up with water and spin
around, it can be pretty fun. Hee hee!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you like watering cans or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an odd machine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what that's used for?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
............{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those flowers grow all around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a pretty flower.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that, anyway?
A seasoning?
What does it taste like?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If it's a seasoning, I bet Sebastian
would know something about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what kind of seasoning it is?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}That's an unusual sound.
But I like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is the medal for? A race?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an unusual necklace
It's very pretty though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, sheet music.
But it doesn't seem to be piano music.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I wonder what kind of song it is?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really only understand piano music,
so I don't know about that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Could that be a... firecracker?
Cool.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did Kassey make that?
Or maybe Patrick?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet that'd be pretty if you set it off.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That sure is a big firecracker.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}What is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Auntie Romana is actually my
grandmother. But she likes me to
call her ♪Auntie♪ here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I often practice my piano when
I'm at home.
You can hear it from outside, I think.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My mother and father both
died in an accident when I was
still very young.{NextPage_49}
I'm sorry for bringing this up so
suddenly.{NextPage_49}
But I wanted to tell you
about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the person running the
farm in Mineral Town is
really rich.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the person running the
farm in Mineral Town is
really popular.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that someone grew every crop
there is. In Mineral Town, I think.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you ever been to Mineral Town?
The person who runs the farm there
is really kind to his animals, I hear.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the person running the
farm in Mineral Town really likes
digging holes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that somebody in Mineral Town
has caught every kind of fish there is.
I wonder if he caught the fish here, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Walking one million steps is amazing.{NextPage_1}But does it really accomplish
anything?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farm in Mineral Town
has been going for 61 years.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard there's a master fisherman
in Mineral Town.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the person running the
farm in Mineral Town has
really bad taste.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard somebody in Mineral Town has
three cottages.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know, I heard that they have
something called ♪Mythic Tools♪
in Mineral Town.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That thing you gave me
was really delicious.
I'd love some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me
tasted all right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}The {29_0} you gave me
was pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}The {29_0} you gave me
was the best!{NextPage_1}Really!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me tasted
really nutritious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me tasted
kind of weak.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That milk you gave me
was good. But it still upsets my tummy.
Do you think I'm lactose intolerant?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That milk you gave me was really
good. But it still upsets my tummy.
Do you think I'm lactose intolerant?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me tasted
good, but it seems a tad bit
weak. My stomach didn't mind it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That milk that you gave me was the
best I've ever tasted.
But my tummy still doesn't like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me tasted
good, but...
It seemed a little too strong.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That milk you gave me
tasted just great.
But maybe it's a little strong for me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That cheese you gave me
was really good.
I'd love some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave me was
really strong tasting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That cheese you made
was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That butter you gave me
was really good on bread.
I'd love some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter you gave me was
reaaally strong tasting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That cheese you made
was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}The {29_0} you made
was reaaally good.
Please make it again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}I thought that food you gave me
was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That wild plant you gave
me was one of my favorites.
It was really good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}I thought the wild plant you
gave me was good, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I ate that thing that you
gave me, but I can't remember
what it tasted like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that you work
hard on your farm.{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_10}Everybody says that you're
a real farmer now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}I heard that you're
good at growing things.
Auntie seemed very impressed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everybody says that the food you
cook is the best.{NextPage_49}
But I wonder if you're a better cook
than Sebastian.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that you're working
really hard on your farm.
Everybody is impressed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that you're pretty good
at growing things.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everybody thinks that your
cooking is great.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, everybody says
that you're finally used
to farm life.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that you're doing your
best to raise your crops.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that you're doing a
lot of cooking. It must be difficult.
to farm and cook at the same time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did Auntie tell you about this?{NextPage_49}
She took me in when I was young.
{50_9_0_9}My parents died, and...{NextPage_49}
And so I came to live with my
Auntie Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Apparently Kate is writing a book
about my Auntie Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Auntie Romana's had a very interesting
life, so I think she'd make a great
subject for a book.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder how Kate is going to
portray Auntie Romana?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That Kate is a gifted writer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Auntie Romana is a very good person.
She can sometimes be a little strict, but
she's also cheerful and fun.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just love living here.
Auntie Romana and Sebastian are so nice.
But I do get lonely sometimes.{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_9}After all, I don't really have any
friends, and my mom and dad are. Well,
there's no point in worrying about that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't tell Auntie Romana that
I'm lonely, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what my kind of person
my father was?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's kind of nice to come to a place
like this once in a while.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My Auntie says I shouldn't come here.
But that's not right, is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}I like it here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Forget-Me-Not Valley is a nice place
to live. The people are so interesting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Auntie Romana gets angry
if I call her ♪grandma.♪{34_1_60}
But don't tell anybody.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's nothing very interesting in
my room, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}At this time of year, I feel like
going outside.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Is farm work fun?
It looks kind of interesting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Sometimes when I'm just passing
time here, I come across the most
interesting animals.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes a big lizard appears near the
forest, but it's got a bandage on one of
its front legs. Who could have done that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I see beautiful scenery I feel
like painting a picture of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes a big turtle appears near
the swamp, but it's got a red scarf
tied to it. Who could have done that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}The air feels nice and crisp, doesn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what would happen if the
snow accumulated?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

Maybe I should increase the tempo a bit...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This damper pedal isn't working well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if this should be ritardando?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Oh, hello.
Did you come to listen to me
play the piano?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I'm sorry.
I don't feel like playing right now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Oh, that's good. Because...
{50_9_0_9}I don't feel like playing right now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If I try to play when I don't feel like
it, I can't play very well anyway.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Please come and hear me play later.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I like playing the piano, but my
practice pieces aren't very interesting.
I don't like them.{NextPage_49}
But if I don't practice, I'll never
get good enough to play the
songs that I really like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Oh, hello.
Welcome!{u_805a}
{41_2_0}Aren't you going to play piano?
Hello.
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Not right now.
I'm trying to work out a
particular motif at the moment.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Make yourself at home.
{50_9_0_10}Right now I'm thinking of how to
arrange one of the songs I always play.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}It's fun to play music just as it is
on the page, but recently I've discovered
how much fun it can be to improvise.{u_805a}{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_26}But I'm kind of embarrassed, so I only
do it when there's no one around to hear.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}For the number of people living in
{Location_128_15_128}{32_128_53}get-Me-Not Valley{17}, there certainly
are a lot of people who play instruments.{NextPage_1}Playing an instrument is a lot of fun.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Why don't you take up a musical
instrument?
It'll help you relax.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Oh, hello.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Isn't our garden always so pretty?
{50_9_0_10}That's because Sebastian takes such
good care of it.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Don't you think that it's
very relaxing here?
{41_2_0}Maybe so...
I sure do.
----------x----------
{50_9_0_0}You can't relax here?
{50_9_0_9}That's too bad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Tee hee.{u_805a}
It makes me very happy to hear
you say that.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Van's store is open today, isn't it?{NextPage_1}Have you already finished your
shopping for today?
{41_3_0}Yes.
Not yet.
I don't need to shop today.
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}That's good.{u_805a}
Even when I don't have anything to buy,
I always get excited when Van arrives.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Oh... Then you can't spend
very long talking with me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Really?
I don't suppose you've already bought
everything Van has for sale?{NextPage_1}That would nice...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Auntie Romana always looks
forward to the days when Van
opens his store.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}I like to just relax here in the garden
when I have some time off.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}You should really take a rest
on your days off.{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_0}Oh...
{50_9_0_26}I guess you don't really get days
off on a farm, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I don't think Auntie Romana looks forward
to Van coming just because she
likes to go shopping...{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_2}I think she likes teasing
Van even more than shopping.
{50_9_0_9}Do you think Auntie Romana is mean?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}Auntie Romana keeps telling
Van all of these diets that she's
made up. Isn't that terrible?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}It seems like each day is the
 same in {Location_128_15_128}{32_128_53}get-Me-Not Valley{17}{NextPage_49}
But by deciding that one day is going
to be my day off, I feel like I can really
relax. Maybe I'm in a rut?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, hello.
What are you doing out so late?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whenever I have a problem I always
get an urge to play the piano.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_7}...................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing out so late?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I'm sorry.
I need to be alone to think right now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Oh, hello.
Did you have some business here, too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Patrick and I are friends.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}I'm friends with Kassey, too,
but Patrick and I have more to talk about.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}I wonder when they're going to set off
some fireworks. I want to see it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}ÄPatrick has one more hair on his
head than Kassey.Ö{NextPage_49}
ÄPatrick seems pretty proud of it, but
{50_9_0_2}don't mention it to Kassey.Ö{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Kassey says that he likes blonde women
like Muffy.{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_2}Patrick said I look too young
to interest Kassey.
Can you believe that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Oh, hello.
What a nice coincidence...{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Kate is like my little sister.
I've always wanted a sister, so that
makes me really happy.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}It's fun to talk with Kate.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Samantha is always very
nice to me, too.{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_9}I'm so jealous of Kate, having
such a kind mother like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Kate is a very smart girl, you know.
Sometimes I think she's more of an
adult than I am.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}ÄI think Kate has a crush on
Hugh.❤Ö{NextPage_49}
ÄBut she could never admit that
to him. Whenever they're together,
she bullies him instead..Ö{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Grant seems to like music,
so I think we would get along well, but
he doesn't talk to me much...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Have you read one of Kate's
novels?
{50_9_0_10}She's a great writer!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Kate may not look it, but
she's actually a very sensitive girl.
I think that comes out in her writing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Kate inspires me to want
to play the piano better!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Aren't you going to open
your store?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}But there's something I want to buy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}There aren't any real stores here, so
it's always exciting when Van arrives.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_26}I bet if you opened a store of your
own, everybody would be happy to come
and buy from you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Hello.❤
Welcome.{u_805a} I've been waiting for you.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you done with your work?
{41_2_0}All finished!
Not yet...
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}I should have known.❤
We can take our time and talk then.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Well! You wanted to come and see me
so much that you're skipping your work?
How wonderful!❤ Thank you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Sebastian keeps telling me how
beautiful I've become recently.{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_0}But when I look at myself in the
mirror, I don't see anything different.
{50_9_0_10}Isn't that strange?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}{Location_128_15_128}{32_128_53}get-Me-Not Valley{17} has always been
a pretty place with nice clean air, but
these days it seems even more beautiful.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Recently I've been reading a book
of poems I got from Van.{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_9}Even though they aren't sad poems or
anything, I find myself crying.{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_10}These are short poems, but
I've never read anything that moved me
that much. {50_9_0_26}I'm really surprised.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Oh, hello.
You came to visit me?{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}You came just at the right time.
I didn't have anyone to talk to.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}I'm going to ask you a question
now, OK?
{50_9_0_3}I found it in a fortune-telling book.{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_10}Say the first thing that comes to mind.
Who do you associate with the color white?
{41_3_0}My mother.
Lumina.
Nobody in particular.
----------x----------
{50_9_0_12}Oh, really?
{50_9_0_2}.Well, I guess that
could be.{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_10}According to the fortune-telling book,
the person you choose is the person that
you want to marry.{NextPage_49}
Does that mean that you want to marry
someone like your mother?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_26}M-me?!{NextPage_49}
Oh dear.
According to the fortune-telling book,
The person you associate with white is...{NextPage_49}
The person that you want to marry.
At least that's what it said.{NextPage_49}
Me? Your wife?
{50_9_0_10}Maybe we shouldn't trust that book...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}Hey, that's no kind of answer!{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_0}Oh, I see.{NextPage_49}
I guess that means that you don't
want to marry anyone at the moment.
{50_9_0_10}You see, according to that book,{NextPage_49}
the person you associate with white is
the person that you want to marry.
At least that's what is said.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}There are lots of interesting questions
like that in the book, but I don't have
anybody to ask them to.{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_2}I'm tired of asking them to Sebastian
and Auntie Romana won't answer them
seriously.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}It's so much fun to talk
to you that I forget about the time.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Come and visit me whenever you're free.{u_805a}
I'll be waiting!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you.
But I had better not right now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You are busy every day, any weather.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The sound of raindrops is
comforting, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just don't enjoy playing the piano
recently. Auntie Romana is so...{NextPage_49}
I just don't know what it means to
♪play more freely.♪
{41_2_0}Just work harder.
Just have more fun.
----------x----------
I don't know how to work
any harder than I already am!
That's impossible!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}So we can play it, and sing songs...{32_1_144}
That's why.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Of course!{32_1_144}
You know, I feel like I've just
remembered something very important.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Could I talk to you for a minute?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I started playing piano when I was three.
Auntie Romana taught me.{NextPage_49}
Whenever I played without making any
mistakes, she would praise me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But it turned into a kind of pressure for
me. The more was expected of me...{NextPage_49}
And every time I was told how good a
player my mother was... I felt worse.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
After a while I got so scared
of making mistakes...{NextPage_49}
I was so afraid that I would
disappoint Auntie Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I was trying to live up to
my mother's memory.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But Auntie Romana never wanted
that to happen.{NextPage_49}
That's why she tells me that I
should play more freely.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel so much better now.
I think I'll be able to enjoy playing
the piano now.{NextPage_49}
Thank you, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Auntie Romana! I was listening to that!
You know very well that I painted that!
What was that about Ronet's apprentice?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You said ♪she liked Ronet.♪ But I still
like her. I'm still alive, you know!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Poor Van.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, did you see that?
Isn't that terrible?{NextPage_49}
.........................{NextPage_49}
Do you think I might actually
have talent as a painter?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, I thought of you
like an older brother...{NextPage_49}
I shouldn't cry so much, I know.{32_5_220}
I'm going to continue playing my piano.
I hope you'll be watching over me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, could you please
sing a song for our friend
{CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to be going to bed soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time for me to go to bed.
Could you come back tomorrow?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to be leaving soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time for me to go out.
If you'll excuse me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Goodbye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Umm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I need to ask you something.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {32_1_44}{CharName_0},
have you been there all this time?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
........................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, {32_1_244}do you like art?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll paint your portrait sometime.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Heehee. {32_1_244}Well, I must be going.
Please make yourself at home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder where Sebastian could
have gone looking for another
paintbrush...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh! {32_1_244}Sebastian.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you mind?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All right then, {CharName_0}.
See you later!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello, Rock.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_7}A toupee! I can't believe it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got to be kidding me!{NextPage_49}
Not bald!
Not you, Rock!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{13}..............?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_7}{CharName_0}...{NextPage_49}
Sebastian doesn't wear a toupee, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This has nothing to do with you, Rock!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}No!!{NextPage_49}
{32_1_44}{50_9_0_0}I was thinking about my parents.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't remember my parents at all.
I wonder what kind of people they were.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_0}But even if I ask Auntie Romana,{NextPage_1}she never gives me a straight answer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_0}Maybe Auntie Romana told
Sebastian not to say anything?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_7}He won't tell me anything...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_7}If I could do that, there'd be no problem!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Rock...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_26}Now?
I was about to go to the forest.{NextPage_49}
Would you like to come with me, Rock?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But I wanted to go to the forest today...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}Rock, you're not listening to me at all!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}{50_9_0_4}So why did we come to the sea today?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
....................{32_1_244}I don't hear anything.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmph!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Rock, you're just like a little kid.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But...{NextPage_1}You and I are both kind of selfish.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_25}No one's ever said that to me before.{32_1_244}
Thank you, Rock.{50_9_0_3}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sebastian...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's nothing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, it's you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}You came to visit me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}I was just looking at an art book
that Auntie Romana gave me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Would you like to talk a bit?
{41_2_0}With pleasure.
I'm busy. Maybe some other time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Tee hee.
Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That art book I was looking at was of the
paintings of a friend of Auntie Romana.{NextPage_1}I've always liked their paintings,
ever since I was a little girl.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}I feel a sort of warmth
in their paintings, you know?
{41_2_0}What kind of paintings are they?
Are they paintings of fires?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}There are always two
or more people in them.{NextPage_1}{50_9_0_4}A mother feeding her baby,
an old man giving a ring to an
old woman...{NextPage_1}{50_9_0_10}There was even one of two small
boys fighting over a piece of cloth!{NextPage_1}I feel like I can understand the feelings
of the artist, and even the feelings of
the people in the paintings.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}In my favorite one,{NextPage_1}a girl about my age and girl who
looks a little older are having fun
playing the piano together.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was so jealous of that girl...
{41_2_0}You want an older sister?
You want someone to play with?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}But you know?{NextPage_49}
Ever since you've started coming
here to visit me,{NextPage_49}
I feel like I have a big brother.
It's been so nice!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_25}If you'd play the piano with me,
it'd be even better, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't get everything I want.
After all, you've got your own
work to do.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't get in the way of your
work, now can I?{NextPage_1}Thank you for listening to me.
I'll see you out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Tee hee.
You're pretty funny.
No...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}What? How boring!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}But it can't be helped.
You've got your work
to do, after all.{NextPage_1}I'll see you out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Good luck with your work!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Maybe I'll go play with Liz
and Tanya.{NextPage_49}
Goodbye.
Please come again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Come again!
Big brother.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Auntie Romana. Don't laugh.
Am I that funny?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wonderful? Why?
When I'm in this much pain...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_215}Wait!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um... Would you like to go to the ocean?
{41_2_0}Sure.
Sorry, I'm busy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?
Then let's go.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've really become a part
of Forget-Me-Not Valley.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I never used to go to the beach.
I was afraid of getting sunburned.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's pretty isn't it? The ocean?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you remember who the first
person you fell in love with was?
{41_3_0}I haven't fallen in love yet.
I forget.
What about you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Oh... I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Then I guess you wouldn't understand...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Auntie Romana said that
I was in love...
But I...{NextPage_1}I'm not sure I know what that means.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_26}I know that I feel very happy looking
out at the ocean with you.
Like I'd like to do it forever...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sebastian is looking for me...
I wonder what he wants?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I'm sorry.
I have to go. It's too bad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...............{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_26}I... I...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_26}I don't really understand it, but...{NextPage_1}You see...
Auntie Romana said that
I was in love...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like everyone in Forget-Me-Not
Valley.{NextPage_1}They're all very interesting people.
Of course, you are too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But you're...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Recently when I'm alone in my room and
I think about you...{NextPage_1}I feel a kind of tightness in my
chest...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I don't really understand it, but...
{50_9_0_26}But you're the only one that
makes me feel that way...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If I really had a big brother, would he
make me feel that way?
{41_2_0}Sure he would.
I don't think so.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}If you say so, then it
must be true.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_26}Then that must mean that I...
That you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_26}Oh, Sebastian is looking
for me.
I've got to go....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_26}Um...
You're probably wonder what this little
kid is babbling on about, right?{NextPage_1}Don't worry about it.
But, uh... Please come and visit
me at the Villa again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Oh, yes...
I'm sorry...
{50_9_0_7}.................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your work...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}A-Auntie Romana...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Auntie Romana... I...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...........Auntie........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_26}I'm so... happy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Yes. Auntie Romana. Sebastian.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to study my hardest
so I can be a good wife for
you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you finish your work?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_26}....................
{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll do my best to be a good wife.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hm?
What's wrong all of a sudden?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}What are you saying? You can't do
that to Auntie Romana and Sebastian!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}That's enough!
Sebastian isn't your servant,
{CharName_1}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_0}{2d}, that child....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Hm?
Just a rebellious phase, you say?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_7}Maybe so.
I should have known.{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_0}I'll be more careful in the future.
Thank you, {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hm? Yes?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes?
Really?
So that's why recently...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you've been so distant recently.
I've had a similar experience, so I
can't say I didn't notice.{NextPage_49}
But I thought I couldn't ask you about it,
so I waited for you to say something.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes.
At first I didn't even know I was in love.{NextPage_49}
Auntie Romana had to tell me
before I realized it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well...
It was...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello.
Can I come in?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The truth is...
I have something that
I want to talk to you about.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's been a year since you
came here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And I...
I just had this feeling that you
might be leaving here soon...{NextPage_49}
I don't know why, but I just had that
feeling, so I decided to come here.
So I'm finally going to say this...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You see...
I've fallen in love with you.{NextPage_49}
I know that you only see me as a
little sister.{NextPage_49}
But I thought I had to tell you how I
felt. So... I...{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Propose to her.
I'm terribly sorry.
----------x----------
To think that you felt the same
way about me, and even thought
about marriage.{NextPage_49}
It's like a dream come true.
I...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.....................
I'll be waiting for you to come for me.
I'll be waiting at the Villa.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, I see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry.
I'll be going home now.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
I'm sorry to come so suddenly
like this. But there's something that
I want to say to you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've done a lot of thinking recently.
About what would happen if you left here,
or if you got m-married to someone else...{NextPage_49}
At first I didn't know if I liked you like
a big brother, or as er, a...
a man...{NextPage_49}
But I finally understand my own
feelings now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I'm sorry.
You probably don't understand what I'm
talking about...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
........................
{50_9_0_9}I...
{32_3_232}love you.
I just had to tell you how I felt...{NextPage_49}
But to tell you the truth, I'm not
sure what I want to do about it.{NextPage_49}
All I know is that I'd love to be able
to stay with you...
{41_2_0}Propose to her.
I'm sorry.
----------x----------
Then we'll be able to stay together
forever, right?
Oh, I'm so excited I can't think straight.{NextPage_49}
Is this really happening?
To think that we both felt the same
way... That you could really....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
..........................
I-I'm going to go tell
Auntie Romana.{NextPage_49}
..........................
I'll be waiting at the Villa.
Goodbye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...
.................
Yes, of course.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have bothered you
with this. Goodbye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}{34_1_60}Heehee. {CharName_1},
isn't it nice to have Daddy play with you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...{NextPage_1}I thought it'd be nice if {CharName_1}
would take over the {24_2}Farm.
What do you think?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Definitely.
That's up to {CharName_1}.
----------x----------
That's right!{u_805a} {CharName_1}
was born on a farm!
I'm sure our child will be a great farmer!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe you're right.
It may be a little early to decide that.
I just want {CharName_1} to be healthy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, time for beddy-bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
The food in the refrigerator is
low. Could you put some more in?{NextPage_49}
Good night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yawn...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good morning, {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good morning, {2d}. {u_805a}
You're up early.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, time to get up!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
It's pretty late, so I'm going to bed.
Good night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, it's past your
bedtime!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now, now. If you don't go to bed soon,
you won't grow up big like your Daddy!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's right.{u_805a}
Say ♪good night♪ to Daddy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1},
time for beddy-bye!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Hmm?
Where did that child go?
It's time for bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_0}{2d}!
I'm going to go look for {CharName_1}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Where could {CharName_1} be?
It's time for bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I'm going to go look around a bit!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Oh, thank goodness!
You had me so worried, {CharName_1}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}What a handful this child can be!
I'm going to put {CharName_1} to bed!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's right. Time for bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Time for bed now. It's getting late.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's about {CharName_1}'s bedtime.
Do you think that child is asleep?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} just went to sleep.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
By the way, {CharName_1}
watches a lot of TV lately.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, do you think {CharName_1}
could be interested in farm work?{NextPage_49}
That child seemed so interested in
the farm report!
What do you think, {2d}?
{41_2_0}I bet you're right!
It's too early to tell.
----------x----------
Yes.
I bet {CharName_1} will be helping
you with your work before we know it.{NextPage_49}
Won't that be nice?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_26}I guess so.
But if you set a good example,
{CharName_1}'ll be sure to like farming.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{u_805a}A necklace of{u_805a}{32_7_208}
{u_805a}white flowers...{u_805a}{32_7_208}
{u_805a}Lalalaaaa{u_805a} Lalalalaaa{u_805a} Lalala...{32_7_208}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_0}{u_805a}A necklace I got{u_805a}
{u_805a}from you...{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_0}Be good, {CharName_1}.
Wait just a little longer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_0}{CharName_1}! Awen't you a good wittle
singer! You should sing that for Daddy!{u_805b}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}!{NextPage_49}
{CharName_1} is such a
good singer!{NextPage_49}
That child learned that song in no time!
I bet our child's got a talent for music!
{41_2_0}I'm sure you're right!
Isn't it a little early to tell?
----------x----------
I knew it! A musical genius!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Maybe so...{32_3_232}
{50_9_0_26}I guess I'm being a little silly...{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_3}But if our child has this much
talent, I think we have to be supportive!
{CharName_1}'ll get even better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}What are you dwawing there?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Daddy???{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_25}That's vewy good...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} drew this picture.
What do you think it is?
{41_3_0}Flowers.
Me, of course.
Don't know.
----------x----------
Yes. Flowers...
I think it's pretty good.
{50_9_0_3}I think our child has talent.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}... You really think so?
If you say so, {2d}...{NextPage_49}
!?
{50_9_0_3}Do you think {CharName_1}
might be some kind of artistic genius?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes...
It looks like flowers to me, but...
{CharName_1} says it's ♪Daddy.♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But you know, depending on how you think
about it, {CharName_1} might have
great artistic talent.{NextPage_49}
We probably just can't appreciate it...
{50_9_0_3}Maybe our child is a genius.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}What are you doing there?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}You're working vewy hard...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
Don't you think that {CharName_1} is
quite a little athlete?
{41_2_0}I don't know...
Of course.
----------x----------
I'm sure of it.
{CharName_1} loves jumping around.
Why, our child is a future sports star!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} is your child, after all.
{50_9_0_3}We have to nurture this talent!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
{CharName_1} loves books.{NextPage_49}
Our child's so serious about reading.
In fact, just the other day...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}{CharName_1},
are you reading a book?{NextPage_49}
What kind of book is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come on, what kind of book is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Well, I have to go make dinner.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why {CharName_1}.
Reading again?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}You're so vewy smart, awen't you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} loves to study, I can tell.
Maybe our child's going to be a scholar!
{41_2_0}I think so too.
You're the kid's mother.
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Yep.
A famous scholar.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Hahaha. Maybe I am a little biased.
But we have to help {CharName_1} develop
good study habits in any case.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, there's something I
want to ask you. I don't mean to stick my
nose in your business, but...{NextPage_49}
Have things been going well on the farm?
{CharName_7} is worried because
you haven't been shipping much.
{41_2_0}I'm sorry. I'll try harder.
Who cares about this dumb old farm!
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Do you really mean that?
{41_2_0}No, I'll try harder.
Sure I do!
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}You're joking, right?
{41_2_0}I'm joking.
I'm serious!
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}You're serious?!
Don't you care what happens to the farm?!
{41_2_0}Of course I do. I'll try harder.
Not really...
----------x----------
I'm glad that you said that.
I feel a little better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You scared me there.
But I guess I'm OK now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If we don't make this farm work,
Auntie Romana will worry about us.
Please try harder!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_30}But...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_30}B-but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_30}........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_7}I understand.
Do as you like, I guess.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard a pretty singing voice just now...
Was that {CharName_20}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Could it have been {CharName_1}?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...{NextPage_49}
I wonder if {CharName_1} could have a
talent for music...
{CharName_20} said so.{NextPage_49}
I think our child really likes music, too.
What do you think, {2d}?
{41_2_0}I think so too.
I don't think so.
----------x----------
I thought you'd say that.
I hope {CharName_1}'s dreams come
true.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure our child has the makings
of a great musician.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?
Maybe I'm just being biased.{NextPage_49}
But our child does have a great singing
voice. I think we have to be
supportive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} could be a great musician!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if {CharName_1}
has any artistic sense?
Could our child be an artist?{NextPage_49}
What do you think, {2d}?
{41_2_0}Sure.
It's too early to tell.
----------x----------
If {CharName_21} said so, it
has to be true!
I wonder what kind of artist.{NextPage_49}
Maybe a metal sculptor like Cody?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, that's true. It's too early to say.{NextPage_49}
But if our child has an artistic sense
like {CharName_21} said, then I think
we have to be supportive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you scared me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well of course you can't beat {CharName_13},
he's much older than you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} is quite a fast runner.{NextPage_49}
{CharName_11} said so.
Could our child be an athlete?
{41_2_0}Maybe so.
Don't be silly.
----------x----------
{CharName_1} seems to like sports.
Maybe a pro athlete.{NextPage_49}
{CharName_13} would make a good
training partner, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe. But I've never seen a child
{CharName_1}'s age run like that.{NextPage_49}
That child seems to like sports. Maybe we
have a future athlete in the family.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That professor said he wants
{CharName_1} to be his
assistant.{NextPage_49}
I knew my child was smart!
{CharName_1}'s an scholar, I know it!
What do you think, {2d}?
{41_2_0}I agree.
The kid is just curious.
----------x----------
I knew you'd think so!
A scholar!{NextPage_49}
We have to do everything we can
to help out!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess so. {CharName_1}'s still a kid.{NextPage_49}
But if {CharName_1}'s interested in
something, I think it's our duty as
parents to be supportive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, I'm a little worried.
Is the everything going all right
with the farm?{NextPage_49}
I don't want to tell you your business,
but how are things going, really?
{41_2_0}I'm sorry. I'll try harder.
I don't want to do farm work.
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}You can't mean that.
{41_2_0}Of course not. I'll try harder.
I'm serious!
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}You really mean that?
{41_2_0}No. I'll try harder.
Of course I do!
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}So you're really serious?!
You don't care what happens to the farm?!
{41_2_0}I'm sorry. I'll try harder.
No, not really.
----------x----------
I feel a better now that you've
said that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, you scared me...
But I feel better now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Our child is growing up
and I'd like to remodel the house.
We're going to be OK, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_30}Wha-?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_30}B-but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_30}......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_7}...I understand.
Do whatever you want...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know what you're trying to say...{32_3_232}
----------x----------
But I just want you to listen to
what your father and I suggest, too.{32_3_232}
----------x----------
Hmph!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What book are you reading?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Would you like a snack or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You seem pretty serious. What is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Then why don't you just ask
your father?
I'm sure he'd be happy to show you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, that's true.{32_3_232} I've got it!{NextPage_49}
I'll ask him for you. Then
you can ask him yourself when you
get the chance, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
It's about {CharName_1}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} seems very interested in
your work.{NextPage_49}
So if {CharName_1} and asks you, I'd
like you to take some time for your child.
{41_2_0}Of course.
I'm too busy.
----------x----------
I knew you'd do it.{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_3}You're the best teacher
our child could possibly have.
I'm sure of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's why {CharName_1} didn't
want to ask you!{NextPage_49}
All right.{NextPage_49}
If you're really that busy, why not have
{CharName_1} help you?{52_0_0_0}
{39_1}Wouldn't that work?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
It's about {CharName_1}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm worried that {CharName_1} isn't very
interested in farm work. What do you say?
{41_2_0}Maybe not.
Of course my child is interested!
----------x----------
You think so too?{NextPage_49}
But if there's something else
{CharName_1} likes, that's fine too.
It's {CharName_1}'s life, after all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You think so?
If you say so, I guess maybe
it's true, but...{NextPage_49}
But if there's something else
{CharName_1} likes, that's fine too.
It's {CharName_1}'s life, after all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How have things been going recently?
The farm, I mean.
{41_2_0}It's going well.
Not great...
----------x----------
Really?{50_9_0_35}
Well, that's good.{NextPage_49}
It's just that {CharName_1}'s getting
bigger and all...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm... What're we going to do?
{50_9_0_9}{CharName_1} grows bigger every
day, too...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Music is nice, but you should help your
father out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Art is nice, but you should help your
father out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sports are nice, but you should help your
father out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Studying is nice, but you should help your
father out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know you like the farm, but you're
still young. You have to try doing lots
of things while you still can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh {2d}...
{50_9_0_9}{CharName_1} still hasn't come home.{NextPage_49}
And it's getting so late...{NextPage_49}
Where could that child be?
{41_2_0}I'll go looking.
{CharName_1} is an adult now.
----------x----------
Well, that's true.
But it's so late.
Couldn't you go out and have a look?
{41_2_0}Sure I'll go.
{CharName_1}'ll be back soon.
----------x----------
Yes, please do...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm. Listening to {CharName_27}'s guitar?
There's nothing wrong with music, but a
mother worries if her child's out so late.{NextPage_49}
That child certainly does like music.
Do we have a future musician on our hands?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm. If you say so...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh! {CharName_1}'s back!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where have you been?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm. Listening to {CharName_27}'s guitar?
There's nothing wrong with music, but a
mother worries if her child's out so late.{NextPage_49}
That child certainly does like music.
Do we have a future musician on our hands?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I ask you something strange?
{41_2_0}No.
Sure.
----------x----------
Why are you being so cold?!
I just want to ask a question!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well...
Do round things ever look square?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}???
Of course not.
----------x----------
You don't understand that either, do you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, that's what I thought.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The truth is, {CharName_1}
asked me that out of the blue...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you mean?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmmm. I wonder...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So that's what happened.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if our child might want to be an
artist. I think {CharName_1} is
quite talented.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK...
What should I do?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK. Ready?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ready... Set... Go!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Go {CharName_1}!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Finished!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_13} is pretty fast, isn't he?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
{50_9_0_9}{CharName_1} still isn't home.{NextPage_49}
It's so late. Where
could that child be!
{41_2_0}I'll go look.
{CharName_1} is an adult now.
----------x----------
Well, that's true.
But I'm still worried.
Could you go look?
{41_2_0}Alright, I'll go.
{CharName_1} will be back soon.
----------x----------
Please do...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_19} seems to like {CharName_1}...{NextPage_49}
Being interested in {CharName_19}'s research
is fine, but staying out at all hours...{NextPage_49}
I wonder if our child considers
becoming a scholar.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm. If you say so.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh! {CharName_1}'s back!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where have you been?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_19} seems to like {CharName_1}...{NextPage_49}
Being interested in {CharName_19}'s research
is fine, but staying out at all hours...{NextPage_49}
I wonder if our child considers
becoming a scholar.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing there by yourself?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why?{NextPage_49}
I don't know the details, but it was
before you were born...{NextPage_49}
I believe it was in the spring.
{CharName_7} and your father came
here.{NextPage_49}
But {CharName_7} had been here before, with
another man...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I only asked {CharName_7} about it once.{NextPage_49}
But that person was your father's father.
That makes him your grandfather.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't really know.{NextPage_49}
I never saw him again and
{CharName_7} won't tell me
any more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He doesn't seem to want to talk about
it. He just says he's working on the farm
in honor of your grandfather's memory.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?
I'm sure your father would be happy!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Eek!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You scared me.
Oh, it's you, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello. Is everyone on the farm
doing well?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_64}Where did I put that handkerchief...{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hm? {32_1_244}Well this is unusual.{32_1_244}
Both of you here together...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_12}Is there something wrong?
{41_2_0}It's nothing.
Love problems.
----------x----------
{50_9_0_30}Well! {32_1_244}A secret, is it?
{50_9_0_3}But, {32_1_244}I guess this is one of those
man-to-man talks I've heard about...{NextPage_1}Heehee. {32_1_244}I do feel a bit left out, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now where's that handkerchief?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_30}Really?{32_1_244}
{50_9_0_3}Are we talking about Kate, by any chance?{32_1_44}
Hee hee. {32_1_244}I could tell without asking.{u_805a}{NextPage_1}{50_9_0_9}But this could be a bit of problem...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_64}What is it?{32_1_244} What's with the yelling?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Oh...{32_1_244}
Hee hee. {32_1_244}So he likes her, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_1}It's great to find someone special.
I'm sure the time that he spends worrying
about it will be time well spent.{NextPage_1}Even if things don't work out...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}He'll be all right.{32_1_244} Won't he?
{50_9_0_26}This reminds me of how we used to be.
Back before we got married.{32_3_232} Hee hee.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um... {32_1_244}Hmm?{32_1_244} Now what was I doing before?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you looking at, dear?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you thinking about something...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's been a long time, hasn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}'s all grown up,
and we're both older.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why, your hair's turned all white
and you're all wrinkly! Hee hee.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
{41_2_0}You're wrinkly too.
You're as beautiful as ever.
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}How rude.{32_7_208}
{50_9_0_3}I guess we're not young anymore.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}My...
You're certainly being nice today...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}But we still have work to do.
{CharName_7} still works so hard every day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dear... dear... What's wrong?
!?
Dear! {CharName_0}!!{NextPage_49}
{CharName_1}! Call {CharName_31} here
right away!!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hang in there...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How is he?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No... No PLEASE! NO!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh my, a {13}Blue Feather{17}.
It's not for me is it?
{41_2_0}Give it to her.
Don't give it to her.
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}Why you...!
You're just teasing me, aren't you?{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_26}I did get a little excited, though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}No, I didn't think so.
....But..........
{50_9_0_26}I did get a little excited...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}You're so mean.
I can't accept something like that yet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_0}Oh, you haven't proposed yet?
{50_9_0_3}Good luck.
I'm behind you all the way.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}You silly goose.
You're supposed to give that to the
person that you want to marry!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a {13}Blue Feather{17}, right?
{50_9_0_10}I wonder who you're going to propose to...
{50_9_0_3}Good luck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Really? But...
I need to talk to Auntie Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Yes.
{50_9_0_7}I'm still fairly young, after all.
I hope whomever you propose to says yes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I hope...
I hope whomever you propose to says yes...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's right.
What should we do?
What should I call you, {CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1},
isn't that nice.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}{CharName_1},
you're all clean now{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, Why don't you give
poor {CharName_1} a bath?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I didn't think you were here.
But there you are.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take it easy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
ÄIt's a kind of male bonding, you know.Ö{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Auntie Romana, Sebastian,
thank you so much for everything.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll do my best.
I'll work hard to be a good wife for
{CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sebastian...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, ducks are in our pond...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where could they have come from?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't we keep them?
{41_2_0}Keep them.
Don't keep them.
----------x----------
Good!
Well, we'd better give them names.
What should we name the male?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's too bad.
I guess we'd better let them go...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Input_128}?{32_3_232}
And what about the female?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Input_128}?{32_3_232}
We'd better show them the {Location_43_21_23}.{NextPage_0}
