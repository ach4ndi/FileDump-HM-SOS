I like to think of
everyone who comes
here as my children. {NextPage_49}
...So, don't you
think it's sad if
they don't even{NextPage_1}say goodbye when
they leave? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if {CharName_4}
is eating well now.
She ate a lot here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm...
I don't think it
tastes bad. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hold on a minute.
You came at just
the right time. {NextPage_49}
Would you try out
this dish I made? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm trying to make
new recipes.{NextPage_49}
It's hard to tell
the difference just
by looking, but {NextPage_1}you'll find the
flavors have changed
just a little. {NextPage_49}
Pick any you like.
{41_3_0}Red one.
Green one.
Dessert.
----------x----------
Wonderful!
I was too scared to
try it myself. {NextPage_49}
Thanks for helping
me with that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What!?
I think the wrong
flavor is in it. {NextPage_49}
I was too scared to
try it myself. {NextPage_49}
Thanks for helping
me with that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Smells good, doesn't
it? {NextPage_49}
It's Nami's birthday
today, so I'm making
my special dinner. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today is Nami's
birthday, right? {NextPage_49}
That's why I'm
making my special
dinner tonight. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wait in your room
until I'm prepared. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_0}.
You came at just the
right time... {NextPage_49}
I was thinking of
changing up the menu.{NextPage_49}
So, would you taste
something for me? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you think?
Hmm? {NextPage_49}
You say you've never
had food this good
before? {NextPage_49}
That's good to hear.
Thank you. {NextPage_49}
Actually I put some
special seasoning
in it. {NextPage_49}
I had bought it when
my Husband and I
traveled to a {NextPage_1}country in the far
far far far North. {NextPage_49}
I had to go through
a lot make it again. {NextPage_49}
If you like, I'll
give you one. {NextPage_1}Just wait one
moment, okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Here it is.
Enjoy it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't need
anything in return. {NextPage_1}Well, come see
me again sometime,
okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you seen {CharName_4}
at all today?
{41_2_0}I've seen her.
Haven't seen her.
----------x----------
W-w-w-where did
you see her? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wanted her to be
here longer. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought {CharName_4}
had left
{Location_43_30_23}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really!
Well I can't sit
and daydream here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can cook for you
anytime. Oh, good...{NextPage_49}
You can stay in
{Location_43_30_23}
now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take care of {CharName_4}.
Since she came here
she's been unruly. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you seen {CharName_4}
at all today?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0},
I'm counting on you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_0}.
How are you? {32_1_244}
Are you hungry? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't you cook
at home?
{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_1}If that's so,
I'll give you
something good. {NextPage_49}
Wait just a second.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_7}Oh, that's too bad. {32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
{50_25_0_1}Then give it to your
wife.
Wait just a second. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_1}I got this spice
when I was traveling
here and there in {NextPage_1}the southern part
of the world. {NextPage_49}
It's a little spicy,{32_1_244}
but it mixes well
with other flavors. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}{CharName_0}, are you
hungry? {NextPage_49}
Go home {32_1_244}and have a
delicious meal... {32_1_244}
Bye-bye. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_35}{CharName_0}...
Your time here as
too fast... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, can we
have a song in
memory of {CharName_0}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pardon me... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got nothing
to sell tody? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nothing here.
Can't be helped. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let me take a
look around. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_35}Not really anything
good here, is there?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm just looking... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really like that
{29_0}.
How much is it?
{41_3_2}For you? {2a_1_5}G.
{2a_2_5}G.
Not for sale.
----------x----------
{50_25_0_10}Really!
That's a great deal. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll take it.
Thanks... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a little
high, but whatever.
I'll take it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Never mind.
I don't want it
anyway. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want that {29_0}.
How much is it?
{41_3_2}For you? {2a_1_5}G
{2a_2_5}G
Not for sale
----------x----------
That's it for me
for today. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How is life on
the farm?
Is it doing well? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_2}I don't feel good
today. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_2}Could you please
leave me alone today?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_4}I'm a little angry
today. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_120}Mornin'.
How are ya? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_120}Hello, hello. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_120}What are you doing
out and about this
late at night? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_120}What are you doing
out and about this
late at night? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_120}Make yourself at
home. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey...
Take it easy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's my favorite
food.
Can I have it? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_120}Are you sure?
{50_25_0_10}I like you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_26}Pardon me.
That was very bold
of me to ask? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I have that? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_120}That looks good... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got something
good there... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_9}I can't eat that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_9}I like most dishes,
but that shouldn't
even be called food. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_9}Forgive me, I can't
eat that... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_2}I don't want that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_10}He's so cute.
He looks just like
Celia... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_10}How old are you,
baby? {NextPage_49}
{50_25_0_10}{32_5_220}How old are you? {32_5_220}
{50_25_0_35}No reaction... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_10}He's so cute. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Grow up big and
strong like your
daddy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_10}He's so cute.
He looks just like
Muffy... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_10}He's so cute.
He looks just like
Nami... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a good
looking dog you
have there. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_35}Shake! {32_5_220}
Shake! {NextPage_49}
{32_5_220}{50_25_0_9}Maybe he doesn't
like me...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute dog. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Here kitty kitty.
You're so cute... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a good
chicken you've got
there. {NextPage_49}
It'll give you
lots of good eggs. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How cute. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is it true that if
you raise a chicken
with great care, {NextPage_1}someday it will
lay golden eggs
for you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you know that
ducks can't warm
their own eggs? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute duck. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ducks really are
cute if you take
a good look at them. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of
seed is that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Vesta sells all kinds
of seeds. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what will
grow from that
seed. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are those crops from
your farm? {NextPage_49}
I wouldn't mind
getting a few
from you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are so many
varieties of crops
you can grow. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that cheese
on you farm, right? {NextPage_49}
I think it would go
well with any dish. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A cheese's flavor
varies depending on
the milk used. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What came first,
the chicken or
the egg? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Eggs are so useful.
You can use them
in all cooking. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's really hard
for me to tell the
difference between {NextPage_1}a ducks egg and a
chickens egg. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you catch that
fish?
You're good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are all types
of fish dishes but
you really need a {NextPage_1}delicious fresh
fish to make the
meal. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nice fresh fish. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are wild
grasses that grow
around here. {NextPage_49}
They would be a
great addition to
any dish. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That would go really
good with a tempura
and vegetable dish. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Unique plants grow in
Forget-Me-Not Valley.{NextPage_49}
That's just one
of them. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks good.
Did you cook that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That dish looks
delicious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a hoe that
we had at home.{NextPage_49}
It's so weird,
we try not to use
it. {NextPage_49}
It's kind of
pointless when
you think about it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd be happy if you
were to use it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a strange
hoe. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's Vesta's,
isn't it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe has a lot
of years on it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a nice hoe. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You really need to
use your tools
a lot more. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You really need to
use that more. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that your hoe?
It looks well used. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks very easy
to use. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a strange
sickle. {NextPage_49}
It looks a little
unwieldy... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a strange
sickle. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That sickle looks
very sharp. {NextPage_49}
Don't go spinning
it around in here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_35}It's dangerous to
spin that around
here... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that your
sickle? {NextPage_49}
You've used that
a lot haven't you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that...
a watering can? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a strange
watering can. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a strange
machine... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you do
with that...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are shears. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You should cut
someone's hair
with that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_35}You don't have to
cut my hair. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you cut someone's
hair with that,
you'll hurt them. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_35}Don't cut your son's
hair with that
either. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That tool has been
used a great deal...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a very
unusual stone... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What...is...that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's mysterious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a record.
You don't see many
of them lately. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's not a toy
to play catch with. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you think?
Do you like it?
{41_3_1}It's yummy.
Not really.
How do you use it?
----------x----------
{50_25_0_10}That's good.
It's for people who
like stimulating {NextPage_1}flavors hitting
their taste buds. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_9}Oh...
I guess it doesn't
agree with you... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Try mixing it with
some vegetables in
a nice stew. {NextPage_49}
You'll get a very
nice curry as a
result. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a very rare
spice. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}I thought I had rare
items at home, but
that's one thing {NextPage_1}that I've never
seen in my entire
life. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that Wally's
medal? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why would Wally
give that up...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A strange necklace
indeed. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't think it
would look good on
me... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that...?
Hmm... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What about it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a nice big
firework. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Having a fireworks
show are you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you give
that as a present
to someone? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_35}I don't want it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm thinking about
visiting Mineral Town
again to look for{NextPage_1}more ingredients for
my cooking...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've been cooking

Before we came here
I used to travel all
around the world. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love traveling
around finding new
recipes. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We've been together
while we traveled,
but we weren't {NextPage_1}always properly
married. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just between you and
me, I heard the
farmer in Mineral{NextPage_1}Town is very greedy.
Don't tell anyone...{NextPage_0}
