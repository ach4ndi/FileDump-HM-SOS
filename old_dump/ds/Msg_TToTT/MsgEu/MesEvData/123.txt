\u1f46\u1fbd\u1f48\u2136Is this for me?\u2328How nice of you.\u2328Thanks!
\u1f46\u1fbd\u1f48\u2136A birthday present?\u2328Um, what to say...?\u2328Honestly, I don't like it.
\u1f46\u1fbd\u1f48\u2136I just can't stand this.\u2328But I'll take it off your\u2328hands.
\u1f46\u1fbd\u1f48\u2136No, not \u206dcorn cereal\u206c!\u2328I know it's nutritious,\u2328but I hate eating it...\u232bI'm sorry to say, this is\u2328a terrible present.
\u1f46\u1fbd\u1f48\u2136Hi, kiddo.
\u1f46\u1fbd\u1f48\u2136Is life with Hiro all\u2328that you hoped for,\u2328\u232a?\u232bYou are one lucky girl,\u2328getting to eat his home-\u2328cooked meals every day...
\u1f46\u1fbd\u1f48\u2136It looks like marriage is\u2328treating you well, \u232a.\u232bI hope I meet my Mr. Right\u2328someday... *sigh*
\u1f46\u1fbd\u1f4b\u2136I hope everyone has the good\u2328sense to stay indoors today.\u2328It's dangerous out there.
\u1f46\u1fbd\u1f4a\u2136This snow is terribly heavy.\u2328Stay inside and keep warm!
\u1f46\u1fbd\u1f49\u2136\u232a, I'm glad\u2328to be friends with you.\u232bSince meeting you, I feel\u2328like I've learned a lot.\u2328Let's stay friends!
\u1f46\u1fbd\u1f48\u2136In Konohana, people rarely\u2328get sick.\u232bIt's probably all the clean\u2328air and fresh crops. It\u2328certainly makes my job easy!
\u1f46\u1fbd\u1f49\u2136How are things on your\u2328farm? Could I come by and\u2328see it some time?\u232bI'm interested to see what\u2328farming life is like.
\u1f46\u1fbd\u1f49\u2136I'm always happy to see you,\u2328\u232a. You're good\u2328company.
\u1f46\u1fbd\u1f48\u2136Let me know if you ever\u2328get injured.\u232bThe faster you treat an\u2328injury, the better it's\u2328likely to heal.
\u1f46\u1fbd\u1f48\u2136Are you hurt? Anything\u2328wrong with you? If so, let\u2328me know.
\u1f46\u1fbd\u1f48\u2136Come on in.\u2328Make yourself some tea\u2328if you'd like.

\u1f46\u1fbd\u1f48\u2136Good morning, \u232a.\u2328\u232bI have low blood sugar, so\u2328mornings are tough for me...\u2328I'm always sleepy...

\u1f46\u1fbd\u1f48\u2136Evening, \u232a.\u232bIt's time to be getting to\u2328bed. A doctor should set a\u2328good example.
