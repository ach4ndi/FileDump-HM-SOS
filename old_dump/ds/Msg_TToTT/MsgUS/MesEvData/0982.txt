\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135Hey, do you remember that\u2328lamb you helped me with\u2328the other day?
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135Ever since you talked to\u2328her, she hasn't tried to run\u2328away.
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f49\u2135Hey, do you want to come\u2328and see her now?\u2328\u232bI know Snow would\u2328be happy to see you!
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f49\u2135She really likes you.\u2328
\u2332 Protect Snow.\u2328 Watch what happens.
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2135What was that?
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2135I think that cow was just\u2328trying to make friends with\u2328Snow.
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f4b\u2135I know you've got a bond,\u2328but I think you're being a\u2328little overprotective.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135Helping out all the\u2328time isn't always right.\u232bIt's important to let\u2328her stand on her own four\u2328legs sometimes.
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f49\u2135Sorry. That was kind of\u2328obnoxious of me.
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135Oh, you've been here a\u2328while. You should probably\u2328be getting home.\u232bThanks for coming today.\u2328
\u1f40\u1fb3\u1f4b\u2135......
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f49\u2135You two seem to be getting\u2328along well.
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135I thought you might be the\u2328type who rushes in to help\u2328even when it's not needed.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f49\u2135But you were wonderful.\u2328You really know the animals.\u2328I shouldn't have worried.
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135I really owe you my thanks.
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135For Snow, I mean.\u2328She's been doing so well\u2328since she met you...\u232b\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f49\u2135She's even getting along\u2328with the other animals now.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135Without your help, Snow\u2328might still be an unhappy\u2328little lamb.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f49\u2135So I wanted to thank you.
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135You always make me realize\u2328just how far I have to go\u2328to be a great farmer.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f4a\u2135Trying to measure up to\u2328you is a great motivator!
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f49\u2135I guess that's one of the\u2328reasons I'm always happy\u2328to spend time with you.
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2135Oh no!\u2328I didn't realize how late\u2328it had gotten.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f49\u2135Time always flies when I'm\u2328with you.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135Sorry to keep you so long.\u2328Let me walk you home.
\u1f40\u1fb3\u1f4b\u2135......
