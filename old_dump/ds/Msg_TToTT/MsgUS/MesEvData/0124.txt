\u1f46\u1fbe\u1f4b\u2136Oh, thank you.\u2328But why would you give me\u2328something like this?
\u1f46\u1fbe\u1f4a\u2136I don't like this at all. At\u2328least Ying likes it. I'll\u2328have to give it to her.
\u1f46\u1fbe\u1f48\u2136Hello, dearie.
\u1f46\u1fbe\u1f48\u2136Hello, dearie.
\u1f46\u1fbe\u1f48\u2136In a marriage, you need to\u2328consider each other's needs.\u2328Don't forget that!
\u1f46\u1fbe\u1f4b\u2136Won't this wind ever die\u2328down? Ying is terrified.
\u1f46\u1fbe\u1f48\u2136Such a lot of snow!\u2328Plenty to frolic in,\u2328so Ying will be happy.
\u1f46\u1fbe\u1f49\u2136\u232a, it's always so\u2328good to see you stopping by.\u2328Thank you, dearie.\u232bI feel like I have two\u2328grandchildren.
\u1f46\u1fbe\u1f48\u2136My husband passed away a\u2328long time ago.\u232bWhen I was grieving, all the\u2328villagers were there for me.\u232b\u1f46\u1fbe\u1f49\u2136I wanted to repay their\u2328kindness, so I opened my\u2328tea house.
\u1f46\u1fbe\u1f48\u2136Ying is in delicate health.\u2328It's best for her to have a\u2328quiet life in our fresh air.\u232bSo her parents asked me to\u2328care for her for a while.
\u1f46\u1fbe\u1f49\u2136I buy the crops I cook with\u2328here from Gombe.\u232bThat man grows delicious\u2328crops, I'll tell you.

\u1f46\u1fbe\u1f48\u2136My shop means everything to\u2328me.\u232bI suppose just as your farm\u2328does to you, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fbe\u1f48\u2136I'm sorry, the tea house is\u2328closed today.
