\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Did you know that horses\u2328grow winter coats?\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Dakota's winter coat is\u2328so thick and soft. She's\u2328so cute!

\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Dakota and I went for\u2328a ride in the woods.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136There was this guy riding\u2328slowly in front of us,\u2328so we passed him.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4a\u2136Then he came galloping real\u2328hard to try and catch up,\u2328and it turned in a race.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Goodness, I hadn't had a\u2328good race like that in ages!\u2328\u232bOf course, Dakota and I\u2328licked him good!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136Cooking is really hard...\u232bMy cooking never seems to\u2328come out right!\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4a\u2136But I'm not going to give\u2328up just yet!\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136I'll cook something real\u2328delicious one of these\u2328days!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136I have so many memories\u2328of this place.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136I used to come here all the\u2328time--when I was happy,\u2328and when I was sad, too.\u232bIt's one of my favorite\u2328places!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Every year, the village\u2328holds the Hand Fishing\u2328Contest.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Everyone tries really hard\u2328to win, so it's always a\u2328lot of fun!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136I moved here when\u2328I was little.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Jessica brings me snacks\u2328a lot, and they're always\u2328so delicious!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136I'd rather wear practical\u2328clothes than some fancy\u2328dress any day.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136People in the village come\u2328by to rent our horses a lot.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136You have so much freedom in\u2328this village. You can do\u2328anything you want.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136I moved here when I was\u2328little.\u232bI didn't know anyone, and\u2328Laney was the first person\u2328to talk to me.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136She's such a sweet girl.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136The tea Rose makes is so\u2328delicious.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136She knows all about\u2328different kinds of tea.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Laney says that I should\u2328dress up more...\u2328\u232bWhat do you think?\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136I think I'd feel a might\u2328foolish all dressed up.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136People in the village come\u2328by to rent our horses a lot.\u232bThe other day, Enrique\u2328rented a horse to go and\u2328stock items for his shop.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136It must be tough to have to\u2328go all over the countryside\u2328like that...
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Ash is a really good older\u2328brother to Cheryl.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136He babies her a little too\u2328much sometimes, but that's\u2328not the worst thing.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Laney can be surprisingly\u2328ditzy sometimes.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136It's always surprising when\u2328a girl who's so down-to-\u2328earth does something silly!\u232bBut it's also pretty cute!\u2328
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Anything Laney bakes is\u2328absolutely delicious!\u232bI bake with her a lot, and\u2328she knows just about\u2328everything about baking.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136She really loves it!\u2328
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136Jessica gave me a skirt\u2328the other day...\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4b\u2136But I'm a might embarrassed.\u232bI don't really wear skirts\u2328very often...
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136People in the village come\u2328by to rent our horses a lot.\u232bJessica came to rent one\u2328the other day...\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136And you could tell she's\u2328used to being around horses!\u232bHer horse shied and she was\u2328able to calm him right down!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Cheryl is a might\u2328precocious, but she's a\u2328good kid.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136She really thinks the world\u2328of her big brother...\u2328
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136When we were kids, we stayed\u2328the night in the barn to\u2328prove how brave we were...\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136Ash and I played a real mean\u2328trick on Laney, and locked\u2328her in the barn...\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4b\u2136Laney doesn't hold it\u2328against us anymore, but...\u232bI remember how hard she was\u2328crying. It was really mean,\u2328what we did to her.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Jessica gave me a real\u2328easy recipe to try.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136I hope you'll come over\u2328and help me taste it when\u2328I try to make it, now!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136Laney is always telling me\u2328I should dress up more...\u2328What do you think?\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4b\u2136I reckon I'd be\u2328too embarrassed...
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136People in the village come\u2328by to rent our horses a lot.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136Why, I always get nervous\u2328watching Eileen.\u232bShe always looks like she's\u2328about to fall off.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Jessica raises a family and\u2328runs a farm all on her\u2328own...\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136She's really something.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136I can talk to Laney about\u2328just about anything.\u2328\u232bLaney will be my best friend\u2328forever. I can't see \u2328anything breaking us up.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136I'll bet we'll still be\u2328friends even when we're\u2328great grandmothers!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136I made cold tofu earlier.\u232bIt came out fine, but...\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4b\u2136I reckon it just didn't\u2328have enough taste for me...
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136My dad gave me some\u2328perfume the other day.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136Well, I was mighty surprised\u2328because he never gives me\u2328anything fancy like that.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4d\u2136Now what do you suppose\u2328possessed him to do that?\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136It feels a little silly,\u2328but I guess I'll try using\u2328it.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136People in the village come\u2328by to rent our horses a lot.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136Howard just loves horses.\u2328He always makes up pet names\u232bfor them.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136It makes me real glad to see\u2328our horses being treated so\u2328well.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Sometimes I couldn't tell\u2328you what's going through\u2328my dad's head, but...\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136He's a real good father.\u2328I know he loves me a lot.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Eileen comes to do repairs\u2328on the roof of our barn\u2328from time to time.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136She's a real craftswoman.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136Even if nails do fall down\u2328from the roof sometimes...
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Everyone in this village has\u2328a real nice smile, I think.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136You can tell everybody's\u2328got a good heart!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Eileen is the village\u2328carpenter.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136You just ask her if you\u2328need anything!\u2328
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136When I was younger, my dad\u2328took me to watch a horse\u2328race.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136I just love to watch horses\u2328run. I wish we could have\u2328a horse race here...
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136\u232a...\u232bYou're...\u270b\u2328\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136real interesting!\u232bLet's talk again soon!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136The other day, I asked\u2328Howard what his favorite\u2328animal is.\u232bHe said he likes rabbits\u2328the best.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136Rabbits?\u232bI think tigers are better.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Of course, I like horses\u2328better than rabbits or\u2328tigers...
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Everyone in this village has\u2328a real nice smile, I think.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Especially Laney!\u232bWhen she smiles, everyone\u2328else smiles too.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Eileen is a really skilled\u2328craftswoman.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136But she's also a little\u2328clumsy...
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4d\u2136You...\u232bSure are handsome...\u232b...\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136I actually said that to this\u2328handsome horse I saw.\u232bI just can't help staring\u2328at a real handsome horse...
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136\u232a...\u232bYou're...\u270b\u2328\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136real sweet!\u232bCome talk to me again soon!\u2328
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136My dad is something else.\u2328\u232bHe's the finest judge of\u2328horses in the world!\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136I'm going to work hard so\u2328I know just as much about\u2328horses as he does!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48Everyone in this village has\u2328a real nice laugh, I think.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Especially Howard!\u2328\u232bI always hear him laughing\u2328in the town square. He has\u2328a real distinctive laugh.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Eileen is a really skilled\u2328craftswoman.\u232bShe's so petite, but she's\u2328strong enough to pick up\u2328lumber with one hand!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4d\u2136Your eyes...\u232bwon't let me look away...\u2328\u232b...\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136I actually said that to a\u2328horse I saw who had these\u2328beautiful eyes.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Some horses have such\u2328beautiful eyes!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136\u232a...\u232bYou're...\u270b\u2328\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136so sweet.\u232bI'm always impressed by\u2328how thoughtful you are.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Do you think there really\u2328is something under the\u2328mayor's hat?\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136I'm dying to know...
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Everyone in this village has\u2328a real nice laugh, I think.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136And so do you, \u232a!\u2328\u2328
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Eileen is such a\u2328skilled carpenter.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136She's had a lot of\u2328apprentices, I hear.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136None of them last very long,\u2328though. I guess her work\u2328style is pretty...unique.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4d\u2136I want us...\u232bto be partners\u2328for life...\u232b...\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136That's the conversation I\u2328had with a horse in the\u2328dream I had last night.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4b\u2136Why would I say that, even\u2328in a dream, when I've\u2328got my darling Dakota?\u232bD'you reckon I spend too\u2328much time thinking about\u2328horses?
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136\u232a...\u232b\u232a...\u270b\u2328\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4d\u2136You're really great.\u232bEveryone thinks so!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136Diego is something else!\u232bI can almost never bargain\u2328him down.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4b\u2136He really knows his\u2328business.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136It's so important to laugh.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136If you can't laugh, then\u2328you can't be living right.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Eileen is such a skilled\u2328carpenter.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136I heard that there's a\u2328craftsman in Konohana who\u2328Eileen really looks up to.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136I wonder who it is?
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4d\u2136You're so gorgeous, and\u2328so strong, and so smart.\u232bI want to be with you\u2328forever...\u232bLet's never part.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136That's the conversation I\u2328had with a horse in the\u2328dream I had last night.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136Isn't that just ridiculous?\u2328I'm not that much of a\u2328horse fanatic...\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4b\u2136Why did I dream something\u2328like that? Maybe I'm\u2328working too hard...
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4d\u2136...\u2328Um...\u232bSo if you want to...\u2328\u232bI'd love it if we could talk\u2328like this again sometime\u2328soon.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Thanks!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136I can't rightly remember\u2328just how long we've known\u2328each other, \u2391.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Time just passes so quickly\u2328when I'm with you.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4d\u2136I hope we can keep talking\u2328like this forever.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Sound good?
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136\u2391...\u232bIt warms my heart to\u2328see you looking so well!\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Of course work is work, but\u2328I want you to take care of\u2328yourself! Promise, now!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136\u2391...\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136I just wanted to thank you\u2328for being with me.\u232bSorry for always talking\u2328about horses!\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4d\u2136I get nervous when I talk\u2328about you...\u2328
