\u1f40\u1fbe\u1f49\u2135Oh, it's \u232a.\u2328Welcome, dearie!\u232b\u1f41\u1fbb\u1f48\u2136We were just talking about\u2328the good old days!
\u1f41\u1fbb\u1f48\u2136Yun's husband was a very\u2328good friend of mine, you\u2328see. We were inseparable!\u232b\u1f40\u1fbe\u1f49\u2135Oh, I get a bit embarrassed\u2328when I talk about my\u2328husband...
\u1f41\u1fbb\u1f49\u2136When he passed away, I was\u2328worried about how you would\u2328make it through.\u232bFortunately, you were able\u2328to bounce back.\u232b\u1f40\u1fbe\u1f49\u2135Well, that was thanks to the\u2328kindness of everyone in the\u2328village...\u232bAnd I'm still so grateful\u2328that I can run my little\u2328tea house here.\u232b\u1f41\u1fbb\u1f48\u2136Since I was a close friend\u2328of her husband's, I wanted\u2328to encourage Yun somehow.\u232b\u1f40\u1fbe\u1f49\u2135And my, how grateful I am!\u232b\u1f41\u1fbb\u1f49\u2136Oh, it's nothing! Everyone\u2328wants the people they love\u2328to be happy!
\u1f41\u1fbb\u1f48\u2136A-Anyway, I should get\u2328going...
\u1f41\u1fbb\u1f48\u2136This was fun, but I'd better\u2328get home now...
\u1f41\u1fbb\u1f48\u2136See you later, \u232a.
\u1f40\u1fbe\u1f48\u2135Whenever I see Gombe, it\u2328reminds me of my husband.\u232bIn those days, I never\u2328imagined life without\u2328my husband...\u232bStill, remembering the good\u2328times today was nice...
\u1f40\u1fbe\u1f49\u2135Don't ever take your spouse\u2328for granted, \u232a...\u232bAlways treasure your loved\u2328ones!
\u1f40\u1fbe\u1f49\u2135I hope you find that special\u2328someone, \u232a...
