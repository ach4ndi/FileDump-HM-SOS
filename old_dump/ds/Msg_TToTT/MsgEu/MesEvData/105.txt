\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136You're new around here.\u2328I'm \u206eLaney\u206c.\u2328Nice to meet you.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Wasn't the weather terrible\u2328yesterday? I'm glad the\u2328house wasn't damaged.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Oh, how cute! I think it\u2328likes me!
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136I don't really like it.\u2328I'm sorry...
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136What? This is for me?\u2328This is so sudden...\u2328I don't know what to say...\u232b\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Let's go somewhere and talk\u2328this over.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136So that's a Blue Feather...\u2328Who're you giving\u2328it to?\u232bWhoever it is, I hope\u2328you're happy together.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136That's for me?\u2328I don't really have any\u2328reason to accept it...
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136Thank you, but I simply\u2328couldn't accept another\u2328gift today.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Oh, Harmony Day chocolate!\u2328Thank you, \u232a.\u232b\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I'll make some for you too.\u2328\u232b\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136So look forward to Winter\u2328Harmony Day!
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Oh, Harmony Day chocolate!\u2328Thank you, \u232a.\u232b\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Make sure you don't forget\u2328to give some to your wife!
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136What is it?
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Thank you for remembering\u2328my birthday, \u232a!\u2328And \u206dCherry Pie\u206c\u232bis my favorite!\u2328This is perfect!
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136\u206dCherry Pie\u206c!?\u2328That's my favorite!\u232b\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Thank you, \u232a.\u2328This is wonderful!
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Thanks! You remembered my\u2328birthday! And what a nice\u2328gift, too!\u232bYou're so sweet!
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136That's one of my favorite\u2328things!\u232b\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Thanks!\u2328This makes me really happy!
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Thanks for remembering\u2328my birthday.\u2328
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136This is for me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Oh, thanks!
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136It was sweet of you to\u2328remember my birthday...\u2328\u232b\u1f46\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136But I don't actually...\u2328Well, I guess I'll take it,\u2328since you got it for me...
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Huh? That's for me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136It's not my favorite, but\u2328since you got it for me...
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136Eek! A locust!?\u2328I don't want that!\u232bYou really want me to have\u2328it? Well okay then, but next\u2328time, remember I hate them!
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Hey, how are you getting\u2328along with Cam?\u232bHe's usually so shy. I'm\u2328glad he found someone he\u2328can open up to.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Do you have any tips for\u2328making marriage last?\u232bYou seem so happy.\u2328I guess you just need love.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136You should stay inside on\u2328a day like today!\u232bThis wind is almost strong\u2328enough to blow you away!
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Normally, I love to be\u2328out in the snow...\u2328\u232b\u1f46\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136But this storm is too\u2328intense. I'm afraid I'd be\u2328buried!
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Are you going to stay here\u2328forever?\u232bIf you ever move to the\u2328city, you have to invite me!\u232bIt's my dream to open a\u2328bakery there someday.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Do you like sweet things?\u2328\u232bOf course you do! I don't\u2328know anyone who doesn't like\u2328sweet things!\u232b\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Especially the things that I\u2328bake!
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I bake to make people\u2328happy.\u232bSo I hope you'll have\u2328something sweet when you\u2328come into the shop.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136My dad really likes you,\u2328\u232a.\u232bI know he's kind of strange,\u2328but I hope you'll come chat\u2328with him sometime.\u232bHe'll probably cook for\u2328you then.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136How do you like living here?\u232bIf you have any problems,\u2328talk to Rutger about\u2328them.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136My dad's food is our shop's\u2328claim to fame.\u232bThe things I bake are really\u2328good too, though. You\u2328should try one sometime.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Just make yourself at home.\u2328
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136\u232a...\u2328Isn't there something\u2328you want to say to me?
\u2332 I'm sorry. I apologize.\u2328 Not really.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136That's okay. As long as you\u2328understand why I was mad.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f4a\u2136Oh, is that so? Well, fine.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136That was some storm\u2328yesterday! I'm glad our\u2328house wasn't damaged.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Ooh, a Harmony Day present?\u2328Thanks! That's so sweet!\u232b\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136I'm going to think up\u2328something wonderful\u2328to give you in return!
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Ooh, a birthday present?\u232b\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136I'm so happy you remembered!\u2328And...you gave me my most\u2328favorite thing!
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Ooh, a present for me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Oh, this is...\u2328It's my favorite!\u2328Thanks! That's so sweet!\u2328
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f4d\u2136Why don't we go for a\u2328walk together, \u2391?
\u2332 Okay, let's go.\u2328 Let's not today.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Oh, I see.\u2328Well, if you don't want\u2328to, then we won't.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Ooh, a birthday present?\u232b\u1f46\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136Thank you. But don't you\u2328think you should remember\u2328what I don't like by now?
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Is that for me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136Thanks, but don't you think\u2328you should remember what I\u2328don't like by now?
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I'm going to be a mother...\u2328Somehow it hasn't really\u2328sunk in yet...
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136You're going to be a\u2328father, \u2391.\u2328I know you'll be wonderful.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I've started to feel the\u2328baby kicking! It's very\u2328strong and healthy!\u232bNot too much longer now...
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136It's so wonderful to have\u2328something to look forward to\u2328every day.\u232bI always look forward to\u2328a new day with you.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136You work so hard. Make sure\u2328you take care of yourself.\u2328\u232bIt might be good to stay at\u2328home and rest sometimes.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I want to bake you something\u2328really special...\u2328\u232b\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Just wait. I'm going to cook\u2328up something new for you.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I wanted to bake you \u2328something really special...\u232bBut nothing's come out\u2328quite right yet.\u232bI'll just have to keep\u2328trying!
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I'm not only a good baker,\u2328I can cook, too.\u2328\u232bMy dad's been showing me\u2328all his cooking secrets.\u2328\u232b\u1f46\u1fab\u1f4d\u2136After all, I love you, and\u2328I want to make something\u2328delicious for you every day.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136It's not easy taking\u2328care of our own house.\u232bBut I think we're\u2328doing pretty well...
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I think we have a pretty\u2328good marriage.\u232bAt least, I'm enjoying it.\u2328
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Maybe the secret to a happy\u2328marriage is not to overthink\u2328things...
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136You're different now that\u2328we're married.\u232b\u1f46\u1fab\u1f4b\u2136It makes me a little sad.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f4b\u2136I don't want to talk to you,\u2328\u2391.
\u2332 I'm sorry. Don't be mad.\u2328 Suit yourself.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I guess I'll forgive you.\u2328It still bugs me a little...\u2328But I suppose it's fine.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136...
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Don't you beed that for the\u2328\u1000 today?\u2328\u232bMake sure you hold it\u2328carefully...
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Is this your pet?\u2328How cute!
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Oooh.\u2328Very cute!♪\u2328Where'd you find it?
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136Eek!\u2328Don't get so close!
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Where'd you find that?\u2328It's so funny looking.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Oh, what a nice outfit!\u2328I really like it!
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136By the way, are you free\u2328right now? Let's go for\u2328a walk.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Do you have time to chat?\u2328
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I wanted to talk to you\u2328about something.\u2328Are you free right now?
\u2332 Yeah, okay.\u2328 No thanks.
\u2332 Sure thing.\u2328 Not today.
\u2332 Sure. What's up?\u2328 Not right now...
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f4d\u2136Oh, okay.\u2328I know how busy you are,\u2328\u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Oh, that's okay, then.\u2328I just wanted to chat.\u2328
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Oh.\u2328Maybe next time, then.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Ooh, what pretty flowers!\u2328Oh right, it's Flower Day.\u2328Thank you.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136It's so nice to get flowers\u2328from your husband.\u2328
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136\u232a, would you like\u2328to come to my house for\u2328the Starry Night Festival?
\u2332 Yeah, that sounds good!\u2328 No, that's okay.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Really?\u2328Thanks!\u232bCome to my dad's caf at\u23288 PM tomorrow.\u2328I'll be waiting!
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Oh, okay.\u2328I'll see you around, then.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136I'm so excited for tomorrow!\u2328
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136Oh, it's wrapped so nicely!\u2328What is it?\u2328
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136It's so reassuring having\u2328you around. I hope you stay\u2328here forever.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Make yourself at home!
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I'll be here all day, so\u2328just make yourself at home.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Can I help you with\u2328anything?
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Things are a little busy,\u2328but make yourself at home.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136It was so nice and warm out,\u2328I decided to go for a walk.\u2328\u232bIsn't the village especially\u2328pretty this time of year?
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136It can get hot this time of\u2328year, but that just makes\u2328the breeze feel extra nice.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136It can get cold this time of\u2328year, but the snow\u2328is so pretty.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136It's so late already!\u2328The days go so quickly when\u2328I'm not working...
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I like to use my days off to\u2328get outside and just wander.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why don't you come in and\u2328have something to eat?\u2328We've got sweet things, too.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136I thought I'd go for a walk\u2328since I'm not working today.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Did you have fun at the\u2328Cooking Festival today?\u232bI hope you'll cook something\u2328for Bluebell next time.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136It's great you're cheering\u2328people on, but you should be\u2328entering if you can cook!
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136The Cooking Festival isn't\u2328about winning. It's about\u2328making something delicious.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I heard it didn't go so well\u2328today. Don't let it get you\u2328down.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f49\u2136I'm so excited for the\u2328\u1000 today.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136It's too bad you didn't\u2328enter today. I was looking\u2328forward to supporting you.\u232bI hope you enter next time!
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136It's too bad about today.\u2328Maybe you'll do better\u2328next time.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Why, \u232a.
