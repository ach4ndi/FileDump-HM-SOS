I'm looking kind of bland...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm. I've got to try a little
harder to look nice...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ugh. Terrible.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh dear. I look tired.
I need to relax...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder why I'm so tired recently...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm definitely not getting enough sleep.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yaaaawn. I'm sleepy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My eyes are bloodshot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've got dark circles underneath
my eyes...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why do my eyes look so
droopy...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My face looks dead.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I'm working a bit too hard.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm... I can see that I'm tired.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sigh. That's a tired face...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My face looks dull somehow.
I guess I'm overly tired...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder how old I look...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Could this lead to a parallel world?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've still got it!
I'm still young!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A p-pimple!{NextPage_1}I want to pop it!
Aggghh!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The road to beauty is a long one...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It can't be!
A zit on my face!?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come on! You can be just like Celia!{NextPage_1}......................{NextPage_1}No, I suppose that's impossible.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I gained weight after giving birth...{NextPage_1}No no! I'm still fine!{NextPage_1}.................I think.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You go girl!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My eyebrows are too bushy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess some cultures think that skin like
an eggshell is the most attractive...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Children watch their parents as they grow
up, so I've got to set a good example!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I should go on a diet...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can do it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The candle that burns twice as bright...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Rome wasn't built in a day, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh my goodness, me...
Uh-oh, I said that again.
I must be getting old.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm just entering the prime of womanhood.
Can't give up now...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why doesn't anyone seem to think that the
face of a working woman is beautiful...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's the face of a hard worker.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish I were a little prettier...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yep, I'm still OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Uh-oh. I'm getting crow's feet...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
“Mirror mirror, on the wall,
who's the fairest one of all?”
Did I really say that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think this mirror's a little curved...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wrinkles!
Disappear!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Takakura...
Sure does live long...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A gray hair......
Do I dye or keep plucking grey hairs out?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Am I aging gracefully?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think I'm younger than I look, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My skin isn't very young looking...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope I can stay like this forever.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yep. I'm still fine...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like my face quite a bit.
I guess.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
“Good job today.”
Do I have to say that to myself now?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
“Mirror, mirror, on the wall,
who's the fairest one of all?”
Oh never mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's show time!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish I were a Harvest Sprite.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I look kind of like a tiny little rose...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hate my bangs.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think my head's kind of big...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whew...
I'm tired.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My hair has quite a bit of
volume to it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hee hee♪
My hair is nice and long and straight♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish people would stop saying that
I “bought the farm...”{NextPage_0}
