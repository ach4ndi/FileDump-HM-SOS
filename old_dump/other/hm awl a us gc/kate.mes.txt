I said no!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you so much.
That was a really fun story.{32_7_208}
----------x----------
......
That's not really what I meant...
I just wanted to hear your story, {CharName_28}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's right.
You came to {Location_43_30_23} a long time ago,
{CharName_28}, and you've been here ever since.
Don't you want to go back to the {Location_43_31_23}?
I mean, what about romance or fashion?
You really don't miss that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No, I mean...{NextPage_49}
You've been digging for so long {CharName_28}, and
I realized you never did stuff like that.
I'm sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks, {CharName_28}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yeah, I learned a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, were you listening to us talk?
Yikes!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was just going to do it.{32_2_188}
----------x----------
Thanks. That was good.{32_2_188}
----------x----------
But carrots taste gross...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But why...?
I wanted to hear more of your story...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, do you have a song
appropriate for the occasion?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, er, 'scuse me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ahem--excuse me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But you don't have anything.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Bring something you can sell.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm just browsing...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just browsing, like I said.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How much for the {29_0}?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
{50_16_0_10}{34_1_89}Wow, what a deal!{32_1_244}
{50_16_0_0}Too bad I don't have any money on me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Too bad I don't have any money on me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}You're kidding! Oh, well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How much for the {29_0}?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
{50_16_0_10}Wow, what a deal!{34_1_90}{32_1_244}
Thanks!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll take it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}{34_1_91}You're kidding! Oh, well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Too bad I don't have any money on me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's enough for today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello! You tend the farm, right?
Are you working hard?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}I don't feel like talking...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}What do you want?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning!
Where are you going?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_10}...How are you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello.
Better hurry home now.
Your spouse is waiting for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing at this hour?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing at this hour?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi! Did you come to visit me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you have some business here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_10}Hey, that's my favorite!
Can I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_3}{34_1_89}Yay! Thanks!
You're awesome.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}You big meanie!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mmm, looks delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that you have there?
Can I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Yay! That's great!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}You expect me to eat that?
{34_1_88}No, thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_4}{34_1_88}But I hate that stuff...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}Eww, what's that?
{34_1_88}Get it out of here, will you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, how cute! We can play together once
you're a little bigger.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll hang out with you when you're older.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a sweet puppy!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish we had a puppy, too...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute kitty!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cats sure are carefree...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a chicken from your farm?{NextPage_1}I don't really like chickens.
----------x----------
Aw, how cute!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a precious little chick!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Look, I don't like chickens, okay?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't see many ducks around.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute duck!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love ducks--they're just so cute.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?
Some flower seed, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet Mom would like some vegetables.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom would want that for sure.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that milk from your farm?
You just can't beat fresh
milk, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Milk always makes my stomach rumble.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom could probably use some butter...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Butter, huh? Too bad I
can't eat it just by itself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}I hate eggs.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_5}{34_1_88}I hate them, I said!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What the heck is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can you eat it...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make this?
Hey, not bad!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I eat that?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
That looks yummy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What am I supposed to do with that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't need one of those.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You'll put someone's eye out with that!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that...a watering can?
It sure looks funny.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a weird watering can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is there any water in that thing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, I don't need to be watered!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?
What a weird machine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What am I supposed to do with that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A hair-cutting machine, eh?
Why don't you give Hugh a trim?
{50_16_0_3}{34_1_87}Ha, ha, ha!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Er, I don't think I need those...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a pretty stone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a pretty stone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_87}Hey...that looks neat.
Did you find that somewhere?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I kinda like stuff
like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Could that flower be...
A present? For me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
What a beautiful flower.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know what that is, it's a record.
My dad used to have some.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If I showed this to dad he'd be happy!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Er... what's that?
Are you supposed to cook with it?
Maybe Mom could use it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mmm, something smells good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}What a funny sound!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}What a strange drum...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A medal, eh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...It's just gold plated, I bet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now that's a different kind of necklace.
Wait...is it a present for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
...That's a beautiful necklace.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?
I can't tell what it's supposed to be...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What about it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, fireworks...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Tell me when you set them off, okay?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a present for someone?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't need that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_26}They call me a tomboy, but
despite how I look I can sometimes
be pretty girly, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hugh from next door is pretty
cute, but when we play together,
I can't help picking on him.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's not much to do around here,
but that's part of why I like it.
I like the town, too, though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom said the farmer in Mineral
Town is money-hungry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad said the farmer in Mineral
Town is super popular.
I wonder if that's true...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess {29_0}'s farm
is pretty amazing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0}'s animals
sure are happy.
Must be treating them right...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom said that all the farmer in Mineral
Town does is dig holes in the mountain.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad said the farmer in Mineral
Town is a master angler.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard {29_0} in Mineral Town
has walked a million steps...
Big deal, eh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the {29_0} Farm in Mineral
Town has been around for 50 years.
You'd better keep working hard, too!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad said the farmer in Mineral
Town is a fishing nut.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom said the farmer in Mineral
Town has bad taste.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer in Mineral
Town has 3 cottages!
Mom can't believe it, can you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad says there's a blacksmith in Mineral
Town who makes the coolest tools.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_10}That last thing you gave
me was really yummy.
I wouldn't say no to more!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_10}That last {29_0} was the best!
You can't beat that intense flavor.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The last thing you cooked was tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You must be working hard.
Mom says you're an
excellent farmer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're starting to make a
name for yourself.
Keep it up, all right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How's work coming?
You must be getting used to it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wouldn't like it if
I had to live here.
It's so boring.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know, I might be cut out
for this kind of life.{NextPage_49}
There's not much to do for fun, so
I'd end up doing a lot of thinking.
I think that might be kind of cool.{34_1_90}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What I do for fun? Around here?
Play with Hugh, I guess...
I'm actually doing him a favor.{NextPage_49}
{50_16_0_25}No, I don't pick on him!
I'm playing with him, all right?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lately, I can tease Hugh all I want,
but he doesn't cry anymore.
He's always mumbling under his breath.{NextPage_49}
He must be at that rebellious age, huh?
It's kinda cool.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
With so many strange people here, you
never get tired of hearing their stories.
I'm collecting interesting news like that.{NextPage_49}
I think I'll write a story based on
all the crazy stuff I've heard...
Right now I'm punching it up a bit...{34_1_90}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey,
am I really a tomboy?
{41_2_1}You bet.
No way.
----------x----------
{50_16_0_26}Yeah...
I think so, too.{NextPage_49}
{50_16_0_35}You know,
I should have been a boy.
Boys don't get called tomboys.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?
Or are you just saying that?{NextPage_49}
I don't think being a tomboy is
such a bad thing... After all,
there's nothing I can do about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey,
Want to hear the story I'm working on?
{41_3_1}Yes, please!
No way!
Whatever.
----------x----------
Really?
Okay, then...
Here goes...{NextPage_49}
No, never mind.
It's not done yet. I'll
tell you when I'm done.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_91}Oh, I see.
Never mind, then.{NextPage_49}
But if you ever do want to hear it,
just come right out and tell me.
Got it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm... well, it's not quite done yet...
Maybe later, okay?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want to be a novelist...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want to be a novelist...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't look too busy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom is so naggy.
I think I'll go out and play.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom's such a pain back home--
I think I'll go out somewhere.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm soooo bored!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's best to do your thinking outside.
Your imagination runs wild...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't there anything interesting going on?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This warm weather feels great.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom will just bug me if I go home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom will just bug me if I go home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I was at the beach the other
night, I looked up at the sky and
saw a pretty red star.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What should I do today...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sure is hot lately.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why is my mom always so
demanding?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why is my mom always so
demanding?{34_1_91}
I mean, I'm a grown-up now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really love this time of year.
You see such beautiful scenery
just by wandering around.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I looked at the top of the
waterfall the other night, I
saw a pretty blue star.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Brrrr.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Eek!{32_1_244}
{50_16_0_25}I wasn't doing anything.
Just... daydreaming. No, really!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This place calms me right down.
It's perfect for thinking about
all sorts of things.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's up?
Are you bored too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_35}Just leave me alone
and let me daydream!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_35}I'm thinking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm talking with Romana right now.
It'll come in handy when I write my book.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Romana has had a long life so
she knows tons of interesting things.{34_1_90}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}Don't bother me--I'm busy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm talking with Romana right now.
It'll come in handy when I write my book.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Romana's advice is really
quite useful.{34_1_90}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}Don't bother me--I'm busy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Right now I'm talking with Sebastian.
He knows lots of stuff that
will come in handy when I write my book.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sebastian is quite knowledgeable so
he helps me think about things a lot.{34_1_90}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}Don't bother me--I'm busy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was just listening to Gustafa's story.
It'll come in handy when I write my book.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Gustafa is a poet and a musician.
What a feast for the senses!{34_1_90}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_16_0_2}Don't bother me--I'm busy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks.
But I've changed my mind.
Maybe next time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hugh goes running even on days like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm better off making up
stories at home on days like this...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's nice to be in the forest,
even when it's raining.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just can't come up with
any good ideas at home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to bed now...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time for bed, so
you'd better head home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm about to go out, actually...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to go out now.
See you later...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See you...{NextPage_0}
