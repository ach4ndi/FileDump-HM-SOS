Oh {2d}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I talk to you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_25}What are you trying to sell?
You're a strange one...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't expect me to buy it, do you?
I thought you might give me something...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_25}If you were having trouble, I thought
I might buy something, but...
But there's nothing here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I see.
You're all sold out?
{50_3_0_10}{34_1_132}How wonderful! You're doing so well!❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that all you have?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's not bad, but I wouldn't buy it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Working hard I see.
How are sales?
{41_2_0}Pretty good.
Terrible.
----------x----------
Really?
{50_3_0_10}That's great!❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe if you smiled a bit
more, you'd have more sales...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, good luck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I wonder what the problem is.
I just don't feel well...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I don't understand it.
But I don't feel like talking right now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I'm sorry, could you leave me alone?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Maybe I'll take a little rest...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I wonder what the problem is.
I feel just terrible.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}I don't understand why myself, but
I feel just terrible.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}I think I need a little change
of pace.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I miss being single...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}Well!
If you can't even say something nice,
don't talk to me at all!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning, {2d}....
I guess I'm still not a morning person.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh... {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't stand mornings...
Yaaaawn...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't worry. I'll be back to my
normal self soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh {2d},
what's wrong?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d},
still have work left to do?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}Good job today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can't sleep?
{50_3_0_10}{34_1_132}Me neither.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's kind of nice to stay up sometimes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if it's bad for your skin...
I guess I should be heading for bed soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can't sleep?
{50_3_0_10}{34_1_132}Me neither.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_26}{34_1_133}It's kind of nice to stay up sometimes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if it's bad for your skin...
I guess I should be heading for bed soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How was your work?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you hungry?
Why don't you have a little snack?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You want to talk with me?
But I can't think of anything to say.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We should at least be able to
relax when we're at home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_25}We're terrible, aren't we?❤
Staying up so late.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll be going home soon.
I have things to do tomorrow.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll be going home soon.
I'm worried about {CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, do you have some business here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}Oooh! That looks great!❤
{41_3_0}Give it to her.
Don't give it.
Sell it to her.
----------x----------
Really?!
{50_3_0_10}{34_1_132}I love you, {2d}.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
{50_3_0_4}You're just showing it to me?
That's not nice!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
Sometimes you really surprise me,
{2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks very good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How nice.
{50_3_0_10}I'd like something like that...❤
{41_3_0}Give it to her.
Don't give it.
Sell it to her.
----------x----------
Really?
{50_3_0_10}{34_1_132}I'm so happy!
I love you, {2d}.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, give me one next time.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_5}What's wrong with you?
I don't want it that much!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}That doesn't look good at all.
Not appetizing at all...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Nope, that's not
appetizing at all!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't like that kind of thing...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}{34_1_132}Isn't that nice?
It's wonderful to have Daddy pick you up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Daddy spends all of his time
holding you and doesn't spend
any time with Mommy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh hello, {23}.
Are you hungry?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be sure you wash your hands afterward.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, it's {_22}...
Wasn't that the name?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be sure you wash your hands afterward.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_25}Oh, you startled me.
Don't sneak up on me like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Speaking of chickens, {CharName_1} was
chasing them the other day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope she'll lay some
delicious eggs for us, don't
you?❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you take good care of your
chickens, they'll lay golden eggs, right?
You'd better keep them happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be sure you wash your hands afterward.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How cute. It's too bad they're not this
cute when they're grown up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's hard to believe that little
yellow ball of fluff can turn
into a chicken...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be sure you wash your hands afterward.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
With all that quacking it sounds
like that duck is complaining
about something...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be sure you wash your hands afterward.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's hard not to like that face...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, a tiny little ducky.
Grow up big and strong, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}{34_1_132}Heehee❤
I laugh every time I think of how
these little guys walk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be sure you wash your hands afterward.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, a seed.
What kind is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know much about seeds.
Why don't you try planting it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, did you harvest that?
It looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If we're not selling it, let's eat it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder how I should cook that...
You know more about that than me.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that milk looks delicious.
Is it fresh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Doesn't the taste of milk change depending
on the kind of cow?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like my milk rich and sweet.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Try not to spill any.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese looks good.
Did you make it, {2d}?buttonü
----------x----------
If you're not going to sell that cheese,
let's eat it together!
Did you use good milk to make it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I could eat cheese every day.
Make plenty of it.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter looks good.
Did you make it, {2d}?buttonü
----------x----------
If you're not going to sell that butter,
let's eat it together!
Did you use good milk to make it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I could eat butter every day.
Make plenty of it.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a chicken egg?
Are we going to eat it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whether it turns into an omelet or a
baby chick, it's OK with me.
They're both yellow and fluffy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm?
Are you going to eat that fish?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not cleaning it, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Hey, that fish looked
at me just now!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that, grass?
Oh, a wild plant?
It doesn't look very wild though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wild plants are good for you, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that looks quite good.
I wonder if it tastes as good as it looks.
{41_2_0}Have some.
I'm sure it does.
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Oh, really?!
I'm glad I married you,
{2d}.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}What?
You're going to eat it by yourself? Hmph!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A hoe, right? Are you going to till some
soil? Wash your hands afterwards.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck tilling.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A hoe, right? Are you going to till some
soil? Wash your hands afterwards.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck tilling.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's a new hoe.
How nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck tilling.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A hoe, right? Are you going to till some
soil? Wash your hands afterwards.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck tilling.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
You want to buy a new hoe?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck tilling.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A sickle, right? Are you going to cut some
grass? Wash your hands afterwards.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck cutting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A sickle, right? Are you going to cut some
grass? Wash your hands afterwards.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck cutting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, a new sickle.
How nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck cutting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A sickle, right? Are you going to cut some
grass? Wash your hands afterwards.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck cutting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
You want to buy a new sickle?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck cutting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A watering can, right? Are you going to
water crops? Wash your hands afterwards.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your watering.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you got a new watering can?
How nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your watering.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A watering can, right? Are you going to
water crops? Wash your hands afterwards.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your watering.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
You want to buy a new watering can?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your watering.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's a new milker, isn't it?
{34_1_132}How nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope we get lots of nice milk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You use that to milk cows, right?
It looks like it would hurt...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope we get lots of nice milk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know how to use that, but be
gentle and wash your hands afterwards.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You want a new milker?
Yes, those poor cows...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope we get lots of nice milk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, clippers.
It's amazing how you can do that by hand.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck shearing the sheep!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are new, aren't they?
The sheep must be happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck shearing the sheep!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, clippers, right?
You use those to shear sheep?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck shearing the sheep!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You want some new clippers?
But aren't those easy to use?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck shearing the sheep!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you bought a new tool. How nice.
Remember to wash your hands afterwards.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
You must really like
that, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I'm sorry.
I don't know much about tools.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Ugh... That looks dirty.
Wash your hands when you're done with it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Oh!
What a pretty stone!❤
Where did you buy it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
You found it yourself?
I wonder if there are more of them?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That stone would make a nice decoration.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Couldn't you sell that stone?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Eek! What is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that expensive or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the wild plants around here
have some interesting qualities.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You picked that around here, didn't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}{34_1_132}Oh, a record.
How nice!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is it a good song?
I only like ones you can dance to.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Some kind of spice?
Did {CharName_25} give it to you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you use that, maybe you can cook
as good as {CharName_25}.
I'm looking forward to it!❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that the medal that
Wally had?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's pretty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an odd looking necklace.
I wonder if it would sell for a lot...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take good care of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What song is that for?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, can you play any
musical instruments?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Fireworks?
Wow.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}It's kind of scary.
It won't explode, will it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you plan to do with that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I left home at an early age, so I was
always seeking the approval of adults.
It was a tough time for me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looking at our child, I remembered
that.
I'm glad {CharName_1} was spared that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It must be easy to be an animal.
They never have to say things that
are different from what they really think.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My life now is much better than
when I was in the
{Location_43_31_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I came to {Location_43_30_23}
I thought it was in the middle of nowhere.
It was kind of scary.{NextPage_49}
But it wasn't like that at all...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everyone in {Location_43_30_23}
seems to be enjoying their own lives.{NextPage_49}
When I think about that, I feel
a little ashamed about how I
felt when I first came here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}The food you made was very good,
{2d}.{NextPage_49}
{34_1_132}You sure know what I like.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}I ate that food you gave me,
{2d}.
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}You're doing so well,
{2d}. You're a real farmer now.
That's what everybody says.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}You're doing so well, {2d}.{NextPage_49}
{Location_36_23_2}Farm's crops are all
turning out great.
That's what everybody says.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}You're such a good cook,
{2d}.❤
You should open a restaurant!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
At first, I was a little worried whether
you could really handle farming...
But you're working very hard, aren't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The crops are doing well.
I guess you like growing things,
don't you, {2d}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're better at cooking than
I am.
I've got to try harder...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Shouldn't you spend a little more time on
your milk and eggs?
I want to eat some good ones.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Shouldn't you work a little harder
on the crops?
Just a thought.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want to eat some good food!
Hey, why don't you
try studying cooking a little more?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I never thought I'd have a life like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I thought of it after I met
you, of course...❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_25}But even after coming here
I was very lonely, to tell the
truth.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_25}I had given up ever being able
get married..{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_25}I'm not unhappy with my life now,
but it can be a little boring sometimes...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_25}I'm not unhappy with my life.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_25}Living a well-ordered life
can be pretty difficult, can't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's gotten warmer, hasn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are bugs everywhere.
It's so gross.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish this weather would last forever.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whew, it sure is hot.
I don't feel like doing anything.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My makeup keeps smearing in this heat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be careful not to get a sunburn.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just don't have an appetite.
So why can't I lose weight?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's gotten a lot cooler, hasn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to listen to some music.
Maybe I'll go hear {CharName_27}
play his guitar.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Food is so tasty at this time of year...
Well, there goes my waistline!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} brought back all sorts of
things from the woods to show me.
Isn't that cute?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}Brrrr. It's cold.
I'm just not cut out for this kind
of weather...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}I can't even get the hot
water to work in the kitchen!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My feet and hands have been so cold
recently. I never had this problem
when I was younger...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}You've been working hard.❤
I thought maybe I'd study about crops too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_25}Is this good soil?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}I just want to be able to
help you out a little bit,
you know?❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}But I don't like getting my clothes
all dirty...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}{2d},
you certainly work hard.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}This field gets a lot of sun, doesn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}I hope we get some nice crops!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}I used to be worried about getting my
clothes dirty, but I'm used to it now.
{50_3_0_25}But I'm still a lady, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}You should use lightweight tools.
You don't want to hurt your back.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}You shouldn't push yourself too hard.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}The smell of the soil
makes me feel at peace.
Don't you feel that way, {2d}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}Good job today, {2d}.
Farm work can be fun, can't it?{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}We've got to keep everything
in good order, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}Leave the cleaning to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}I'm going to do my best to
be a good wife for you.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}It would be nice if {CharName_1} got
interested in your work, wouldn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}It feels good to work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think I understand why Takakura
wanted to run this farm
with your father.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you get tired, don't push yourself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}Oh {2d}, good job today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}Hello, {2d}.
Did you need something here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_0}Who, me?
{50_3_0_3}Ruby's teaching me how to cook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}Cooking is difficult, but
when I think of your face when I make
{50_3_0_3}something good, I get all excited.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}I hope I'll be able to
cook lots of foods like Ruby
someday...{NextPage_1}{50_3_0_9}.{32_3_32}.{32_3_32}.{32_3_32}This could take a while...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_0}Whenever I'm here I feel like
Ruby is my mother-in-law.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}Hello, {2d}.
What is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}Ruby is teaching me
how to cook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I'm still having trouble...
Maybe I'm not cut out to be a cook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}Ruby may not look it, but
she can be a hard taskmaster.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}It's hard going, but I'm
going to do my best to make good food
for you.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Cooking certainly is complicated...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Now when do you sprinkle
this spice again?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}You'd think my experience at the {Location_128_11_128}{_2f}ue Bar{17}
would come in handy, but... no luck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}{34_1_132}I feel so happy.❤
It's nice to have a family.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}You know, I just realized.
We have a real family now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}{2d}...
{34_1_132}Don't you wish we had had a little more
time to enjoy newlywed life?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_26}{CharName_1}'s in bed. We could
pretend we're still newlyweds...❤{34_1_132}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Good job today.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Today was another good day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}{CharName_1}is growing up
healthy. I'm so happy!❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_26}I can't wait for tomorrow!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}I hope tomorrow will be a good day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Whew...
{CharName_1} is at a difficult age now.
It can be a lot to handle.{NextPage_1}{50_3_0_1}But I can do anything if you're here.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}I'd like to go on a trip together.{NextPage_0}

{50_3_0_9}{CharName_1} is all grown up.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}{CharName_1} keeps saying
♪leave me alone!♪
It's so rude!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}{2d}...
Don't die before me...
Don't ever leave me all alone...{NextPage_49}
........
Hee, hee. Maybe I'm ahead of myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}We'll be together even when I'm a
tottering old lady...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Snore... Snore...{NextPage_0}

..........{2d}..........{NextPage_0}

...........{CharName_1}!.........
That child!... Honestly...

That's so sweet.
But I'm a little busy right now.
I'm sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe some other time, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}{CharName_1}{u_805a}
Have your Dad wash you
real well!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}You're all clean!❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_5}Oh just give the kid a bath!
Honestly!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Rain...
It's so depressing...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm scared of the lightning and thunder.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish this rain would stop...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Try not to get wet and catch
a cold, {2d}.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's raining...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whenever it rains, I feel like
crying...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's so humid my makeup washes off.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hate the rain.{NextPage_49}
But when it rains it makes
you work a little easier doesn't it?
So I guess I should be thankful.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is certainly good for the crops.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Try not to get wet and catch
a cold, {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When it rains, my body feels all
heavy for some reason...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you get wet, make sure you take a
hot bath. You're not getting any younger.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_31}Why don't I wear an apron?
{50_3_0_25}Well, I guess I should...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_0}Are you eating well, {2d}?
If you don't eat, you get tired.
Make sure you eat up!❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you think your taste in food will
change soon? Oily foods aren't good for
you, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I never seem to get any
better at cooking.
I guess it's just not for me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I guess I'll never outdo
Ruby. Not in this lifetime...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, welcome...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What? Why are you looking at me like that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}What's the big deal?
Can't a girl go back to work
after getting married?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}After all, you don't seem
to have much time for me, anyway...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_7}................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}{2d}, don't you have work to do?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Oh no!
What's going to happen to Suzy!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I'm talking about this soap opera.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}I just love how Suzy is
so eccentric...❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK, OK!
Get back to work, {2d}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's going to happen to poor Rachel!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}No!
What about Troy?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}That Troy is so bad...
I love him.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_0}{2d}...
Did you need something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}Sometimes I just want
to be alone...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_7}................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_7}{2d}...
Are you happy you married me?
For that matter, am I happy?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}Got to keep up with the latest gossip.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}It can be very informative...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}It's important to socialize.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}I'm going to make {CharName_1}
into a smart child if it makes me stupid!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}It's not that I don't like cleaning
but my back always seems to hurt
afterwards...{NextPage_49}
Why do you think that is?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}{CharName_1}'s future
depends on how much of an emphasis we put
on education now.{NextPage_49}
You'd better be careful how you act.
{CharName_1} is watching.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you see {CharName_1}'s bookshelf?
That child is reading all kinds of books.
Maybe you should take a look.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}There aren't many bad influences
here in {Location_128_15_128}{32_128_53}get-Me-Not Valley{17}, so it's
good for {CharName_1}.{NextPage_49}{u_805a}
If we were living in the {Location_128_12_128}{2c_128_55}y{17}
I'd probably be so worried I wouldn't
know what to do.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I wonder if {CharName_1}
is studying?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_5}That {CharName_1}!
Calling me a ♪nuisance♪!
I didn't raise my kid to talk like that!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_7}Do you think I've
made some mistakes in raising our child?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I understand that {CharName_1}'s
rebellion, but having your own child
say something like that is a shock...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_5}{CharName_1} keeps saying
♪Leave me alone!♪
How rude!{NextPage_49}
I didn't go through 38 hours of labor
to be talked to like that!
Right?!{NextPage_49}
Well, I guess you wouldn't
really understand that...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I like having so many rooms in our house.
But it does make cleaning a chore...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}Grant's girl Kate has certainly
been radiant lately.{u_805a}
I wonder if she's in love...❤{NextPage_1}It's good to be young.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}It's nice for children to grow up,
{50_3_0_9}But it does leave you a little lonely.{NextPage_49}
Hmmmm...
I think I want another baby...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}My body is so stiff these days.
I do wish that they would show some
aerobics programs on TV...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}Isn't Lumina good at the
piano?{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_0}I told her she should become
a hairdresser to make use of those
fingers of hers.{u_805a}{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_3}I know I'd go to her.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d},
how is your work going?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}I'm taking a little break.
{50_3_0_9}I feel old, always being around the house.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}{CharName_1} is fine.{u_805a}
I picked up anything that might be
dangerous in the house.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}Don't worry, I'll go back
home soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}I have to take plenty of breaks.
Raising a child can really be exhausting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}What's it like outside?
I hope it's not raining.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_12}Oh dear...
Did I remember to turn off the oven...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}I like it here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Apparently I'm not welcome
in {CharName_1}'s room right now.{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_7}I thought maybe I should get
out of the house.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_12}Recently I find I'm able
to relax more in places like this
than at home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}It's nice to have somewhere you
can go to relax.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Hmm?
There was something that I wanted to tell
you, but what was it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I've been so forgetful lately...
I hate getting older.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}Even {CharName_27} said that I
was getting senile.
{50_3_0_9}I have to be careful.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_1}Hmmm... Did I remember to
make the bed?{NextPage_0}
