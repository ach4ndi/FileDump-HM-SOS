Hmm... Hmm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's wrong?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um... The truth is that
my brother Mizuki is
missing!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh my!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've looked all over for him!
When I think of what might have
happened to him...!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Was he kidnapped?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No...{NextPage_49}
You see{u_0086}{2d} my father scolded him a
while ago{u_0086}{2d} and my brother swore
he'd run away from home...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh{u_0086}{2d} what'll I do?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All right{u_0086}{2d} I'll help you look
for him.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?!?!
Thank you!{NextPage_49}
My father even told him not to
come home{u_0086}{2d} so who knows where
he's gone to!{NextPage_49}
It's hard to know who's side
to be on...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's tough.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It sounds like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've already searched around here{u_0086}{2d}
so he may be have gone farther
away.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I understand.
Leave it to me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Waaah
Waaah
Waaah{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mizuki{u_0086}{2d} I presume?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know my name?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your brother asked me to look
for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you!!{NextPage_49}
I just left the village to get
back at my father and I couldn't
find my way back{32_1_44}.{32_1_44}.{32_1_44}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you think your father's
still mad?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yeah{u_0086}{2d} probably...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Waaah! If he's mad{u_0086}{2d}
I can't go home!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your brother's worried about you.
He looked pretty pale...{NextPage_49}
He's very upset.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know!{NextPage_49}
Maybe we could get
my father's favorite food
        to bring home{u_0086}{2d} too!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a good idea.
Let's do that!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So what does your father like?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know he likes
{12}Boiled Prawn{17}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Then I'd better catch a
{12}Prawn{17}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I caught one.
Let's cook it together.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's all black...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Was it boiled too long?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yay! It looks good!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your father should be happy now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Shall we go back home?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yeah.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mizuki!! Where have you been!
I was so worried!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry!!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank goodness you found him.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you{u_0086}{2d}
{_2e}!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please take this as a token
of my thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You got a {12}Amago Saute Recipe{17}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope this {12}Boiled Prawn{17}
helps smooth things over{u_0086}{2d} too...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where could he be?{NextPage_0}
