{35_2}Oh, hello there.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Oh yes.{NextPage_49}
In weather this nice, the
washing dries so quickly.
I love it.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Oh I don't know.{NextPage_49}
Now that Hugh has a playmate his own
age, he seems to come home every day
covered in mud.{NextPage_49}
We have a boy, so it's not so bad, but
you have a girl, after all..
We wouldn't want her to get hurt.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}I suppose you're right.
Hee hee hee.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}That's true.{NextPage_49}
There aren't any cars like in the city,
so if you can stand a little
inconvenience, it's a great environment.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Oh, your poor husband.
Hee hee hee.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Yes, he's a former marathon runner, so
he wants our son to follow in his
footsteps and be a pro athlete.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Oh, your poor husband.
Hee hee hee!{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Oh, have you finished making
dinner for tonight?{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Me neither.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Yes, maybe I'll
try that for us, too.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Well, that's very nice of you.
Hee hee hee!{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}I enjoyed it.
Well then, I'll talk to you later.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}My husband is training with Hugh
all the time, so we go through so many
shirts and towels...{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}No, he still depends on me for
so much. I wish he'd be a little
more mature.{NextPage_49}
Your {CharName_16} seems to be
doing quite well in that department.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Well, she's a girl, after all.
But it's cute, don't you think?
Hee hee hee!{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}That's right.
Hee hee hee!{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Thank you.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Yes.
I think he's more excited about
it than Hugh is.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
{35_2}Oh really?{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Lessons?
I don't really think that's necessary.{NextPage_49}
Children have unlimited potential if left
to their own devices. I don't think they
need to decide everything so early.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
{35_2}By the way, have you prepared
supper yet?{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Well then, as a thank you for the other
day, please take some of the food I made.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Not at all.
I just hope you like it.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Oh, is that right?
Hohoho.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Me too.
See you later.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Oh yes.{NextPage_49}
In weather this nice, the
washing dries so quickly.
I love it.{NextPage_49}
My husband is training with Hugh
all the time, so we go through so many{NextPage_49}
shirts and towels, it keeps
me washing constantly.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, are you all sold out today?
Oh well, then...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_2}If you don't have anything,
it can't be helped.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_2}...Hmm... Not much here, is there?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like the {29_0}, but
how much is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G,
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
{50_12_0_3}Really?!
That's not bad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, all right...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_9}Oh, I see...
Never mind, then...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like that {29_0},
but how much is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G,
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
I'm just wondering what I should
cook for dinner...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_0}.
How is the farm going? I'm always in the
market for good milk, if it's affordable.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_9}I don't feel like talking...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_9}I'm tired today...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, welcome.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_10}My goodness! That's one of my favorites!
Could I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_3}Oh, how nice of you! Hee Hee Hee!
Thank you very much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_9}{34_1_69}Oh... I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_10}I have a weakness for that kind of thing.
Could I... have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
That looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_25}I'm sorry.
I really don't like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't really like that kind of thing.
Sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_25}I'm sorry.
I'm not very fond of that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where on earth did you find that...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_10}What a cute child.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Should I tell {CharName_1}'s
fortune?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_35}Hmm... Ah!{32_1_244}
Hmm... Ummmhmmm...
I see...{NextPage_49}
{50_12_0_0}This child is intelligent and gentle.
Yes, I see a bright future.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, I see a bright future.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Should I tell {CharName_1}'s fortune?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_35}Hmm... Ah!{32_1_244}
Hmm... Ummmhmmm...
I see...{NextPage_49}
{50_12_0_0}I sense excellent athletic abilities.
This child will be healthy and active.
But maybe a little wild...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This child will definitely be healthy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Should I tell {CharName_1}'s fortune?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_35}Hmm... Ah!{32_1_244}
Hmm... Ummmhmmm...
I see...{NextPage_49}
{50_12_0_0}This child has boundless curiosity.
I sense a deep interest in many things.
But perhaps not much independence...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It'll be interesting to see how this
one grows up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, what a cute little doggie.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_35}Yes. {32_1_244}This dog
has quite a handsome face.
{50_12_0_0}His future is bright.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute doggie.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute kitty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_35}Hmmm...{32_1_244} This cat's ears are
nice and pointed and his nose is wet...
His future is bright.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute kitty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All chickens' faces look the same to
me, so I can't tell their fortunes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why would I tell a duck's fortune?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's some kind of seed, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you harvest it, give me some.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you grow that yourself?
Could I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_10}Really?!
Thank you.
I guess it never hurts to ask...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_25}{34_1_69}Oh, I see. Of course not.
You're going to sell it, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Then maybe I'll buy it later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Fresh fruits and vegetables are
good aren't they?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that milk from your farm?
Could I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Fresh milk sure is tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that cheese on your farm, right?
Could I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Cheese is good for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that butter on your farm, right?
Could I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
It's quite good on bread.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did one of your chickens lay that?
Could I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
My husband likes egg protein, you see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The kinds of wild plants that grow change
with the seasons.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, did you make that dish?
It looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're quite a good cook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Stop showing me that.
I'm getting hungry...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an odd hoe...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe's quite old, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty new hoe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_9}I don't know anything about hoes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks like an ordinary hoe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an odd looking sickle...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a strange sickle...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That sickle's quite new, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_9}I don't know anything about sickles.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks like an ordinary sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You use that watering can to water
your crops every day, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whatever it is, it's pretty old...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, those clippers bring back memories.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wally used those to cut Hugh's hair.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are nice clippers you've got.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you use them on your sheep...
I see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_9}I don't know much about tools.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is there something special about that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, what a pretty stone...
Could I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_3}Well! How nice of you!
Maybe I'll make it into a pendant...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_69}How mean...
{50_12_0_25}O-oh, I didn't say anything...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a pretty stone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty flower.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My family doesn't seem too
interested in music.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that some kind of seasoning?
It smells kind of odd.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of cooking do you use it in?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that... Is that the medal that my
husband used to have?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's one of my husband's mementos.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Fireworks?
Did those strange old men
make that...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet that would be pretty if you
set it off.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Working in the city can be fun, but when
I think about my husband and son, I'm
sure that this is the best place for us.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Fortunetelling is my hobby.
I'll tell your fortune anytime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope Hugh can become a
top athlete like my husband
Wally...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come to think of it, there's a man named
Rod in the city who is searching for some
medicine to help his sick wife.{NextPage_49}
I hear he's traveling all over the world
looking for it. Of course, I imagine his
wife would rather have him with her...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer from
Mineral Town is rather
wealthy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer from
Mineral Town is very popular.
I wonder if it's true...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you still a farmer if you spend
all of your time digging in mines?
Oh, I'm just talking about Mineral Town...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} from Mineral Town
is a master angler, I hear.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer from
Mineral Town is ignoring her farm and
just fishes all the time. Really...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer from
Mineral Town has three cottages.
I wonder if we can afford that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard there's a blacksmith in Mineral
Town who makes some amazing tools.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_10}That thing you gave me
was really delicious.
I'd like some more, if it's OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That thing you gave me
wasn't very tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me was a little
disappointing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_10}The {29_0} you gave me
was pretty good.
I'd love some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_10}The {29_0} you gave me
was very delicious.
I'm serious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That wonderful milk you gave me
certainly tasted delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me tasted...
How should I put this... um,
It wasn't as good as I'd hoped.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk you gave me
wasn't bad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_10}That milk you gave me
was incredibly good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me was
a little disappointing.
It was a little too strong for me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me was
kind of strong.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me tasted
good, but maybe it would be better
to make it into cheese...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_10}That milk you gave me
tasted just great.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_10}That milk you gave me
was tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_10}That milk you gave me
was incredibly good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_10}That milk you gave me
was rich and delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_10}That milk you gave me
was the best I've ever tasted.
You can't get milk like that in the city.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me tasted
a little disappointing.
Maybe there was too much fat in it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me tasted
fair.
But it was sort of strong...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me tasted
pretty good. But I think it would be
better made into butter...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_10}That milk you gave me
was really good.
But maybe it was a little too rich...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese was a little tart.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter was a little smelly.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_10}The {29_0} you gave me
was just the kind I like.
You made that youself?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_10}That dish you gave me
was delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're working hard, aren't you?
My husband was saying what a good
farmer you were.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're quite good at cooking.
That's what everyone says.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks like you're getting used to
farm life.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
People say that your cooking
is quite good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My husband is an athlete, so he
is very careful about his health.
It makes things difficult for me, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Working women have it hard,
you know.
Don't you think?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Shall I tell your fortune?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_35}Hmm... Ah!{32_1_244}
Hmm... Ummmhmmm...
I see...{NextPage_49}
{50_12_0_0}There's someone you like, isn't there?
I'm sure that person also likes you.
If you try hard, everything will be fine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_69}Oh, that's too bad.
I'm really quite good...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_35}Hmm... Ah!{32_1_244}
Hmm... Ummmhmmm...
I see...{NextPage_49}
{50_12_0_0}Are you thinking about changing
something in your life?
It's OK. There's still time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My predictions often come true.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Going out drinking is fun once in a while.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel good...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please come visit us again sometime.
I'll tell your fortune.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's pleasant enough to live here, but
the commute to the city can be tiring.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The woods are so nice and cool
at this time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hate commuting to the city at
this time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
At this time of year you can see some
pretty stars above the waterfall...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We were just talking about those two old
fireworks designers.{NextPage_49}
Kassey and Patrick are the best
fireworks designers in the world, they
say...{NextPage_49}
But one day when they were lighting a big
fireworks display, there was an accident
and they were blown all the way here.{NextPage_49}
I wonder how much of that is true.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We were just talking about Sebastian.
Now tell the truth. Do you think
that he wears a toupee?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_9}Listen...
It's about my Hugh...
I guess he's in a rebellious stage.{NextPage_49}
He doesn't talk much and he won't
listen to what we say.
Do you think it's just a stage?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Women like talking,
you know.
You know what I mean...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Women like talking,
you know.
You are the same, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_9}...How strange.
I've been throwing all kinds of things
in the spring here,{NextPage_49}
but the Harvest Goddess doesn't appear.
But I'm doing it just like the
legend said to...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_12_0_9}Maybe my offerings aren't nice enough...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cody's works of art seem like
they fit in with nature.
It's almost like they're alive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whenever I'm here, I feel like
energy is flowing through me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nina was a good person, wasn't she?
I like to stop by to pay my respects
from time to time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you visiting her grave, too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I'm so busy...
I'll have to pass for now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} from Mineral Town
has a dog that's very good at
catching dog disks, I hear.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} from Mineral Town
has a horse that won a race 10
times, I hear.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what a chicken festival is...
Oh, it's just that the farmer from Mineral
town has won it 10 times, they say.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear that {29_0} from Mineral
Town has won the horse festival 10
times...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what a sheep festival is...
It's just that {29_0} from Mineral
Town won ten times.
----------x----------
{CharName_0} was a good person...
I know I'll miss her...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, could you
play a song for us?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm headed to bed...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's my bedtime, so could you
be moving along?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Goodnight.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to be leaving soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to leave now, so if you
don't mind...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See you later.{NextPage_0}
