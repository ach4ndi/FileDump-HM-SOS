Hey you! Hey!
Listen to me
for a second! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Something really
great happened
to me today. {NextPage_49}
My boss wanted to
talk to me. {NextPage_49}
"I've got good news
for you," he said.{NextPage_49}
"We're opening up
a new store in the
city..." {NextPage_49}
"And we've decided
you should be the
manager!" {NextPage_49}
Finally, at long
last my big chance! {NextPage_49}
I thought it would
never come...{NextPage_49}
Now I'm one of the
elite of the
corporate world. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ha ha ha! {32_1_144}
I'll celebrate
great tonight! {32_3_232}

----------x----------
I need to be heading
home soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
 {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
 {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
 {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, there.
Make yourself at
home...!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_3}Oh, righ...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}Actually, I have a
present for you. {NextPage_49}
I mean it's kind
of old, but...{NextPage_49}
I've always just
been a corporate
employee, so I had {NextPage_1}to set an alarm
clock before I slept
every night. {NextPage_49}
However, I've
recently realized I
no longer need one. {NextPage_49}
I wonder if it's
because I'm
getting older. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So, I no longer
really need an
alarm clock...{NextPage_49}
I was hoping you
would accept it...{NextPage_49}
What do you think?
I was planning on
bringing it now. {NextPage_1}Would you mind if
I stopped by?
{41_2_0}Not at all.
Sorry.
----------x----------
{50_14_0_3}Oh, that's great.
Well, let's go. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_9}...
I see...{NextPage_49}
Well, I'll just
leave it here
and go home. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll leave it here.
The instructions are
pretty easy...{NextPage_49}
I guess you need to
get up early on
the farm too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll be going
then...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope you get good
use out of it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pardon me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All sold out for
today...? {NextPage_49}
Can't do anything
about it then...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I can't buy
anything today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {CharName_0}.
Are things going
well on the farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}That's my favorite
thing.
May I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_3}Why thank you
very much! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_9}{34_1_81}Oh...
I thought as much...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks so
delicious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}You've got something
really good there.
Is that...for me? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_3}Oh! Really?!
Well, I don't know
what to say. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's so nice...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_9}{34_1_81}I don't really have
the stomach for
stuff like that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_9}I'll pass...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not interested
in stuff like that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He's so cute.
Will you be friends
with Kate? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He's so cute. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Does he do any
tricks? Talk or
sing...? {NextPage_49}
I'm just kidding,
geeze. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cats are so wrapped
up in themselves...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That chicken is
clucking everyday...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're also raising
ducks on your farm?
Mmmm...Peking Duck...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that milk from
your farm? Could it
be for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
That milk tastes
better than the kind
you can buy back {NextPage_1}in the city.
It really is
very delicious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that cheese
on your farm, huh?
Is that for me? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
That's tasty looking
cheese. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made this butter
on your farm, huh?
Is it for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
That's tasty looking
butter. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}Can I have this? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
An egg's flavor
depends on how
chickens are raised.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I used to go fishing
a lot in my youth. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can find a lot
around here, but can
you eat that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't eat it
just like that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That must be new. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you going
to do with that
hoe? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's just a
plain hoe. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a new
sickle, isn't it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you going
to do with that
sickle? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's just a plain
old sickle. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You shouldn't just
wander around with
a sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a well used
sickle. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you want
me to say...?{NextPage_49}
It's a watering
can...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you going
to do with that
watering can...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going to
cut hair with that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are some big
clippers there. {NextPage_49}
If you were to use
them on someone's
head they'd get cut.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are mighty
big clippers. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Clippers?
{50_14_0_9}I don't really need
a haircut...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty
flower. {NextPage_49}
Are you going to
decorate your room
with it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pretty flower. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}That's a strange
drum... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Does that medal have
any meaning to you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is it a souvenir or
something...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of sheet
music is that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_9}Whoa! A bomb!? {32_1_244}
{50_14_0_0}Oh, it's a firework.
You surprised me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a big firework. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm an accountant
for a company in the
city, but I longed {NextPage_1}for peace and quiet.
That's why I came
out here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
After a hard days
work I need a
cold drink. {NextPage_1}That's when I take
a walk to
the {Location_43_33_23}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lately I've been
feeling exhausted...{NextPage_49}
Doesn't seem to
matter what I do...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer
over in Mineral Town
is really nice. {NextPage_49}
Maybe he'll be
the next mayor...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The animals on the
{29_0} farm seem
to be very happy.{NextPage_49}
Take good care
of them...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer over
in Mineral Town is
an amazing fisher. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer in Mineral
Town has been working
over 50 years...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer in
Mineral Town ignores
his work and just {NextPage_1}goes out and
fishes all day long.
I'm jealous...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the
farmer in Mineral
has 3 houses. {NextPage_49}
I'm jealous...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}I really liked what
you gave me before. {NextPage_49}
I hope you'll bring
it to me again. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_9}What you gave me
before...it was...
really...horrible. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you
gave me before was
very delicious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}The {29_0} I got
before was really
delicious. {NextPage_49}
I hope you can
bring me it again. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}The {29_0} I got
before was great. {NextPage_49}
It was just so
tasty. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk you gave me
before was
delicious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk from
before was really
delicious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The cheese you gave
me was kind of
smelly...{NextPage_49}
But it's kind of
addicting...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The cheese from
before was quite
delectable. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}The {29_0} I
got before was
tremendous. {NextPage_49}
You made it, didn't
you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}The dish I got
before was
delicious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}The fish you brought
me last time was
made into a {NextPage_49}
delicious dish by
Samantha. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}Samantha cooked the
wild plants you gave
me. It was very good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The food you
brought me before
was delicious...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You seem to be quite
a talented cook.{NextPage_49}
It's good to have
a talent. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Working in the field
isn't easy. {NextPage_49}
But you're doing
a great job. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You seem to be
getting used to
field work. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This room is
Samantha's taste.
Nice isn't it?{NextPage_49}
I'm fond of it
myself. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nothing calms the
soul than a nice
wood house. {NextPage_49}
It gives me a
nice warm feeling
inside...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think it I made
the right decision
in coming here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love listening
to music. {NextPage_49}
I had a stereo when
I was younger but
it was taken away {NextPage_1}because it was
too loud. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got a
stereo too, right? {NextPage_49}
I can hear it from
your farm easily.
It's nice...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you find a nice
record, please
show it to me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Kate has reached a
marriageable age. {NextPage_49}
I've got to find
someone for her
and fast! {NextPage_49}
Before it's too
late...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Samantha doesn't
seem to be too
worried about Kate. {NextPage_49}
I guess it's a
fathers job to be
worried. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Tell Kate if you
find someone nice
for her. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_7}The bosses are scary
so that's why
we work! {NextPage_49}
Don'tcha
think so too? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_7}{34_1_81}Pardon me...hic!
I'ma lil sloshed...
I'll be fine...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_7}{34_1_81}Hic...hic...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_7}Lately my daughter's
been avoiding me. {NextPage_49}
{34_1_82}I'm kind of
lonely...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_7}I think Kate and
Samantha have grown
sick of me. {NextPage_49}
What do you think?
{41_3_1}Not at all.
You got it.
I don't care.
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}Really...hic!
Thanks for saying
that. {NextPage_49}
Who are you again? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_7}{34_1_82}Oh so you think so
too? Fine. I don't
care anymore...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_7}{34_1_82}That's true.
I don't expect
anyone to care. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_82}{50_14_0_9}Sometimes I wonder
what life is all
about...sometimes...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I get so calm here.
Good drink and
good music...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}I feel a little
good...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's much hotter
in the city than
in the country. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't want to go
to the city in the
Summer. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I watch the
colors change like
this, I think it was{NextPage_1}a good thing to
come here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not too good
in the Winter so
I try not to go out. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The snow doesn't
fall too bad here so
we're able to walk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_82}I'm tired today. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I relax like
this, I think about
my life. {NextPage_49}
Is this a good
life...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm happy.
I get to live with
Kate and Samantha. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_81}I wonder...
Could you leave me
alone for a while? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_2}{34_1_81}I...hic...think
I drank too
...hic...much...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_2}{34_1_81}Uwa...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_2}{34_1_81}I'm okay... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_5}Who's scared of
Samantha, huh?
Not me!{NextPage_49}
{50_14_0_7}{34_1_81}Sorry...don't tell
her about that...{NextPage_1}That was a secret.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_5}I'm not scared of
Samantha...
Not scared...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_7}{34_1_82}Sorry...
I'm a little
sloshed...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}I'm feeling pretty
good. {NextPage_49}
Would you like to
play a game with me? {NextPage_49}
We'll have a milk
drinking race. {NextPage_49}
If I win...
Well, we'll talk
about that later. {NextPage_49}
What do you say?
{41_2_1}You're on!
No thanks.
----------x----------
Okay, let's do it.
Go to the kitchen.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...
Let's do it
next time, okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I may not look it,
but I'm a milk
drinking machine. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So shall we race?
{41_2_1}Let's do it.
I don't think so.
----------x----------
Oh, thanks...
But...never mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, you've
really helped me
out time and again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, let's
have a song for our
{CharName_0}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to bed
now so...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time for me
to be in bed. {NextPage_49}
If you'd please
head on home? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time for me to
be on my way...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've really got to
be going so...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good bye then...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The agony of defeat! {32_2_188}
I won't lose next
time! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looks like fortune
smiles on me today. {32_2_188}{NextPage_49}
Better luck next
time. {NextPage_0}
