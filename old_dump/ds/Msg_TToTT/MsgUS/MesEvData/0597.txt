\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I love spring...\u2328It's so relaxing somehow...
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I always have a lot of\u2328flowers in stock in spring.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136You should come down to the\u2328shop some time.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136The cherry trees will be in\u2328full bloom soon.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136I always look forward to\u2328this time of year.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136All the flowers in the\u2328mountains will be blooming\u2328soon.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136I'm looking forward to\u2328seeing them on my walks.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136It's so hot all the time.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136You should make sure you\u2328don't get dehydrated.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136It's so hot all the time...\u232bIt's hard to stock flowers\u2328in the summer.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136It's so hot all the time...\u232bIt's hard to stock flowers\u2328in the summer.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136It's another hot one.\u232bIt's a good day to go to\u2328the mountain to catch a\u2328cool breeze.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Fall's really here now.\u232bThe colors of the leaves are\u2328so beautiful.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136The temperature can change\u2328a lot in the mornings and\u2328evenings in fall.\u232bYou have to dress in layers.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136It's a lot nicer out now.\u2328\u232bWork should get a little\u2328easier now too...
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136The fall flowers are so\u2328beautiful.\u232bDon't the flower beds around\u2328the village look beautiful?
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136It's gotten a lot colder.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136It's actually really cold\u2328at the shop during winter.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136It's been so cold lately.\u232bMake sure to dress warm or\u2328you'll catch a cold.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136It's even colder today.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I can't wait for spring.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136It's freezing today.\u232bMake sure to dress warm or\u2328you'll catch a cold.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Nice weather always puts me\u2328in a good mood.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136It's so nice to go for\u2328a walk on days like this.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136The weather's been so\u2328unpredictable lately.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136It's really a nuisance when\u2328you work outside.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Nice days are so refreshing.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136I hate when it rains because\u2328the ground gets so muddy.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136When it's nice out, I get to\u2328go all over to get flowers\u2328to stock my shop.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136I really like being able to\u2328have a job that takes me to\u2328other places.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136It's been raining all day...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136I hate going out in\u2328the rain.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136It gets so muddy on rainy\u2328days... Be careful not to\u2328slip.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136The weather's been so\u2328unpredictable lately...\u232bYou should probably check\u2328the weather report every\u2328day.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136The weather has been so\u2328unpredictable lately...\u232bYou should probably check\u2328the weather report every\u2328day.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I've always loved the way\u2328this place looks in the\u2328snow.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136Don't you think it's pretty?\u2328
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I saw someone slip here\u2328the last time it snowed.\u2328\u232bYou should walk carefully\u2328when it's snowy out.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Snow, huh?\u2328This reminds me of when we\u2328were younger...\u232bAsh and Georgia joined\u2328forces for this huge \u2328snowball fight...
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136When I was a kid...\u232bI used to build snowmen\u2328a lot when it snowed.\u2328It was so much fun.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136I always feel uncomfortable\u2328here for some reason...
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136Sorry...\u232bI don't really like it here.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136I had a lot of fun today.\u232bI hope we can talk again\u2328sometime soon...
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Well, I'll see you later.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136I'm going to head home now.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136See you...

\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Every summer, the village\u2328has a Stargazing Festival.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136The night sky is so pretty\u2328in summer.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I've made so many\u2328discoveries traveling\u2328around the country.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136\u232a, did you figure out\u2328about the message board yet?\u232bIf you successfully fulfill\u2328a request, you get a\u2328reward...
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Everyone in the village\u2328loves flowers.\u232bCheryl comes to buy flower\u2328seeds from me a lot.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136When I'm working at the\u2328store, a lot of people pass\u2328by.\u232bI see Cheryl going into the\u2328cafÂ† on errands a lot...\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136She's such a good girl to\u2328work so hard like that.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Every summer, the village\u2328has a Stargazing Festival.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136You have such an amazing\u2328view of all the stars from\u2328the top of the mountain.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136A little while ago, I went\u2328to a town with a lot of\u2328windmills.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136It was a really nice town\u2328with a refreshing breeze.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136The mayor is in charge of\u2328the message board.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136People use it all the time,\u2328so it's really helpful.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Everyone in the village\u2328loves flowers.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136Rose's flowers are always\u2328really beautiful. She takes\u2328such good care of them.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136When I'm working at the\u2328store, a lot of people pass\u2328by.\u232bSpeaking of which...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136I see Eileen running around\u2328looking busy a lot.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136Sometime she trips and falls\u2328down, so I always get kind\u2328of anxious watching her.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Every summer, the village\u2328has a Stargazing Festival.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136I love looking at the stars.\u2328I could spend hours looking\u2328at them and not get bored.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136There are a lot of unique\u2328flowers around the country.\u2328\u232bThey also sell a lot of\u2328products made with flowers.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136The other day, Howard put\u2328a request on the message\u2328board for me.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136I don't know why he didn't\u2328just tell me at the house.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I heard there's a botanist\u2328in Konohana.\u232bShe mostly studies the\u2328local plants.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136I'd love to hear what she's\u2328learned about them.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136When I'm working at the\u2328store, a lot of people pass\u2328by.\u232bSpeaking of which...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136I see you running around\u2328looking busy all the time.\u232bBe careful you don't work\u2328too hard.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Do you like to watch the\u2328stars, \u232a?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136I've always loved the stars\u2328ever since I was little.\u232bI've read a lot of books on\u2328astronomy.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136When I went to another part\u2328of the countryside, I had\u2328this delicious herb tea.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I tried making it when I\u2328got back here, but...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136It didn't taste the same.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136If I ever get to go there\u2328again, I want to have that\u2328tea.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136The other day, Howard put\u2328a request on the message\u2328board for me.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136I don't know why he didn't\u2328just tell me at the house.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136Rose gave me some flowers\u2328the other day.\u232bIt's so nice to get flowers\u2328from someone...\u232bEven though I'm around\u2328flowers all day, ones I get\u2328as gifts are special.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136When I'm working at the\u2328store, a lot of people pass\u2328by.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136The other day, Rose brought\u2328me some cake...\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136I don't like sweet things,\u2328though, so I wasn't really\u2328sure what to do with it...
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136I love the stars...\u232bWe're seeing the light that\u2328they gave off millions of\u2328years ago...\u232bDon't you think there's\u2328something almost mystical\u2328about that?
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I've known Ash since we were\u2328kids.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136He's never changed much...\u2328
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I'm living at Howard's\u2328house.\u232bHe's such a nice guy.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136People in the village are\u2328always coming to buy the\u2328flowers I stock.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136I'm so glad they're all so\u2328interested in flowers.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136The women in this village\u2328are really hardy.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136You'll see what I mean when\u2328you talk to them.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136Sorry.\u232bI'm much better at listening\u2328than I am at talking.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136Ash has always been rowdy.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136I wouldn't mind it if he\u2328calmed down a little...
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I'm living at Howard's\u2328house.\u232bHoward runs the cafÂ† with\u2328his daughter Laney.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136People in the village are\u2328always coming to buy the\u2328flowers I stock.\u232bThe other day, Cheryl came\u2328in to buy some flowers for a\u2328present.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136She was going to give them\u2328to Jessica and Ash to thank\u2328them for everything they do.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136The women in this village\u2328are really tough.\u232bJessica is raising her\u2328children and running a farm\u2328all by herself.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136She's such a strong person.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136Sorry.\u2328I've never been much of a\u2328talker.\u232bI hope that doesn't bother\u2328you.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Ash and I used to play\u2328in the mountains a lot.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136He'd just run around without\u2328a plan. He got lost all the\u2328time.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Howard is amazing.\u2328\u232bOnce when Laney forgot her\u2328lunch on a field trip...\u232b..he climbed up the mountain\u2328to bring it to her.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136The power of a parent's love\u2328is really incredible.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136People in the village are\u2328always coming to buy the\u2328flowers I stock.\u232bRose came in to buy some\u2328flower seeds the other day.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136It's her dream to fill the\u2328village with flowers.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136The women in this village\u2328are really tough.\u232bEileen looks so petite, but\u2328she's able to carry all that\u2328heavy lumber.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136Where does she get all\u2328that strength?
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136Sorry.\u2328I've never been a really\u2328big talker.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136But I'd love to hear what\u2328you have to say, \u232a.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Ash and I used to play in\u2328the mountains all the time.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136He always liked it when\u2328I gave him the bugs I found\u2328on the plants I examined.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136He becomes a totally\u2328different person when\u2328he's angry.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136You should try not to\u2328make him mad...
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136People in the village are\u2328always coming to buy the\u2328flowers I stock.\u232bSpeaking of which,\u2328the other day...\u232bGrady came in to buy Georgia\u2328some flowers as a present.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136They're such a close family.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136The women in this village\u2328are really tough.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136Cheryl knows just how to\u2328deal with Ash, even though\u2328she's still a kid.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136She'll be quite a woman\u2328when she grows up.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136...\u232bIt's amazing, \u232a.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136I'm usually not good at\u2328making conversation...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136But somehow when I'm with\u2328you, the words just come\u2328pouring out of me...
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136When I come back from other\u2328villages, Ash always comes\u2328to see me.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136To be honest, it can be\u2328annoying at times...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136But it does make me feel\u2328like I'm really home.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Howard is like a father\u2328to me.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136He can be a little strange,\u2328but I have so much respect\u2328for him...
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136People in the village are\u2328always coming to buy the\u2328flowers I stock.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136The other day the mayor\u2328came in to buy a bouquet.\u232bHe had a fight with Rose,\u2328and he wanted to give it to\u2328her when he apologized.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136The women in this village\u2328are really tough.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136You should see Rose when she\u2328gets angry at the mayor.\u2328It's scary!
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136...\u232bYou're amazing.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136You make friends so easily.\u2328\u232bYou have some sort of\u2328charisma that draws people.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136When I travel around the\u2328country for work, I meet\u2328all sorts of people.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136It's always interesting\u2328to hear what they have to\u2328say.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136People in this village\u2328just love to talk!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136Everyone says nice things\u2328about you, \u232a.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136There's a lot of animals\u2328in this village.\u232bWe really do share it with\u2328the animals. 
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136People in this village are\u2328really nosy.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136\u232a...\u232bYou're...\u270b\u2328\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136so interesting.\u232bI have so much fun talking\u2328to you.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136When I go all around the\u2328countryside for work, I meet\u2328all sorts of people.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136The other day, I saw a\u2328tough-looking craftsman\u2328dressed like a panda.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136People in this village\u2328love to talk.\u232bI'm not a big talker...\u2328But you seem like you could\u2328talk to anyone.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136The land this village is\u2328built on is perfect for\u2328raising animals.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136I think having animals\u2328around makes life wonderful.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136The other day, Jessica came\u2328by to bring me some food.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136Jessica's a really sweet\u2328person. She's always\u2328thinking about other people.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136\u232a...\u232bYou're...\u270b\u2328\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136really nice.\u232bTalking to you makes me feel\u2328so relaxed.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136When I go all around the\u2328countryside for work, I meet\u2328all sorts of people.\u232bThis one time, I even\u2328saw a prince!
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136You're not throwing things\u2328in the river, are you?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136Polluting the river makes\u2328everyone angry.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136The land this village is\u2328built on is perfect for\u2328raising animals.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136Do you like animals?\u2328
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136The other day, I brought the\u2328shelves from the store\u2328to Eileen's shop for repair.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136She not only repaired them,\u2328she covered them in gold\u2328leaf for some reason.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136They were so gaudy. I had\u2328to scrape it all off.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136\u232a...\u232bYou're such...\u270b\u2328\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4d\u2136a nice person.\u232bI really respect the way you\u2328think about other people.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136When I go all around the\u2328countryside for work, I meet\u2328all sorts of people.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136Last time I went to this\u2328village where they were\u2328holding a grand bazaar.\u232bIt was a great place.\u2328There was so much going on!
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136\u232a,\u2328have you given people in the\u2328village any presents yet?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136Everyone has their likes and\u2328dislikes, but I think they'd\u2328all love a present.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Do you have any pets?\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4d\u2136I think cats...\u232b...are really cute...
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136When I go to stock my shop,\u2328Howard makes me a ton of\u2328food to take with me.\u232bHe always packs enough food\u2328for 4 or 5 days, so I never\u2328worry about going hungry.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136I'm always shocked at the\u2328amount of food he packs, but\u2328it's a huge help to me.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136\u232a...\u232bUh...\u270b\u2328I think...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4d\u2136You're a great person.\u232bIt's easy to see just why\u2328everyone loves you.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136The other day, I ran into a\u2328merchant friend of mine who\u2328collects ore and minerals.\u232bHe has a booth at his\u2328town's bazaar now.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136He seems to be doing well.\u2328\u2328
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Have you been talking to\u2328people in the village?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136If you get so wrapped up in\u2328work you forget to talk to\u2328people, they'll be sad.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136And...I'd be sad too...\u2328
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136The other day, I went to\u2328Grady's to deliver\u2328a package...\u232bThat cat that's always by\u2328the counter...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4d\u2136He's...\u232bHe's really cute....
