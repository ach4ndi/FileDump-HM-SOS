{CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Still wandering
around as usual, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How about a drink
next time? {NextPage_49}
Why don't we get
together at
Takakura's place?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oops, I forgot. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't think
I'll be able to
go drinking today. {NextPage_49}
Don't you think
{CharName_2} is becoming
like {CharName_29}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See you later. {NextPage_49}
I'll be over by
his house at 9.
That's a promise. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looks like the
gangs getting
together. {NextPage_49}
Are you done with
work for the day?
{41_2_0}All done.
Not yet.
----------x----------
Alright, time for
a cold one! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Women are creatures
of change. {NextPage_49}
No longer do they
just bow to our
every whim. {NextPage_49}
{CharName_0}, what
about your wife?
{41_2_0}Good as ever.
Totally changed.
----------x----------
Aha.
So I was right! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's always better
when it's just the
guys... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's as I said.
Time changes women. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, we're all
here.. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See you around... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess we'll go
ahead and start
it first. {NextPage_49}
Go get your work
done quickly.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Here's to another
day of work.
Let's drink up! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you've got time
on your hands, let's
get together with{NextPage_1}Takakura and have
some drinks.{NextPage_49}
Usually right about
9 I can go over to
his place.{NextPage_49}
Well, see you
around. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are we talking
about...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah...
What were we talking
about? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {CharName_0}. {32_1_244}
Pay up when you're
done eating. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Geeez...
Just do what you
want... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is not a place
for a newcomer like
you to come.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmph, a dog should
run with his tail
between his legs. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_2}{CharName_2}, don't
you have to go
shopping? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_5}Hmph... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You came here just
to meet women,
didn't you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That guy stopped her.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}It has everything to
do with me!{NextPage_49}
I was the only one
who didn't know
about {CharName_2}'s {NextPage_1}situation with the
arranged marriage. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_2}, how
do you feel? {NextPage_49}
Do you want to date
that guy? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_5}Then just get outta
here! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Not there either...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_7}Why? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}{CharName_2}... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}{CharName_2}, come
back! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, wait a sec!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Although you were
with {CharName_2},
you went ahead and {NextPage_1}proposed to another
girl?! {NextPage_49}
What is the meaning
of this! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_2}Don't try and make
any excuses! {NextPage_49}
I won't forgive
you for this!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_5}Do whatever you
want... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Fine... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Celia! You have run
some errands, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey open up!!
Open up, {CharName_0}!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Owwwww!! {32_3_32}
What the heck
are you doing...? {NextPage_49}
Come on, man.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yo, {CharName_0}. {NextPage_49}
We finished work
early and are going
for a drink. {NextPage_49}
We want to join us?
{41_2_0}Sure.
I still have work.
----------x----------
Guess we'll be
starting without
you then. {NextPage_49}
Hurry and finish
your work, so you
can join us. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Farewell...
You were a good guy.
Wait for me there. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, sing
something in honor
of him will ya? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So do you wanna
buy something today?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
No?
Okay, come by
anytime. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay, well pick
what you want. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{13}{29_0}{17}?{NextPage_49}
You have {2a_0_3}
already, how many
do you want? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, you're rucksack
is already full. {NextPage_49}
Organize it a little
and then come back. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, you don't have
enough money. {NextPage_49}
Come back when you
have the right
amount. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2a_0_2} unit(s) of
{13}{29_0}{17}
will cost {2a_1_7}G. {NextPage_49}
Is that okay? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
Thank you.
Come back if you
need anything else. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nothing?
Okay, see you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, my man... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, can I come
in for a second? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_144}{50_30_0_4}There's nothing
here... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh well, guess I'll
have to come back
when you have stuff. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}Don't mind me.
I'm just taking
a look around. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't there anything
else...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nope, nothing else.
Later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Who's there?
Oh, the new guy. {NextPage_49}
I help out here
in the fields... {NextPage_49}
I used to work for a
big company in the
city, but I had to {NextPage_1}quit because I got
sick.{NextPage_49}
So, I came out here
where the air is
fresh. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_7}......... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_7}...... Just leave me
alone... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}Do you want
something...!? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_5}......
You want something
from me!? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yo......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yo......
What are you doing
out tonight? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yo...... {NextPage_49}
What did you come
here for so late
at night? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yo......
How's it going?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yo...... {NextPage_49}
What did you come
here for so late
at night? {NextPage_49}
Huh, I guess you can
ask me the same
question. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that for me...?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Oh, cool.
Ah...thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}Oh, so it's not
for me, huh? Hmph.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}You've got something
really good there.
For me, right?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
That's looks really
great... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}What the heck is
that!? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_5}Don't even show it
to me...! {NextPage_49}
I don't like stuff
like that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}......
Oh, that's...
Celia's... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......
Sorry I'm not really
into kids much...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_3}I guess he's...uh...
kinda cute...
maybe...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}I really not very
good with kids,
but...cute...{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}Animals, huh?
I don't really like
animals much. {NextPage_49}
I'm much better
with crops. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}I think he's kinda
cute..., but I'm
really not good...{NextPage_1}with animals...
Mmm... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}That's a good seed,
wouldn't you agree?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do your best to grow
some good crops. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_3}......
That's a crop that
you grew right? {NextPage_49}
You did a good job
with them. {NextPage_49}
Can I have a taste?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
You did a pretty
good job... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}You got that from
your farm...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks very fresh.
Fresh is always
better... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}Ah...
You got that from
around here, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......
Is it a good one?
I don't know. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}Ah...
Did you cook this? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}...Well,
that looks really
delicious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}That looks really
heavy... Weird...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}Where did you get
such an unusual
hoe like that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}Ah...
That hoe looks like
it's been well used.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}I can't believe you
used that hoe until
now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}That's still a very
new hoe... {NextPage_49}
You need to use it
more... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}That hoe hasn't even
begun to really live
yet... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}It looks like it's
been used a little. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The more you use a
hoe, the better it
fits your hand... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}...Well,
that's a really well
used looking hoe... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}It looks very easy
to use now, doesn't
it...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}That sickle looks
hard to use... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}That's a strange
sickle. {NextPage_49}
Where did you get it
from? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}That sickle looks
like it's really
sharp... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}It may look weird,
but I bet it cuts
like crazy... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}It's still a very
new looking sickle. {NextPage_49}
You've got to use
it more... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}That sickle needs
to be used much
more... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}Seems like you've
used that sickle a
decent amount. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The more you use a
sickle, the easier
it becomes for you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}That sickle has been
used a long time... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}That sickle is
probably great to
use in the field... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}Don't you think
that watering can's
shape is strange? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Ah...
I still think that's
strange... Weird...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}You haven't really
used that watering
can much have you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}That's a brand new
watering can...{NextPage_49}
Do you not like
working in the
fields? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}That watering can
has been used a
little... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Are you going to
water our fields
too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}That's an old
watering can... {NextPage_49}
Although, it does
look easy to use
now... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}That watering can
has been used a
long time... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}Ah...
What is that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}It's a machine to
milk cows...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}Those are......
shears... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}You can't use that
in the fields... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's basic
knowledge really,
but if you use a {NextPage_1}tool effectively
your results will
also increase. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}Ah...
It's...a plant. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's a major
difference between
plants that grow {NextPage_1}in the wild and
those you grow
yourself. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Oh, a record.
That's nice.
Is that for me?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Cool...
Records are nice.{NextPage_49}
Of course that
depends on the
music on them. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}What is that? {NextPage_49}
Does it have
anything to do
with me? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}That's unusual...
I'm not interested
in it, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}Is that for me?
...No? I guess I'm
mistaken... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Who are you going
to give that to? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}I'm Vesta's younger
brother, and I help
out on the farm... {NextPage_49}
Didn't I tell
you that already? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_144}{50_30_0_9}I help out in the
fields now, but I
used to be one {NextPage_1}of the corporate
elite in the city. {NextPage_49}
If I wasn't sick,
I could be president
or CEO by now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}I can't really
charm anyone... {NextPage_49}
Well, maybe someone
like Celia... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}The food I got
before tasted
wonderful. {NextPage_49}
Not bad at all... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}To be honest,
I hated the food
I got last time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}The {29_0} I
got last time tasted
very blah... {NextPage_49}
You've still got
a ways to go before
being a farmer... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}The {29_0} I
got last time tasted
delicious. {NextPage_49}
You've gotten a
little better... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}The {29_0} I
got last time tasted
the...best... {NextPage_49}
I was surprised at
just how good it
tasted... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}The {29_0} I
got last time was
actually my favorite.{NextPage_49}
It was absolutely
delicious... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}The milk I got last
time tasted ah...
alright.{NextPage_49}
You've still got
a ways to go before
being a farmer... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk I got last
time tasted
so-so. {NextPage_49}
You've gotten a
little better. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}The milk I got
last time tasted
delicious. {NextPage_49}
You've gotten SO
much better... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}I don't know what
milk that was,
but it was great. {NextPage_49}
Thank you so much
for giving it to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}I don't know what
milk that was,
but it had a very {NextPage_1}strong smell to
it on the inside. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}I don't know what
milk that was, but
pretty good. {NextPage_49}
It had a very
weak smell to
it on the inside. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}I don't know
what kind of cheese
I had last time but,{NextPage_1}it tasted really
delicious to me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made the cheese
I had last time
right...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}I don't know
what kind of butter
I had last time but,{NextPage_1}it tasted really
delicious to me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made the butter
I had before...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The dish I received
last time was...{50_30_0_3}
It was really good!
----------x----------
The fish you got me
last time... {50_30_0_3}{NextPage_49}
That was some good
fish. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}The wild grasses
I got before were
so good... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The food I got last
time was really...{50_30_0_3}{NextPage_49}
Well, it was really
good to eat... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}You're trying so
hard to make things
work everyday... {NextPage_49}
I'd say that you've
become a great farmer
at this point. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}You've really put
a lot of energy into
your fields... {NextPage_49}
You put me to
shame. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}I heard that you're
a good cook. {NextPage_49}
Planning on being
the next Iron Cook? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It really looks like
you're working hard.{NextPage_49}
Your farm could
exist securely at
this point. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you putting in
the effort needed
for the fields? {NextPage_49}
It's easier said
than done. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you putting in
your energies into
cooking...? {NextPage_49}
Is that better
than the fields? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Looks like you're
starting to get the
hang of farm work. {NextPage_49}
{34_1_145}It's just beginning
for you... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Are you starting to
get the hang of
working the fields? {NextPage_49}
{34_1_145}It's just beginning
for you... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Starting to get the
hang of coking? {NextPage_49}
It's just beginning
for you... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, do you like
Celia?
{41_3_1}She's interesting.
Not really.
Who cares?
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}I see...
You better take
good care of her. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}Is there someone
else you like? {NextPage_49}
Well, just do
what you want... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}......
I guess your right.
I was just curious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't think I was
meant for work out
in the fields. {NextPage_49}
There must be a good
job for me somewhere
out there. {NextPage_49}
Still, without me,
who would tend
the fields...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't think I was
meant for work out
in the fields. {NextPage_49}
Still, I do like
working with crops. {NextPage_49}
Especially when it
comes to breeding of
different crops. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Breeding of crops is
when you splice DNA
from one crop into {NextPage_1}another crop to
create something
entirely new. {NextPage_49}
If you mix a tomato
with a watermelon,
you get {26_0_5}. {NextPage_49}
Or if you mix a
melon with a
strawberry... {NextPage_49}
Then you'll get
a crop called the
{26_0_10}. {NextPage_49}
You could even mix
the {26_0_5} with
the {26_0_10} {NextPage_1}and get a brand new
crop again. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now that I think
about it, this life
isn't so bad. {NextPage_49}
It's not always the
most stimulating
lifestyle here,{NextPage_1}but still it's not
a bad one either. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think Daryl might
be doing some kind
of research on {NextPage_1}selective breeding
of crops and such. {NextPage_49}
I wonder what he
may have created... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If I could create
a good crop, I might
be useful to Vesta. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Forget-Me-Not Valley
really suits me
the best. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I relax so much when
I'm here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love that I'll
never be chased
out of here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you want
something from
me? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}I hope you didn't
come just to kill
time with me... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This place is so
comfortable... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't you think
this place is
comfortable? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't you think
this is a nice
season? {NextPage_49}
It's getting warm
so quickly... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}This is a nice time
of year... {NextPage_49}
Especially for my
health...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My body can't take
it when it's too
hot or too cold. {NextPage_49}
{50_30_0_3}This is really the
best time of year
for me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Before I came here
I was always so
busy... {NextPage_49}
{50_30_0_3}Now, this place
is all I need. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_144}{50_30_0_9}Everyday it's a
little hot in
the Summer. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_144}{50_30_0_9}Everyday is hot...
Maybe I should go to
the ocean everyday? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Not hot...not cold...
{50_30_0_3}My kind of season. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This season really
deserves the title

{34_1_144}{50_30_0_9}......
Everyday is a little
cold in the Winter. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_144}{50_30_0_9}This constant cold
everyday isn't
good for my body. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you think
of our field? {NextPage_49}
I really do wonder
what someone like
you thinks... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_144}{50_30_0_9}You probably came
here because you
liked the place, {NextPage_1}I didn't expect
to come out here
and do field work. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you do breed
crops together,
you'll get a similar{NextPage_1}shape or color
as a result of
the combination. {NextPage_49}
Sometimes though,
you'll get something
entirely different. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}I feel like my body
is getting
healthier... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Don't you think
everyday is fun? {NextPage_49}
Sorry, maybe it's
only my way of
thinking... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Sorry, can't take
sit right now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_2}You're the worst.
I'm glad {CharName_2}
understood that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_2}Never come near
{CharName_2} again. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I've been
misunderstanding you.{NextPage_49}
Congratulations,
I hope you're
happy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_2}......
What do you know
anything about her? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_2}Stay out of {CharName_2}'s
business. {NextPage_49}
{CharName_2} is a
very serious girl. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_7}What am I supposed
to do now...? {NextPage_49}
Huh...?
Oh, never mind...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}You just seem
stupidly happy... {NextPage_49}
I'm sure {CharName_2}
will rethink the
marriage. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take care of
{CharName_2}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love talking
man-to-man. {NextPage_49}
At home all I have
is women, so it
wears on me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Living with women
can get very
tiring.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Hey, I'm about to
go to sleep so... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}I'm going to bed,
so get out... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}I'm on my way
out. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}I really have to
get out of here... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See ya... {NextPage_0}
