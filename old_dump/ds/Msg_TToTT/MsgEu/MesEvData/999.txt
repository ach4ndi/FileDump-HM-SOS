\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f48\u2136Let me introduce you to\u2328my beloved horse,\u2328Hayate!
\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f48\u2136I should mention that Hayate\u2328and I are pretty close.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f49\u2136But I'll bet you already\u2328figured that out.
\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f48\u2136Hayate and I actually grew\u2328up together.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f4c\u2136She gave me a lot of trouble\u2328as a kid! She wouldn't let\u2328anyone ride her.\u232bBut of course, I was too\u2328stubborn to quit trying.\u232bI fed her by hand every day\u2328until she trusted me enough\u2328to let me ride her.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f48\u2136Since then, her and I have\u2328never missed a chance to\u2328ride.\u232bBut now that she's getting\u2328older, she gets leg pains\u2328sometimes.\u232bSo I don't push her too\u2328hard these days.
\u2332 She's like family...\u2328 Let's race!\u2328
\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f49\u2136Yeah, exactly! I've known\u2328her as long as I've known\u2328anyone.\u232bShe's a part of my family.\u2328I can't imagine life without\u2328her.
\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f49\u2136Isn't that right,\u2328Hayate?
\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f49\u2136Haha, cut it out!\u2328That tickles!!
\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a, I'm glad\u2328I got to introduce you to\u2328Hayate today.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f49\u2136Seems like Hayate likes you\u2328too.
\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f49\u2136I hope you'll stop by\u2328sometime to see Hayate\u2328again.\u232bThanks for coming today,\u2328\u232a.
\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f4b\u2136C'mon, \u232a,\u2328did you even listen to me?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f4a\u2136Even as a joke,\u2328saying stuff like that\u2328isn't cool.\u232bI know I asked you to come\u2328over, but I'd like you to\u2328leave now.
