\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136Dum-Da-Da-DAA! Welcome to my\u2328spring!\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136Now, I know this is sudden,\u2328but there's something I want\u2328to ask you!\u232b\u232a, have you ever\u2328wanted to share the crops\u2328you grow with other people?
\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f49\u2136That's what I thought!\u2328I knew I could count\u2328on you!\u232bCome, follow me into the\u2328spring!
\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f49\u2136So, what do you think?\u2328I bet you weren't expecting\u2328something like this!\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f49\u2136This is the \u206dMultiplayer\u2328Field\u206c!\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136The Multiplayer Field is a\u2328special field you can use\u2328in Multiplayer Mode!\u232bWhat makes it special? Well,\u2328\u206dyou can't harvest the crops\u206c\u2328you grow here.\u232bBut you can \u206dinvite friends\u206c\u2328here, and \u206dthey can harvest\u2328the crops that you've grown\u206c!\u232bIt's a wonderful chance to\u2328share your crops with other\u2328people!\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f49\u2136Anyway, I thought I'd give\u2328you the Multiplayer Field\u2328as a present!

I'm glad you like\u2328it!\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136Anyway, you grow crops on\u2328this field a little\u2328differently than usual...\u232bIt's pretty different from a\u2328normal field. Do you want me\u2328to explain it to you?\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f49\u2136I can answer any questions\u2328you have!
dummy
\u2333 What can I do here?\u2328 How do I grow crops here?\u2328 Next.
\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136The process of growing crops\u2328on the Multiplayer Field\u2328is different than normal.\u232bUsually you need to cut\u2328down the grass with a sickle\u2328before you plant crops.\u232bBut you don't need to cut\u2328any grass here, as you can\u2328see.\u232bAlso, there's no set seasons\u2328in the Multiplayer Field.\u232bSo, before you sow your\u2328seeds, you have to use a\u2328\u206dSun\u206c to chose the season.
\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f49\u2136That's a \u206dSun\u206c right there!\u232bIf you want to change the\u2328season, \u206dput the Sun from\u2328that season there\u206c!
\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136Is there anything else you\u2328want to ask me about?
\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f49\u2136Well then, let me explain\u2328what you can do with\u2328Multiplayer Mode.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136Like I said, you can invite\u2328friends over to harvest\u2328crops you've grown...\u232b...Or you can visit a\u2328friend's field to take home\u2328some of their crops.\u232bThe first thing you'll want\u2328to do is invite a friend to\u2328your farm.\u232bNext, choose how much the\u2328\u206dentrance fee\u206c is to enter\u2328your farm.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f4b\u2136Make sure your fee's not too\u2328high, though, or no one will\u2328want to come to your farm...\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136Oh, and if you want to leave\u2328during Multiplayer Mode...
\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f49\u2136Well, good luck, then!\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136Oh! I almost forgot! It's\u2328really important!\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f49\u2136Remember to give me lots of\u2328offerings when you stop by\u2328my spring!\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136Just throw them right in the\u2328water! I'll get them!\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f49\u2136By the way, I really like\u2328sweet, red berries! Well,\u2328I'll be waiting!
\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f49\u2136...Right here! Don't forget,\u2328now!
\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136...Just exit right through\u2328there!\u232bHowever, the connection\u2328won't end until \u206dall players\u2328have exited\u206c.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f49\u2136Everyone harvests at a\u2328different pace, so be nice\u2328and wait for everyone!\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136I'll give you your collected\u2328entrance fees after you exit\u2328Multiplayer Mode.\u232bSo select \u206dContinue\u206c from the\u2328Main Menu and come back\u2328here to collect it!\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f4b\u2136\u206dYou can't invite anyone else\u206c\u2328to Multiplayer Mode until\u2328you collect the fees.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f49\u2136Oh, and if you use\u2328Multiplayer Mode a lot,\u2328I'll give you a reward!
\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136By the way, are you watering\u2328your crops every day,\u2328\u232a?\u232bNormal crops will wilt if\u2328you don't water them every\u2328day...\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f49\u2136...But the crops here won't\u2328wilt, even if you don't\u2328water them!\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136However, even though they\u2328won't wilt, they won't grow\u2328unless you water them!
\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f49\u2136But if you're busy, that\u2328means that you don't need to\u2328water your crops here!\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136You're free to raise the\u2328crops here at your own\u2328pace!
\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136In Multiplayer Mode, you can\u2328invite friends over to\u2328harvest crops you've grown!\u232bAnd you can also go to their\u2328Multiplayer Fields to\u2328harvest crops they've grown!\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f49\u2136Tee-hee! Doesn't that sound\u2328fun?\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136Oh, before I explain more,\u2328let me tell you how to go to\u2328Multiplayer Mode...\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f49\u2136First, select \u206dMultiplayer\u206c\u2328from the \u206dMain Menu\u206c.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136There are two ways to play\u2328Multiplayer Mode.\u232bTo play with \u206dnearby\u2328friends\u206c, select \u206dLocal\u2328Wireless\u206c.\u232bTo play with \u206dfar\u2328away friends\u206c, select\u2328\u206dNintendo WFC\u206c.\u232bYou'll need a \u206dwireless\u2328internet connection\u206c and\u232bat least one friend's\u2328\u206dfriend code\u206c to play over\u2328\u206dNintendo WFC\u206c, though.
\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136First, change the Sun to the\u2328season you'd like.\u232bAfter you've done that, just\u2328till the field, sow the\u2328seeds, and water them!\u232bOh, only you can't sow\u2328\u206dwheat\u206c, \u206dbuckwheat\u206c, \u206dsoybeans\u206c,\u2328or use \u206dfertilizer\u206c!\u232bKeep that in mind!
\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f49\u2136Ah, I need to show you\u2328where you can get water!\u2328You can get it...
\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136...\u270a\u270a...\u270a\u270a...\u270a\u270a\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f49\u2136Tee-hee! I'm glad you like\u2328it!\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136Anyway, you grow crops on\u2328this field a little\u2328differently than usual...\u232bIt's pretty different from a\u2328normal field. Do you want me\u2328to explain it to you?\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f49\u2136I can answer any questions\u2328you have!
\u2333 Explain friend codes.\u2328 I'm done.\u2328 Back.
\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136You need a \u206dfriend code\u206c to\u2328connect to Nintendo WFC.\u232bA friend code is a number\u2328used to distinguish between\u2328users. Everyone has one.\u232bYou can enter a friend's\u2328friend code directly in your\u2328friend roster.\u232bOr, when you connect to\u2328people over local wireless,\u232btheir friend codes will\u2328automatically be entered\u2328in your friend roster.\u232bBut if you already have\u232830 friends on your\u2328friend roster,\u232byour new friend will not\u2328be registered on your\u2328friend roster automatically.
\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f48\u2136And that's everything! Now\u2328let me take you back to your\u2328house, \u232a!\u232bI'll take you back home this\u2328time...\u232b...But next time, you'll\u2328have to get home on your\u2328own!\u232b\u1f41\u1fc6\u1f49\u2136Well, I hope I see you at\u2328the Multiplayer Field!\u2328Toodles!
