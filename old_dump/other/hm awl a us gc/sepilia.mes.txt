Oh, it's you, {CharName_0}.
Hello.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The thing about farm work is,
raising the crops is very hard work,{NextPage_49}
but watching them grow and develop
can be a lot of fun.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you like working in the
fields, {CharName_0}?
{41_2_0}I don't like it.
I don't mind it.
----------x----------
Is that so.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I take care of the crops
in the fields I feel kind of like they
give some of their energy to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You should try it too,
{CharName_0}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}Good!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Heehee.
You might think I'm strange for saying
this kind of thing, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_30}!!
Haven't you finished with the {13}Carrots{17} yet?{NextPage_1}I need them for my cooking!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What about those ingredients?{NextPage_1}Where are the {13}Carrots{17} I asked for?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmph! Men always want to goof off
all the time!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And make sure that you pick
full-grown carrots!
Not small ones, like last time!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_30}!!
Haven't you finished with the {13}Turnips{17} yet?{NextPage_1}I need them for my cooking!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where are those {13}Turnips{17}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll never finish cooking at this rate!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's enough, Marlin.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They say that the good die young.
That was certainly the case here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, please sing a
special song for {CharName_0}
up in heaven.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you want to buy something today?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Don't need anything?
{50_2_0_3}That's OK. Come back anytime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well then, what do you want?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{13}{29_0}{17}?
You have {2a_0_3} now.
How many do you want?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}Oh dear. Your rucksack is too full to fit
any {13}{29_0}{17}.
Come back after you've cleaned it out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}Oh dear, you don't have enough money.
{50_2_0_0}Come back when you have enough.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So {2a_0_2} of them
comes to {2a_1_7}G.
Is that OK?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}Thank you.
Come back anytime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, did you change your mind?
{50_2_0_1}Well, come back anytime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you need anything else?
{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you're selling things.
Mind if I take a look?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, let me see what you've
got here!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, you don't have anything, do you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I'd better come earlier next time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm... I guess there's nothing I
want here today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry.
There's nothing I want here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I'll buy the {29_0}.
How much is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
{34_1_148}Really?
{50_2_0_3}Thanks!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I guess I'll take it then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh...
I guess that wasn't for sale.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, bye. I'll be back.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This {29_0} looks good.
How much is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}Hello. Sigh.....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}Oh, it's nothing... Sigh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_2}I said it's nothing!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}I'm just not feeling very well today.
I'm sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Good morning.
Let's work hard today!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Hello.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Good evening.
Let's get plenty of rest for tomorrow!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Oh, thank goodness it's you.
At this time of night, I get a little
nervous. I'm glad it was only you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}My, what are you doing out at this hour?
Who did you want to see?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Oh, welcome.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Oh, I didn't expect to see you this late.
Do you always stay up so late?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Hello.
Do you come here often?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}My, that looks delicious.
{41_2_0}Have some.
It's not for you.
----------x----------
Is it really OK?
{34_1_147}How nice. Thank you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_148}{50_2_0_10}Hmm?
Don't worry. I won't steal it or anything.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}{50_2_0_3}That looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, you have something nice there.
{41_2_0}Give it to her.
Don't give it to her.
----------x----------
{50_2_0_1}Are you sure?
{50_2_0_3}I'll take good care of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you like that kind of thing,
do you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}That's wonderful.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_148}Oh dear, I don't like that kind of thing.
I know I shouldn't be so picky, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}You know, just thinking of
how that tastes makes me feel ill.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}What is that? You're not going
to try and give it to me, are you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}Yuck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}My, {CharName_1}.
Are you on a walk with your Mommy?
How nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see {CharName_26} out on the town often.
You guys are married and all.
Does he go home at night?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}My, {CharName_1}.
Are you on a walk with your Mommy?
How nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_20}'s son...
I bet he'll become a musician.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}...
Be sure to come and visit us at the farm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_30}'s kids...
I'm looking forward to their growing up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you taking {23} for a walk?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}Good doggie.
Yes, who's a good boy?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Oh, a cat?
How cute.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}Good kitty.
Cute kitty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a fine looking chicken.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute little chick.
Was it born at {24_2}Farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Chickens lay eggs, so they're very good
to have around. Is that a female?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, that's very big.
Is it a duck?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How cute.
Is that a duck?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ducks are kind of cute
once you get used to them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you planting now?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope {24_2}Farm
has a bumper crop this year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_148}Oh, is that from {24_2}Farm?
How nice!
{41_2_0}Give it to her.
Don't give it to her.
----------x----------
{34_1_148}For me? Oh, you want us
to tell you what we think of it?
OK. We'll all give it a try.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's both keep up the hard
work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks quite good.
You've done well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk looks good.
It's from {24_2}Farm, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet milk from your own farm
must taste especially good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, did you make some cheese?
{50_2_0_3}Wow.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Making cheese sounds like a lot of work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, did you make some butter?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I make butter sometimes, too.
But I do it by hand, so you have to
keep churning and churning.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, an egg.
Did one of your chickens lay it?
{41_2_0}Give it to her.
Don't give it to her.
----------x----------
{34_1_147}{50_2_0_3}I'm so happy!
I'll use it in tonight's dinner.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm making a lot of egg dishes these days.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to keep chickens on our farm,
but everyone's so busy with our crops that
we wouldn't have time to care for them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, good job.
{50_2_0_3}You caught that, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You should cook it while it's
still fresh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, that looks tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If there are still some growing there,
maybe I should go collect some myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, that turned out very well.
It looks quite good.
{41_2_0}Try it.
I'll eat it later.
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}Really?
Well, thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If it's good, you must give me the recipe.
Cooking is a hobby of mine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}Be sure and give me some good recipes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, what strange hoe.
Do you use it like a normal hoe?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like something like that, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an unusual hoe.
Does it work well?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You like growing things, don't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that your hoe?
You haven't used it much yet, have you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got to break it in more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that your hoe?
Mine is an old one of Vesta's,
so it's older than that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks like a good hoe.
Use it well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, that's impressive.
You certainly used that a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_1}You're really working hard on your crops!
Wow!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a strange shape.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks pretty sharp.
But maybe you shouldn't go walking
around with it. You could hurt someone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, what an unusual sickle.
You use that in your fields?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to try using that.
I wonder how it compares to a normal one.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow.
{50_2_0_3}That sickle's brand new!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You haven't used that at all.
You've got to break it in.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, is that your sickle?
Mine is more broken in than that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You probably shouldn't carry that around.
{50_2_0_9}It's dangerous.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, you've used that sickle quite a lot.
If you don't sharpen it, it must get
dull very quickly.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think it's great you've used it so much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an unusual watering can.
Is it used differently from normal ones?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a nice watering can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That watering can is spotless.
That must make watering fun.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You are watering your crops, right?
It looks like you're not using it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that your watering can?
Watering crops is fun, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you water your crops, check them to
see how they're doing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My! What an old watering can!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You must really be working hard to have
used it that much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, that's new, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your milking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's used for milking cows,
isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope you get some good milk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's used for milking cows,
isn't it?{NextPage_1}It's pretty old, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you want to produce good milk, I think
a clean milker would be best.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, so you use those to
shear your sheep?
That looks difficult...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Shearing sheep seems challenging.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you use those to shear
your sheep?
That looks fun.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Shearing sheep looks like fun.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is it sheep shearing season now?
We work all year round here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't the sheep catch cold or
something when they're sheared?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those clippers have been used a lot.
You're used to shearing, then?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like sheared sheep.
They're so cute.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, you have a new tool.
How nice!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you get a new tool do you sometimes
invent work just so you can use it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Going to work now?
Good luck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We both need to work hard. I'm sure we'll
get better at our jobs soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, that's been used a lot, hasn't it?
Did you do that all by yourself?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's nothing like a well-used tool.
After you use one for a long time
it seems like it grows to fit your hand.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}What a nice stone.
{50_2_0_0}Are you going to go sell that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's very nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got something interesting there.
Do you sell those?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You like those type of things?
How odd of you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's a wild plant, isn't it?
Did you pick it yourself?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Try not to collect too many
of them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, that's a record, isn't it?
Do you have a record
player?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Listening to music is relaxing, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}My, did {CharName_25} give you that?
How nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_25}'s such a good cook, I'm
thinking of taking lessons from her.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}My, what a pretty gold medal!
That's {CharName_11}'s, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I would've kept it as a memento, myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
............
That's nicely decorated.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take good care of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, is that {CharName_9}'s?
Maybe she gave it to you to keep
until she's ready to play that piece?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Keep it safe.
You can give it back to {CharName_9} when
she's ready to play it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_148}!
Oh, you scared me.
{50_2_0_9}Does that have gunpowder inside?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you're going to set off fireworks,
be careful not to burn yourself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If it's something important,
you'd better take good care of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I lived with my parents in the {Location_43_31_23},
{CharName_29} used to deliver fresh
vegetables to our house.
----------x----------
The people in this town weren't too happy
when {CharName_29} brought me here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But I'm glad I came to {Location_43_30_23}.
Even if it meant leaving my parents.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me
was very good.
{50_2_0_3}I love that kind of thing!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me
could use a little more work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me
was really good.
Keep up the good work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me
was very good.{NextPage_49}
Really.
Even {CharName_29} was
surprised.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That {29_0} was delicious.
{50_2_0_3}I like that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you made
was very good.
You'll have to give me the recipe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you made
was good.
{50_2_0_3}You've been working hard at cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I ate the {29_0} you made.
Thanks...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think you're a lot better at
your job now.
{50_2_0_3}You're a real farmer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're quite good at raising crops,
aren't you?{NextPage_49}
I'm still such an amateur.
I really respect you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've a good cook,
Do you know that?
Maybe you could teach me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've been working hard on your farm.
{50_2_0_3}I think it's great how seriously
you're taking your work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Raising crops isn't easy, but you're
doing your best.
We both need to work hard.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you often cook at home?
I've heard you're pretty good.
That's just great!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess you're getting used to life
on the farm, huh?
Keep up the good work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess you're getting used to
growing crops, huh?
{50_2_0_3}We both need to keep working at it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You cook, don't you?
Me too!
If you find any good recipes, tell me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My room is in the attic.
But I like it a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you like your current lifestyle?
{50_2_0_3}Me? I love living
here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}'s really cute.
I bet running around a farm is great
for a child's development.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------


----------x----------
{CharName_1} seems bigger.
I wonder if he will
take over the farm after you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Raising children must be very difficult.
When they get to a certain age, they
probably don't listen to their parents.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}'s all grown up
now.
Time certainly does fly.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love houses made from wood.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Vesta sometimes bakes bread for
us, you know.
It's really good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Marlin may seem like he's always in a
bad mood, but he's really a kind man.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's nice to come to a place like this
every once in a while.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's take it easy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Vesta's vegetables
are the best!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It was so nice of you to come.
I can't even offer you any refreshments...
But feel free to stop by anytime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your crops.
I'm sure they'll be delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This kind of place always relaxes
me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Sigh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everything seems so fresh and new
at this time of year. I love it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is my favorite time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can hear the little songbirds and
see the flowers blooming...
They're so cute.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
For farms this time of year is the
busiest. Vesta's really working hard.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you have some free time, maybe you
could go flower-viewing with us. We could
have a picnic. Doesn't that sound nice?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just can't keep my mind focused today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}Whew. It's hot.
{50_2_0_1}How's everyone at {24_2}Farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's work hard so that
the crops do well!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}It sure is hot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Make sure not to overwork the animals.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's so hot at this time of year,
cooking must be difficult, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to eat some nice juicy fruit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The weather seems a lot more
comfortable, doesn't it? I like to draw
pictures and read books in the fall.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are so many delicious foods
available in the fall.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's pretty great if you think about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Aren't autumn leaves just
beautiful?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like to pick up fallen leaves to
use as bookmarks.
Isn't that a good idea?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whenever I hear the crickets chirping
I like to stop and listen to them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's pretty cold.
How's everyone at {24_2}Farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You should have some hot food
to warm yourself up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't really like the cold very much,
{50_2_0_3}but I always feel happy when it snows.
It's so pretty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be careful that your animals don't
catch cold.
Oh, and that goes for you, too!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When there's frost on the ground in the
morning, I just can't get myself moving.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish spring would hurry up and get here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was looking at the crops.
I hope they will grow really big.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are your fields like,
anyway?
I should go take a look.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, it's you.
You like it here too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love the sound of leaves in
the wind. If you listen to them for
a long time, it's almost hypnotic.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}I'm sorry. I don't want to
think about anything right now.{NextPage_49}
But I guess I can't be like this
forever...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
..................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_7}I'm sorry.
I can't talk to you.
I'll just start crying again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_7}Just leave me alone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_7}You don't...
You don't have to worry about me anymore.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}How much do I really know about you,
{CharName_0}?
I'm a little worried.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm busy right now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't worry.
Maybe it was for the best.{NextPage_49}
I just need some time to think by myself.
I'm sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, it's you!
I'm having so much fun these days!
I'm so very happy!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello.
I've been thinking about you a lot.{NextPage_49}
{CharName_29} scolded me for
daydreaming all the time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was just thinking about you.
And to have you show up.
That must be more than a coincidence.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
