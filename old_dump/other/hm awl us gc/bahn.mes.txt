Give this little
one a name. {NextPage_49}
Let's also decide
on a feed box. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Input_128}...
Some name... {NextPage_49}
Well, take good
care of her. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think she likes
you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll even throw in
the {13}{25_4_248}. {NextPage_49}
You'll find it in
the {Location_43_48_23}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ahhh. {NextPage_49}
As I expected,
there's lots of
expensive things. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I enjoy looking, but
of course that just
makes me want them. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It can't be!!
There's nothing
like that! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've never seen
a picture like that
before. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
T-that's amazing!! {NextPage_49}
Did you buy that
from the artist
himself? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You mean it's a
Ronet!? {NextPage_49}
Isn't she the
creator of
surrealism? {NextPage_49}
On top of that
it's unusual to see
a female painter. {NextPage_49}
Doesn't she have a
son called Romany? {NextPage_49}
I should get her
autograph... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're what...?
Can I just look at
it a little more? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's horrible. {NextPage_1}I'll be sure to
bring a great deal
of money next time! {NextPage_49}
Please take care of
it until I come back.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll just put that
over here for now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Any child would love
that. {NextPage_49}
It's hard to get,
even in the city,
so take care of it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now then... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've got to get back
to my shop, so if
you'll excuse me... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you want to sell
that? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
You can't sell
that to me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That will be {2a_0_0}G.
Is that okay? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
That's too bad. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you very much. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome.
Can I help you?
{41_3_0}Sell.
Buy.
Never mind.
----------x----------
What are you
selling today? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What would you
like to buy? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Unfortunately you
don't have enough
money for that. {NextPage_49}
Please come back
when you have the
right amount. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Unfortunately you
have too many items. {NextPage_49}
Please try getting
that another time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you for your
business. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's too bad. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You have a good eye.
That goat is prime
for milking. {NextPage_49}
I'll even throw in
a milker for {2a_0_0}G.
How about it?
{41_3_0}Buy.
Never mind.
Discount?
----------x----------
You have a good eye.
That is the rare
ugly faced doll. {NextPage_49}
Right now it goes
for only {2a_0_0}G.
Do you want it?
{41_3_0}Buy.
Never mind.
Discount?
----------x----------
You have a good eye. {NextPage_49}
That is a precious
vase from a far off
foreign land. {NextPage_49}
It's only {2a_0_0}G.
{41_3_0}Buy.
Never mind.
Discount?
----------x----------
I was thinking about
traveling to some
unknown village. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you know of a
place called
Mineral Town...? {NextPage_49}
I'd like to visit
there sometime. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...
Well how about
{2a_0_0}G?
{41_2_0}I'll take it.
Never mind.
----------x----------
Hmmm...
Well then how about
{2a_0_0}G?
{41_2_0}I'll take it.
No thanks.
----------x----------
You're a good
bargainer...
How's {2a_0_0}G?
{41_2_0}You win.
I changed my mind.
----------x----------
You're quite
unyielding... {NextPage_49}
Fine, what about
{2a_0_0}G?
{41_2_0}That's better.
Nah, never mind.
----------x----------
You are extremely
stubborn aren't you? {NextPage_49}
This is my final
offer. {2a_0_0}G?
{41_2_0}Deal.
Give up.
----------x----------
Glad to see we could
make a deal. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's unfortunate we
weren't able to
make a deal... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...
Well how does
{2a_0_0}G sound?
{41_3_0}Buy.
No thanks.
Lower?
----------x----------
I see...
Well how does
{2a_0_0}G sound?
{41_3_0}Buy.
No thanks.
Lower?
----------x----------
Hmmm...
That puts me in
quite a position... {NextPage_49}
How about we do
{2a_0_0}G?
{41_3_0}Buy.
No thanks.
Lower?
----------x----------
You're very shrewd
aren't you... {NextPage_49}
I see, you'd rather
it be {2a_0_0}G.
What do you say?
{41_3_0}Buy.
No thanks.
Lower?
----------x----------
You just won't budge,
will you? {NextPage_49}
This is my final
offer. {2a_0_0}G.
Well?
{41_3_0}Buy.
No thanks.
Lower?
----------x----------
I'll be delivering
that to you then. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's unfortunate we
were unable to reach
a compromise... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
One of those is
{2a_0_0}G. {32_2_188}
You have {2a_1_0}.
How many will you
sell? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay, {32_3_232}
Van's Shop is open
for business. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come on everybody! {32_1_244}
Come buy lots of
great things! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Time to close up
shop. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's it for
today. {NextPage_1}{32_3_232}Guess I'll go
home... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm...{32_1_244}
How about over here?{NextPage_49}
{32_1_244}This room would be
perfect...
Hmm... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is a pretty
rare item so take
good care of it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll be on my
way then... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, you've
really helped out. {NextPage_49}
It'll be lonely
without you... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}.
How about a song
in honor of {CharName_0}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pardon me... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You really should
have your products
ready when you open. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was hoping to buy
something rare... {NextPage_49}
But there's
nothing here... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm looking for
something rare. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Not too many good
things here... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really like that
{29_0}.
How much is it?
{41_3_2}{2a_1_5}G for you.
{2a_2_5}G.
Not for sale.
----------x----------
{50_36_0_9}{34_1_157}I'd really like to
ask for a discount
but... {32_1_244}{NextPage_1}Fine, you've got a
deal. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm, is that the
best you can do? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a little pricey
but... that's okay,
I'll take it. {NextPage_49}
Just make sure to
repay the favor in
my shop sometime. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Never mind then... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How much is that
{29_0}?
{41_3_2}It's only {2a_1_5}G.
{2a_2_5}G.
Not for sale.
----------x----------
I guess that's all
for me today. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please stop by
my shop again
sometime. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The name's Van. {NextPage_49}
I travel all across
the world selling
rare items. {NextPage_49}
Very pleased to
meet you. {NextPage_49}
My shop will be open
on the 3rd and the
8th each month... {NextPage_49}
Please stop by
whenever you feel
the need... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_7}...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_7}I'm tired today... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good morning. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello, there. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good evening. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing
up so late at
night? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_10}Ah, that's my
favorite food.
C-can I have it? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_3}Are you sure it's
okay?
Thank you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I understand... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_157}You've really got
something good
there. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_3}Is that on the
house? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
If that's the
case then I'll
buy it from you. {NextPage_49}
Bring it by my
shop and I'll pay
you well for it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's very nice. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks, I'll pass. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't like that
at all. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's really
worthless... {NextPage_49}
If you want to
sell it, bring it
by my shop. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_10}He's a cute one. {NextPage_49}
Don't forget to
buy him a toy from
my shop. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He's so cute. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've got the perfect
toy for him. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry I don't
deal in dogs. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry I don't
deal in cats. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not buying
that from you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ducks can't warm
their own eggs. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We normally don't
deal in those, but
if you want to sell {NextPage_1}it, come on by
the shop. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll buy that from
you when I'm open
for business. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you want to sell
that, come by when
I'm open. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We don't really
deal too much in
food supplies... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_3}Is that one on
the house? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_3}Don't mind if I do. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Of course it's
not. {NextPage_49}
It's merchandise
after all... {NextPage_49}
Come by and sell
it to me sometime...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you have a
pasture on your
farm as well... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd be grateful for
some low calorie
milk... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd be grateful for
some low calorie
cheese... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd be grateful for
some low calorie
butter... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm avoiding eggs
because they're
high cholesterol. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nobody is going to
want to buy a
used fish... {NextPage_49}
{50_36_0_3}Ha ha ha! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you cook that?
It looks delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_3}Is that for me?
{41_2_1}Of course.
Don't eat it.
----------x----------
{50_36_0_9}{34_1_157}I'm glad you'd think
of me, but I'm on
a diet now... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_9}Really?
I guess that's the
way it is. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's some good
looking food. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_9}That just pains me
to look at that.
Please take it away. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's brand
spanking-new. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's just a
normal hoe. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a dirty
looking hoe. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a very sharp
looking sickle. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's brand
spanking new. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a normal
sickle. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a dirty
looking sickle. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's brand
spanking new. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's just a normal
watering can. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That watering can
is old. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's brand
spanking new. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's just a
normal milker. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a dirty
looking milker. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are some
old shears. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are brand
spanking new. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are just some
normal shears. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a very
rare stone. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_157}That looks like
something that would
excite fanatics... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are all types
of record genres. {NextPage_49}
We have many in
stock, so come see
them sometime. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a peculiar
looking necklace. {NextPage_49}
There must be some
reason for it... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_157}Fireworks?
We don't deal with
weaponry... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I loved traveling
to all different
places to find all {NextPage_1}sorts of rare items
that I could sell
on the road. {NextPage_49}
So I became a
traveling salesman.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you find any
rarities, please
sell them to me. {NextPage_49}
I'll give you a
good price on
them. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes I travel
to Mineral Town. {NextPage_49}
I usually see my
fellow salesman
Won. {NextPage_49}
He's more of a
flashy salesperson. {NextPage_49}
Don't tell him
I said that... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It seems that the
farm owner in
Mineral Town has {NextPage_1}saved away quite
a bit of money. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} of
Mineral Town
walked 1,000,000{NextPage_1}steps... {NextPage_49}
I wonder if he's on
a diet... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer in
Mineral Town
has bad taste. {NextPage_49}
He likes to collect
raw gold... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer in
Mineral Town owns 3
vacation houses. {NextPage_49}
He doesn't even
have that much
family... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_3}{34_1_156}That food you gave
me last time was
very delicious. {NextPage_49}
I'll get fat
again if I'm not
careful. {NextPage_49}
Ho ho ho! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That food you gave
me last time
tasted bad. {NextPage_49}
At least it helped
keep me on my
diet... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you
gave me last time
was so-so. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_3}{34_1_156}The {29_0} you
gave me last time
tasted great. {NextPage_49}
I mean it! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave
me last time really
wasn't that good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave
me last time tasted
so-so. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave
me last time tasted
good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk you gave
me last time tasted
wonderful. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_3}The milk you gave
me last time tasted
the best. {NextPage_49}
It's got to be
number one! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk you gave
me last time smelled
a little... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The cheese I got
before was very
rich and tasty. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The cheese I got
before smelled a
little, but {NextPage_1}I think it could
become quite
addicting... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The cheese I got
before as so-so. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The butter I got
before was very
rich and tasty. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The butter I got
before smelled a
little, but {NextPage_1}I think it could
become quite
addicting... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The butter I got
before was above
average butter. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The butter I got
before was so-so.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_3}The fish you caught
for me last time
tasted great. {NextPage_49}
I gobbled it up
in an instant. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The fish you caught
for me last time
tasted so-so. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lately your dairy
products are very
high quality. {NextPage_49}
Looks like you've
become a great
farmer. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got quite a
good reputation for
raising crops. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're really trying
hard on your farm. {NextPage_49}
Any day now you'll
have a huge
breakthrough. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your crops have a
great reputation. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_10}I love when people
come visit my shop
on business. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I try not to eat
too many extras
with my food. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I come here,
I always go back
later than expected.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's hard to get to
to Forget Valley,
but that's the life {NextPage_1}of a traveling
salesman. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It will be hard
to come here when
it gets hotter. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_2}It's so hot. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sweating this
much and still I
don't lose weight! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's gotten nice
and cooler now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The air here is much
better than compared
with the city. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Even in this cold,
I still sweat from
walking here...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The snow never
sticks here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't really do
much business when
it's cold. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's lots of nice
things here that I'd
love to buy, but not {NextPage_1}many people are
willing to sell
them to me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Romana doesn't want
to sell any of her
things, but I won't {NextPage_1}be giving up that
easily... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if Romana
is good at business
or if she's {NextPage_1}just picking on me.{NextPage_49}
I'm really not
sure. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if Romana
is good at business
or if she's {NextPage_1}just picking on me.{NextPage_49}
I'm really not
sure. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I always wonder if
Carter will sell any
of his discoveries {NextPage_1}to me, so I come
here often. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes really
rare relics
are found here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you also
excavate? {NextPage_1}If you find anything
rare, I'll pay you
top dollar for it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today was another
bad day for business.
Time to head home...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your
business, man. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm thinking about
going back to
Mineral Town again. {NextPage_49}
There's a lot of
interesting things
there. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This thing called
effort is really
quite amusing! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_0}!
You came at just the
right time... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was just about to
tell Tim how the
Matkins diet Romana {NextPage_1}told me to try
turned out. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
At first I wondered
if it would work. {NextPage_49}
You're supposed to
walk around your
room with your eyes {NextPage_1}closed and open and
close your hands. {NextPage_49}
You do this two
times a day. {NextPage_49}
According to recent
reports, this is the
best diet out! {NextPage_49}
After 10 days of
doing this, I went
to go weigh myself. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Boy was I surprised!
{50_36_0_0}I lost 20 pounds!{NextPage_49}
{50_36_0_10}I guess all that
walking into walls
helped after all! {NextPage_49}
Ha ha ha! {32_2_188}
{41_2_0}The scale is wrong...
Congratulations!
----------x----------
Thanks a lot. {NextPage_49}
I'm going to stick
to this diet for
a while!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Tim should give it
a try too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If I can do it,
anyone can!
Ha ha ha! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whoops, I almost
forgot to tell
Romana my results... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll be seeing
you around then! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
M-maybe you're
right. {NextPage_49}
I thought it was
the effects of
my diet but... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
(sigh)... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Who'd have thought
that effort could
do this! {NextPage_49}
Ha ha ha! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Last time was a
failure, but this
time was different. {NextPage_49}
This time I spun
around like a top
with my eyes closed {NextPage_1}in the middle of
my room. {NextPage_49}
I did this twice
a day... {NextPage_49}
According to recent
reports, this is the
best diet out! {NextPage_49}
I did this for
10 days and then
weighed myself {NextPage_1}on my brand new
special scale. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Boy, was I surprised!{NextPage_49}
{50_36_0_0}I dropped all the way
to 150 lbs. {NextPage_49}
{50_36_0_10}I guess all that
spinning and falling
down helped! {32_2_188}
{41_2_0}It only goes to 150.
Congratulations!!
----------x----------
If I can do it,
anybody can!
Ha ha ha! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
M-maybe you're
right. {NextPage_49}
I really thought
it was because
of the diet... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Last time was a
failure so I tried
a new diet. {NextPage_49}
15 times a day I
run right into a
strong pillar. {NextPage_49}
According to recent
reports, this is the
best diet out! {NextPage_49}
I did that for
10 days and then
got on my brand {NextPage_1}new electric
scale. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Boy, was I surprised!
{50_36_0_0}I dropped down 50lbs! {NextPage_49}
{50_36_0_10}It must have been
all the collisions
into the pillars. {NextPage_1}Ha ha ha! {32_2_188}
{41_2_0}No battery in scale.
Congratulations!
----------x----------
All the other diets
failed, but this
time I succeeded. {NextPage_49}
Twice a day I climb
up Daryl's roof to
touch the current. {NextPage_49}
According to recent
reports, this is the
best diet out! {NextPage_49}
I did that for
10 days straight
and then got on {NextPage_1}my brand new
metric scale. {NextPage_0}

This time I found
a really good
diet in spite of {NextPage_1}all my previous
failures! {NextPage_49}
21 times a day I
run to the beach,
yell at the sun and {NextPage_1}roll around in
the sand. {NextPage_49}
According to recent
reports, this is the
best diet out! {NextPage_49}
I did this for 10
days straight and
then got on my{NextPage_1}new scale. {NextPage_0}

my shorts was

Ha ha ha! {32_2_188}
{41_2_0}It's the fat ratio.
Congratulations!

I really didn't
do to well up to
now, but this time {NextPage_1}I'm sure I figured
out a good one. {NextPage_49}
Everyday I have
a staring contest
with Murrey. {NextPage_49}
According to recent
reports, this is the
best diet out! {NextPage_49}
I did this for
10 days straight
and then got on {NextPage_1}my new "sitting"
style scale. {NextPage_0}

best diet out. {NextPage_49}

Boy was I surprised!
{50_36_0_0}I lost a little bit. {NextPage_49}
{50_36_0_10}I guess all those

Oh, it's {CharName_0}. {NextPage_49}
{CharName_8} told me
if I ran from the
{Location_43_31_23} to {NextPage_1}the {Location_43_34_23}
everyday, I'd get a lot
thinner. {NextPage_49}
It's a lot harder
than I thought. {NextPage_49}
I figured I'd run
from the {Location_43_30_23}
to the inn's door. {NextPage_49}
But...whew... {NextPage_49}
Looks like I'll be
running to the
{Location_43_34_23} now. {NextPage_49}
I'll be on my way
then... {NextPage_0}
