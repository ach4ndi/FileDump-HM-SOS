Hmmm... {32_2_188}
Ahh... {32_2_188}
I see... {32_2_188}
----------x----------
{36_1}{34_1_100}!!{32_5_220}{36_0}{NextPage_49}
Oh, it's just you.
Don't surprise me
like that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You want to know
what I'm doing? {NextPage_49}
I can't really
explain what I'm
doing, but... {NextPage_49}
I guess it can't
hurt... {NextPage_49}
I'll tell you as
a favor. {NextPage_49}
I've been doing some
research regarding
the weird life form {NextPage_1}that has been seen
around here lately. {NextPage_49}
I've seen it myself,
and I'm sure it's
not human. {NextPage_49}
I wonder what it
could be. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}That must be
the strange beings
identity. {NextPage_49}
I've seen him before,
but if I could take
him alive... {35_0}{32_7_8}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_100}? ? ?{32_5_220}{NextPage_49}
What's wrong?
Your face looks very
pale... {32_3_232}
----------x----------
Ahhhhhhhhh! {32_7_208}
----------x----------
Wha...{32_1_144}Wha...{32_1_144}
W-What's thaaat!?{32_1_144}
----------x----------
Hmm, now I see. {32_1_244}
----------x----------
Of course!
So that's what a
child would do!{NextPage_49}
I've got some good
data now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Ahhh! {32_1_144}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I-I'm not doing
anything suspicious! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was just a little
curious about how
children act! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Uwaaa! {32_1_144}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Owowowowow... {32_1_144}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I-I don't have
anything against
cows! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay!
It'll be that cow! {NextPage_49}
Heh heh heh!
Today I'll have my
revenge at last. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's strange.
There was a leak. {NextPage_49}
I was sure that my
research was a total
secret. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{36_1}{34_1_100}!!{32_5_220}{36_0}Oh, it's you.
Don't surprise me
like that. {NextPage_49}
I'll think that
you're a spy trying
to steal my ideas! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Will you listen
to me? {NextPage_49}
I developed this
{Location_43_0_23}. {NextPage_49}
Now they sell a
fake version of it
in the city. {NextPage_49}
There's no doubt
in my mind someone
stole my idea. {NextPage_49}
That's it!
I'll give you my
{Location_43_0_23}. {NextPage_49}
If you use it, then
everyone will see
my genius at work! {NextPage_49}
Come on!
We've got work
to do. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm doing research
about lightning now.{NextPage_49}
According to my
calculations,
if I could find a {NextPage_1}way to harness that
lightning, we could
have a years worth {NextPage_1}of power for the
whole town! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
First, I have to
make a power plant
that can hold at {NextPage_1}least a months worth
of power for the
town. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Here we goooo! {NextPage_49}
There! {32_1_244}{NextPage_49}
I'm sucking in the
lightning's power
down into the {NextPage_1}lab's underground
batteries. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ooooooh!! {32_0_100}
It's beautiful!! {32_0_100}
So much energy!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......!?
What the... {32_3_132}
Owwww...I'm numb...!{32_1_144}
----------x----------
Hmmm...
Guess it still needs
some work. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{41_2_0}Run away.
Stay here.
----------x----------
{34_1_100}{32_5_220}Oh, it's just you.
You want something?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Nothing really.
What are you doing?
----------x----------
I see.
If that's the reason
head back home. {NextPage_49}
I'm about to begin
a very important
experiment. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm doing research
on solar batteries. {NextPage_49}
If we can harness
the power of the
sun, we could power {NextPage_1}the town, no, they
very world! {NextPage_49}
There would be no
limit! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
First, I have to
complete a plant
that could operate {NextPage_1}the town on solar
batteries. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_101}{32_1_244}This is the heart of
the project! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're actually very
lucky. {NextPage_49}
You get to observe
the first trial run
of my new invention. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Here we go!
Switch on! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Here we go!!
Voltage stability
is rising!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_100}{32_5_220}Hmmm!?
This can' be! {32_3_232}
----------x----------
Don't worry it was
just the breaker. {NextPage_49}
I have to go replace
the circuit. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, it's just you.
What brings you
here? {NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Nothing really.
What are you doing?
----------x----------
Hey, where are you
going? {NextPage_49}
Come here for a
second. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm doing some
research on water
resources now. {NextPage_49}
The towns drinking
water comes from
underground. {NextPage_49}
However, it's not
an unlimited
resource. {NextPage_49}
The underground
reservoir is formed
by rain water so, {NextPage_1}If we could catch
the water somehow, {NextPage_1}we could have as
much as the sea. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now. {NextPage_49}
If we had a tank
large enough to
store the rainwater, {NextPage_1}we could supply
both our town and
the next with water! {NextPage_49}
----------x----------
Of course even rain
water has harmful
properties to it. {NextPage_49}
You can't just
drink it as is. {NextPage_49}
But once my water
filtration system
is complete, {NextPage_1}we won't have any
more problems. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_101}{32_1_244}Behold, my latest
invention! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're actually very
lucky. {NextPage_49}
You get to observe
the first trial run
of my new invention. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh! It's you.
You came at the
perfect time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come here for a
second.
{41_2_0}I've got to go...
No way.
----------x----------
I'm not going to
take that much of
your time. {NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Well, okay...
No way.
----------x----------
I wasn't planning
on taking up too
much of your time. {NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Well okay...
No way.
----------x----------
Listen for a second. {NextPage_49}
I'm doing research
on how we can stop
global warming. {NextPage_49}
You know that people
inhale oxygen and
exhale carbon- {NextPage_1}dioxide over and
over right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The vegetation of
Earth breaks down
the carbon-dioxide {NextPage_1}through the process
commonly known as
photosynthesis. {NextPage_49}
However, due to
deforestation
actions by humans, {NextPage_1}the plants aren't
around to make
oxygen again. {NextPage_49}
That's what causes
global warming. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now. {NextPage_49}
If we can change
CO2 to O2 then we
can stop the entire {NextPage_1}global warming
crisis and save
the Earth! {NextPage_49}
----------x----------
I'm doing research
right now on a
recycling process {NextPage_1}for electrical
appliances and
devices. {NextPage_49}
Usually we just
throw broken things
away in the landfill. {NextPage_49}
However, these
landfills are not
unlimited. {NextPage_49}
----------x----------
Now. {NextPage_49}
It disassembles
broken electronics
into their base {NextPage_1}parts and material
structures. {NextPage_49}
It then classifies
them according to
purpose, and makes {NextPage_1}them reusable in
future electronics. {NextPage_49}
No more worries
about landfill space
and no more having {NextPage_1}to make new parts
all the time. {NextPage_49}
It's killing
two birds with
one stone! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmmm...{NextPage_49}
Seems it's going to
take more power than
I realized. {NextPage_49}
Looks like it's
going to cost more
to recycle than to {NextPage_1}dispose of it in
the landfills... {NextPage_49}
I still need to
work on this. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're actually very
lucky... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_100}Huh? {32_5_220}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, where are you
going? {NextPage_49}
You were going to
get to observe
the first trial run!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Heh heh heh! {32_1_144}
Ah ha ha ha ha! {NextPage_49}
At last my time
has finally come! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You filthy cows.
At long last I'll
have my revenge. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder which I'll
use as component for
my experiment... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
♪ Dum de dum ♪
♪ Dum dum de dum ♪ {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder which cow
I'll take. ♪ {32_3_232}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{36_1}{34_1_100}!!{32_5_220}{36_0}{NextPage_49}
Y-Y-You.
I wasn't doing
anything suspicious! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I-I don't have any
plans for the cows. {NextPage_49}
I was just walking
past them... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I-if you have free
time, come see my
at the lab again. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I-I love animals.
T-they're so cute
and cuddly. {NextPage_49}
Like these cows
for example... {32_3_232}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I-{32_0_200}I- {32_0_200}...
I'm gonna diieeee! {32_3_232}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmmm...
Hmmmm... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whyyyyyyy! {32_3_232}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wwwwwwhyyyyyyy! {32_3_232}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Something's wrong.
Something's really
wrong. {NextPage_49}
My super secret lab
was so perfectly
hidden! {NextPage_49}
So how are my
ideas being
stolen!? {NextPage_49}
Grrr... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{36_1}{34_1_100} !! {32_5_220}{36_0}
Oh, it's you.{NextPage_49}
Don't sneak up
on me like that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought it was
a spy come to steal
my ideas. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Listen to me!
I developed this
{Location_43_0_23}. {NextPage_49}
Now they sell a
fake version of it
in the city. {NextPage_49}
There's no doubt
in my mind someone
stole my idea. {NextPage_49}
It's really
detestable... {NextPage_49}
Now nobody will be
able to see my
genius at work... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's it!
I'll give you
my {Location_43_0_23}. {NextPage_49}
If you use it, then
the world can see
my invention work! {NextPage_49}
----------x----------
Okay!
We've got work
to do. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It is done. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going back to
my laboratory. {NextPage_49}
I have so many
experiments to
work on!{NextPage_49}
Use my invention
as much as
you want! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Here...
Right here too...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}I was careless
before, but you won't
escape this time {NextPage_1}you ridiculous
walking carpet! {35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{36_1}{34_1_100}!!{32_5_220}{36_0}
Oh, its you.{NextPage_49}
Don't sneak up
on me like that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What was I doing?
I suppose it can't
hurt to tell you. {NextPage_49}
I'm planning on
capturing the
white-haired being. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}According to
my calculations,
he'll get hungry, {NextPage_1}come looking for
food, and then
I'll have him!! {NextPage_49}
I've got a
100% chance of
success!! {35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}{50_19_0_3}I'll lure him back
to the lab with
food and then{NextPage_1}knock him out using
powerful electric
shocks! {NextPage_49}
{50_19_0_0}This plan needs
a name! {32_2_188}{NextPage_49}
{34_1_101}{32_2_188}I'll call it
"Super Ultra Trap
Plan 1". {NextPage_49}
{50_19_0_4}Mwa ha ha ha ha! {32_2_188}
It's prefect! {32_2_188}
I can't fail! {NextPage_49}
Mwa ha ha ha! {32_1_144}
{34_1_99}{32_5_220}I'm a genius! {NextPage_49}
Whew...
Got a little carried
away there. {NextPage_49}
Curses!
My calm and cool
image is ruined... {NextPage_49}
After my plan is
complete I'll give
you something. {35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_0}??? {32_5_220}
What's wrong? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_4}W-w-what are you
doing!? {NextPage_49}
That took a weeks
worth of food money!{NextPage_49}
My foolproof plan!
You've just
spoiled everything! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How can this be!?
It was perfect! {NextPage_49}
I'll just have to
make another plan
then!! {NextPage_49}
Next time...
I won't...
fail... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today's the day
I'll catch
that walking carpet!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}What am I doing?
I'll tell you and
only you... {NextPage_49}
Due to an unforeseen
accident, my last
plan failed. {NextPage_49}
But, today I will
definitely catch
the beast. {35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This time I selected
my bait with care. {NextPage_49}
According to my
findings, he likes
raw food. {NextPage_49}
He seems to only
respond to fish
and vegetables... {NextPage_49}
He's so picky...
In any case! {32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
This time my plan
as a 120% chance
of succeeding!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}{50_19_0_3}I'll bait him with
his favorite food,
lure him back to {NextPage_1}my lab, and then
zap him good! {NextPage_49}
{50_19_0_0}This plan needs
a name! {32_2_188}{NextPage_49}
{34_1_101}{32_2_188}I'll call it
"Super Ultra Trap
Plan 2". {NextPage_49}{35_0}
----------x----------
Oh! Looks like I've
caught something! {32_2_188}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Look! {32_1_44}
It's perfect! {32_2_188}{NextPage_49}
{50_19_0_4}At last I have you! {32_2_188}
The white haired
beast is mine! {NextPage_49}
Mwa ha ha ha ha! {32_1_144}
{34_1_99}{32_5_220}I'm a genius!! {NextPage_49}
Whew...
Got a little carried
away there. {NextPage_49}
It took a months
worth of food
money for the {NextPage_1}project but it was
worth it! {NextPage_49}
I wonder what food
he'll take. {NextPage_49}
All I had setup
was rice and an
empty plate!? {35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_100}{32_5_220}I have to hurry and
put out the bait. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_4}W-w-what are you
doing!! {NextPage_49}
That took a months
worth of food money! {NextPage_49}
My foolproof plan!
You've just
spoiled everything! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, no! I didn't
prepare a spare
bait!{NextPage_49}
Now I don't have
enough to lure
him to the lab!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looks like it's
back to the drawing
board!! {NextPage_49}
Mmmmm...{32_1_144}
I was so close...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today's the day
I'll catch
that walking carpet! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}What am I doing?
I'll tell you and
only you... {NextPage_49}
Due to an unforeseen
accident, my last
plan failed. {NextPage_49}
But, today I will
definitely catch
the beast. {35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today I personally
picked out the
bait to use. {NextPage_49}
It was all very
high quality stuff. {NextPage_49}
This time I'll
get him for sure. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Look!
I've gotten so much
food, I can't fail. {NextPage_49}
They're all my
favorite foods. {NextPage_49}
Even if it fails,
at least I can
still eat! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This time I have a
150% chance of
success!! {NextPage_49}
----------x----------
{35_2}{50_19_0_3}I'll lure him back
to the lab using all
my favorite foods {NextPage_1}and then zap him
with an electric
shock! {NextPage_49}
{50_19_0_0}This plan needs
a name! {32_2_188}{NextPage_49}
{34_1_101}{32_2_188}I'll call it
"Super Ultra Trap
Plan 3". {NextPage_49}{35_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}{34_1_99}Look at it!
It's perfect! {32_2_188}
{50_19_0_4}Mwa ha ha ha! {NextPage_49}
I've finally got
you, you walking
carpet! {32_2_188}{NextPage_49}
Mwa ha ha ha!
I knew I was a
genius! {NextPage_49}
Whew...
Got a little carried
away there. {NextPage_49}
This time it took
3 months worth of
food money. {NextPage_49}
I don't even care
if I fail or not
this time! {NextPage_49}
Oh! I better hurry
and set the bait. {35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_4}W-w-what are you
doing!! {NextPage_49}
That was 3 months
worth of food money! {NextPage_49}
My foolproof plan!
You've just
spoiled everything! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}That's what you
expected me to
say, right? {35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Heh heh heh... {NextPage_49}
This time I laced
all the food with
sleeping medicine. {NextPage_49}
You've got to think
two steps ahead of
your enemy you know. {35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The sleeping
medicine should
take effect soon. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}...............
..................
.................. {NextPage_49}
..................
..................
.................. {NextPage_49}
...... {34_1_100} Wha? {32_5_220}
?????...???{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Why!!
Why isn't he
sleeping!? {NextPage_49}
Unless...
How can that be!? {35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_99}I must have bought
the wrong thing
by mistake! {NextPage_49}
I thought I put
sleeping pills, but
must have put my{NextPage_1}energy supplements
instead! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The game has gotten
interesting. {NextPage_49}
All the food is
gone... {NextPage_49}
All the supplements
are gone... {NextPage_49}
There's nothing
left!! {NextPage_49}
Looks like it's
back to the drawing
board again!! {NextPage_49}
My savings can't
endure much more... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}That rotten lousy
no good...! {NextPage_49}
Everyday he's
with Flora... {NextPage_49}
Grrrr... I won't
allow it! {NextPage_1}He's better off
back in the sea! {NextPage_49}
I hate his glasses! {NextPage_1}The way he walks
or the way he
talks!! {NextPage_49}
I'll make him a
test subject for
my cannon... {35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ha! Flora... {32_3_232}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}That barnacle!
He ate her cooking...{NextPage_49}
I'll never forgive
him, but I'm really
just jealous. {35_0}{32_5_220}
----------x----------
Oh no!
I've been seen!
Time to retreat! {32_5_220}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can change
energy but you
can't destroy it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
On the other hand
you need energy
to change the shape {NextPage_1}of any kind of
material component. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That may be...
But is that all?
Oh, hello {CharName_0}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey where are
you going? {NextPage_49}
I was going to talk
to you about my
latest experiment. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, why don't you
listening to me? {32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
This next experiment
could change the
world... {32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
It might even solve
the world's
energy crisis. {NextPage_49}
Depending on the
situation, I might
need you help... {NextPage_49}
Hey, come back! {32_1_244}
I wasn't done
talking yet... {32_1_244}{NextPage_49}
The night is young
and there's so much
to tell you... {32_7_208}
----------x----------
I can't believe it!
He understood so
much of my work. {NextPage_49}
I was going to treat
him to such good
food after the {NextPage_1}success of my
experiments. {NextPage_49}
I was really looking
forward to that
day... {NextPage_49}
You've ruined
my wonderful
plan! {NextPage_49}
{35_2}.........
.........
......... {NextPage_49}
This calls for one
of my clever plans... {NextPage_49}
If I could get some
DNA maybe I could...
Sniff sniff...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......{CharName_27},
could you play a
nice song for him? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was thinking of
going to bed... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to sleep,
why are you still
here? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Farewell...
Adios amigo! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey you.
I'm getting ready
to leave... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really need to get
going so... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So long... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Excuse me... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I fancy that
{29_0}.
How much?
{41_3_2}For you? {2a_1_5}G.
{2a_2_5}G.
Not for sale.
----------x----------
{50_19_0_3}Is that so!
That's a bargain...
I'll take it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay, I'll take it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, never mind
then. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want that
{29_0}.
How much?
{41_3_2}For you? {2a_1_5}G.
{2a_2_5}G.
Not for sale.
----------x----------
That's enough
for today. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm an energy
researcher. {NextPage_49}
Please come by my
lab sometime and
I'll show you one {NextPage_1}of my amazing
experiments. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can you go away
for now? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_3}{34_1_99}Ha ha ha!
That's my favorite!
Can I have it? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_3}I'll take it with
pleasure. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmph, I see. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_3}{34_1_99}You've got something
good, haven't you?
Can I have it? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
You've got something
good, haven't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't want that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I said I don't
want that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_4}Hey!
Didn't I tell you
I don't want it! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is this your son?
What an interesting
face he has. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What type of
responses will he
have... {NextPage_49}
What kind of
actions will he
do... {NextPage_49}
Oh, nothing.
Don't mind me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't really
like children... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I haven't done any
experiments with
dogs yet. {NextPage_49}
They seem to be
smarter than
cats though... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm very interested
in such a complex
living thing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's much we
don't know about
cats. {NextPage_49}
Maybe they act
without even
thinking... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There must be some
value in a cat
experiment. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Chickens eh? {NextPage_49}
I wouldn't mind
having one for
dinner. {NextPage_49}
I can't do that,
I already eat
bad as it is... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to make
a chicken that
could fly. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A chick eh?
I can't really eat
him for dinner. {NextPage_49}
He would take too
long to grow up. {NextPage_49}
----------x----------
I've heard some
chickens can lay
golden eggs. {NextPage_49}
I'd like to
experiment on
them. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ducks can't warm
their own eggs. {NextPage_49}
If you don't raise
them together with
chickens, their {NextPage_1}children will
never change. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is this a mini duck? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not too
interested in
using ducks as {NextPage_1}test subjects for
my experiments. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, you.
I don't really
like those things. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't have time to
run experiments
on those. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you going
do with that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cheese, eh? {NextPage_49}
I can't handle
milk but cheese
is okay I guess. {NextPage_49}
May I? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
Cheese is convenient
because you don't
have to cook it. {NextPage_49}
It would be great
to have around
the lab. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't just
eat butter by
itself, so thanks{NextPage_1}but no thanks,
my friend. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't want
butter. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I have that egg?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
There are living
eggs and just plain
eggs. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm curious about
fish. {NextPage_1}But not so much that
I'd touch one. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The fish around here
have some very
peculiar traits. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you cook this?
I'd like it. {40_0_0}
----------x----------
Can I have that? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
That's some good
looking food. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't even treat
process it for
anything... {NextPage_49}
I'm not interested
in it... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you researching
rocks? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A record, eh? {NextPage_49}
You've got some
unusual things,
don't you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's not a record
of you singing at
the farm, is it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}{50_19_0_9}Hmm...
It plays by itself.
Intriguing... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}What a strange
drum... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You. What are you
going to do with such
a huge bomb? {NextPage_49}
Don't plan on
bringing it to my
lab. {NextPage_49}
You'll have to set
that off outside... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Better be careful
with that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I live here so that
I can conduct my
experiments. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My main study is
living things and
energy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Someday I hope to
be able to make
clones. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer
in Mineral Town
is very rich. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer
in Mineral Town
is very popular. {NextPage_49}
I think he might
be very shady
myself... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Someone grew every
crop there is? {NextPage_49}
That's what I heard
from Mineral Town. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer
in Mineral Town
is a fishing genius. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer
in Mineral Town
walks a lot. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer
in Mineral Town
shirks all his {NextPage_1}farm duties and
spends all day
out fishing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer
in Mineral Town
has bad taste. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer
in Mineral Town owns
3 vacation houses. {NextPage_49}
Big deal...
I'm not impressed. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The food I got
last time was great.
Bring some more. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The cheese I had
last time was good.
Bring some more. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The cheese I had
last time stunk. {NextPage_49}
But I could see
myself getting
addicted to it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The cheese I had
before was great.
Can you get more? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you
gave me last time
was delicious. {NextPage_49}
I loved the way
it tasted. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The dish I had
last time was
wonderful. {NextPage_49}
I'd like to
eat it again. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've really been
working hard lately. {NextPage_49}
I've got to work
hard too... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Working hard?
Looks like you've
gotten better. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How's work on
the farm? {NextPage_49}
I'm still working
hard too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm doing energy
research now. {NextPage_49}
I'm trying to make
a system that can
use geothermal power.{NextPage_49}
That way there won't
be any more energy
problems. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you're curious,
you can come by
anytime. {NextPage_49}
Time it just right
and you'll get to
see my work. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't touch anything
while you're here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't walk around
here too much. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_4}I'm busy right now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please be quiet when
I'm doing an
experiment. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was just thinking
of something... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mumble mumble... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't think of
any good ideas...
Mumble mumble...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's gotten so
hot lately. {NextPage_49}
My head is dripping
with sweat. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just can't
make it work. {NextPage_49}
Oh, not you.
I was just talking
to myself. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think I've reached
the limits of my
own ability for now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's cold... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How can I keep the
heat from hot
seasons, and{NextPage_1}use it in cold
seasons...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm shivering from
head to toe...
My brain's fine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm at the most
important part
of the experiment. {NextPage_49}
I'm busy right now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Research never ends.{NextPage_49}
There's no time
to waste, that's
why I'm so busy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't touch anything
around there. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I said I was busy,
didn't I...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_9}I was just taking
a little walk... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cows have higher
body temperature
than humans. {NextPage_49}
They make more CO2
and thus contribute
to global warming {NextPage_1}whenever they either
burp or pass gas! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you know about
clone cows? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
I see.
No reason, I was
just asking. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's still much
research to be done.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm just taking a
walk, so never mind
me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm looking for
a test subject... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks like the
forest might have
test subjects. {NextPage_49}
Sometimes I like
to come out here
and search for some.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes I seen
a weird looking
living thing. {NextPage_49}
I haven't caught
it yet. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_9}I wasn't thinking
of anything... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Flo... I was just
talking to myself. {NextPage_49}
Can you leave me
alone for a bit? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Leave me alone
for a while. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Ha! ...Why?
Why am I here???
Whyyyyy??? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_9}I didn't have
any reason to see
Flora... {NextPage_49}
Uh, I mean it has
nothing to do
with Flora... {NextPage_49}
{50_19_0_3}I had to go see
Carter... {NextPage_49}
Yeah, that's it.
I came for Carter. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You want something
from me? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like to walk
around here
sometimes. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Research is still
necessary... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where did I make
a mistake... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really thought I
had it this time... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I still don't have
enough research...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought I finally
had a breakthrough...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know, every time
you're nearby,
my experiments fail. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I need to think
a little more... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, um...
I can't right now.
Maybe next time? {NextPage_0}
