{50_26_0_3}{CharName_1},
isn't it nice to have Mommy play with you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {2d}.{NextPage_49}
I thought maybe {CharName_1} should
take over {24_2}Farm.
How does that idea strike you?
{41_2_0}Definitely.
That's for {CharName_1} to decide.
----------x----------
Yeah.
{CharName_1} was born on a farm, after
all. That kid'll make a great farmer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, that's true. I guess I was
putting the cart before the horse, haha!
Growing up healthy is the most important.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, time for bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh yeah.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, there's not much
food left in refrigerator.
Could you put some more in?{NextPage_49}
Thanks babe. Night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} just went to bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
By the way...
{CharName_1} is watching a lot
of TV lately.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, you think that he'll be
interested in taking over the farm?{NextPage_49}
{CharName_1} was practically
riveted to that farm report.
What do you think?
{41_2_0}I bet you're right!
It's too early to tell.
----------x----------
Yeah.
I bet that kid'll be helping you out on
the farm in no time.{NextPage_49}
It will be cool to watch you two work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_26}I guess you're right.
But if you set a good example,
{CharName_1}'ll be sure to like farming.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
♪A necklace of♪
♪white flowers...♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
♪A necklace I got♪
♪from you...♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, Mommy'll be here
soon. Just wait a bit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, that was amazing!
You've gotta sing that for Mommy!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}!
{CharName_1}'s an amazing
singer!{NextPage_49}
That kid learned that song in no time.
I bet {CharName_1}'s got talent.
{41_2_0}I bet you're right!
It's too early to tell.
----------x----------
Yeah! That kid's got a real future!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Hmm...{32_3_232}
{50_26_0_26}I guess you're right.{NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_3}But if that kid can sing that well
with no training, I think we should try
to help out..{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Whatcha drawin'?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Mommy???{NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_25}Uh, that's real good...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} drew this.
What do you think it is?
{41_3_0}Flowers.
Me, of course.
Don't know.
----------x----------
Yes. Flowers...
Anyway, I think it's pretty good.
{50_26_0_3}I think that kid has talent.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Really?
If you say so, {2d}...{NextPage_1}{50_26_0_3}Hey, do you think {CharName_1}
could be some kind of genius?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmmm.
It looks like flowers to me.
But {CharName_1} says it's “Mommy.”{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But depending on how you think about it,
{CharName_1} might be have real talent.{NextPage_49}
Yeah...
I bet we just can't appreciate it.
{50_26_0_3}...Maybe even a genius...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Whatcha doin'?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}You're workin' hard, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey {2d},
{CharName_1} seems to be a pretty
good athlete. Don't you think?
{41_2_0}I don't know...
Of course.
----------x----------
I'm sure of it.
That kid loves running and jumping.
That kid will be a rich sports star...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sure. {CharName_1}'s your kid, after
all! {50_26_0_3}Anyway, we've gotta help out!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey {2d},
{CharName_1} sure likes books.{NextPage_49}
That kid's a regular bookworm.
You know, just the other day...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Hey {CharName_1},
you readin' a book?{NextPage_49}
What kind of book is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, what kind of book is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}I'm gonna go start up the bath.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey {CharName_1},
still reading?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}You like books, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} loves to study, I can tell.
I think that kid's gonna turn into some
kind of nerd. This didn't come from
my side of the family...
{41_2_0}I think so too.
It's too early to say.
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}That's what I was afraid of.
My kid, a nerd... Maybe a rich one.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Yeah, I guess you're right.
Any kid of mine is sure to be interested
in more important things...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, there's something I
want to ask you.{NextPage_49}
I don't want to cramp your style or
anything, but...{NextPage_49}
Have things been going well on the farm?
{CharName_7}'s worried because
you haven't been shipping much.
{41_2_0}I'm sorry. I'll try harder.
Who cares about this dumb old farm!
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Do you really mean that?
{41_2_0}No, I'll try harder.
Sure I do!
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}You're kidding, right?
{41_2_0}I'm kidding.
I'm serious!
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}You're serious?!
Don't you care what happens to the farm?
{41_2_0}Of course I do. I'll try harder.
Not really...
----------x----------
I'm glad that you said that.
I feel a little better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You scared me there.
But I guess I'm OK now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If we don't make this farm work,
I might have to get a job.
Oh Man! Try a little harder, please?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_30}But...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_30}B-But...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_30}.......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_7}...OK.
Whatever.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That was a pretty singing voice just now.
Was that {CharName_20}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That was really {CharName_1}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey {2d},
I wonder if {CharName_1} could have a
talent for music.{NextPage_49}
{CharName_20} said so.
I think our kid really likes music, too.
What do you think, {2d}?
{41_2_0}I think so too.
I don't think so.
----------x----------
I thought you'd say that.
I hope things work out for
{CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet our kid'll be playing to standing-
room only crowds!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?
Maybe I'm just being biased.{NextPage_49}
But our kid does have a great singing
voice. I think we have to be
supportive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And then our kid'll be playing to
standing-room only crowds!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if {CharName_1}
has any artistic sense...
Could our kid be an artist?{NextPage_49}
What do you think, {2d}?
{41_2_0}Sure.
It's too early to tell.
----------x----------
If {CharName_21} said so, it's
good enough for me.{NextPage_49}
I wonder what kind of artist.
Maybe a metal sculptor like Cody?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, that's true. It's too early to say.{NextPage_49}
But if our kid has an artistic sense
like {CharName_21} said, then I think
we have to be supportive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Woah, you scared me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well of course you can't beat {CharName_13},
he's a lot older than you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} is a really fast runner.{NextPage_49}
{CharName_11} said so.
Could our kid be an athlete?
{41_2_0}Maybe so.
Don't be silly.
----------x----------
{CharName_1} seems to like sports...
Maybe a gold medalist!{NextPage_49}
{CharName_13} would make a good
personal trainer, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe. But I've never seen a kid
{CharName_1}'s age run like that.{NextPage_49}
That kid seems to like sports. I think we
need to encourage that talent.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That professor guy said he wants
{CharName_1} to be his
assistant.{NextPage_49}
I guess that kid's pretty smart.
You don't think {CharName_1}
is a nerd, do you?
{41_2_0}Could be.
Come on, does he look like a nerd to you?
----------x----------
Uh-oh. Well, I guess there are
worse things than being a nerd.{NextPage_49}
Like not being able to coordinate your
socks and your shirts.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess so. {CharName_1}'s still a kid.{NextPage_49}
But if {CharName_1}'s interested in
something, I guess we should
try to be supportive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, I'm a little worried.
Is the everything going all right
with the farm?{NextPage_49}
This may be none of my business, but
how are things going, really?
{41_2_0}I'm sorry. I'll try harder.
I don't want to do farm work.
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}You can't mean that.
{41_2_0}Of course not. I'll try harder.
I'm serious!
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}You really mean that?
{41_2_0}No. I'll try harder.
Of course I do!
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}So you're really serious?!
You don't care what happens to the farm?!
{41_2_0}I'm sorry. I'll try harder.
No, not really...
----------x----------
I feel a better now that you've
said that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Man, you scared me.
But I feel better now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}That kid is growing up now,
and I'd like to remodel the house.
We're going to be OK, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_30}Wha-?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_30}B-But...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_30}........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_7}...OK fine.
Do what you like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Look, I understand what you're saying.{32_3_232}
----------x----------
But can't you listen to what we say
once in a while?{32_3_232}
----------x----------
Geez!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What book are you reading there?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wanna go for a walk?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why so serious?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Then why don't you just ask
your Mom?
I'm sure she'd be happy to show you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yeah, that's true.{32_3_232} I've got it.{NextPage_49}
I'll ask her for you. Then
you can ask her yourself when you
get the chance, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
It's about {CharName_1}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} seems really interested in
your work.{NextPage_49}
So if {CharName_1} and asks you, I'd
like you to take some time for your kid.
{41_2_0}Of course.
I'm too busy.
----------x----------
I knew you'd do it.{NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_3}You've got to teach that
kid as much about the farm
as you can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's why {CharName_1} didn't
want to ask you in the first place.{NextPage_49}
All right.
If you're really that busy, why not have
{CharName_1} help you?{52_0_0_0}
{39_48}{31}
Another one of my brilliant ideas!
That's OK, right? Huh? Hmm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
It's about {CharName_1}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think maybe {CharName_1} isn't very
interested in farm work. What do you say?
{41_2_0}Maybe not.
Of course my child's interested!
----------x----------
You think so too?
But if there's something else
{CharName_1} likes, that's fine too.{NextPage_49}
After all, {CharName_1}'s old man always
lived life his own way...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You think so?
If you say so, I guess maybe
it's true, but...{NextPage_49}
But if there's something else
{CharName_1} likes, that's fine too.{NextPage_49}
After all, {CharName_1}'s old man always
lived life his own way.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How've things been going recently?
The farm, I mean.
{41_2_0}It's going well.
Not great...
----------x----------
Really?{50_26_0_35}
Well, that's good.{NextPage_49}
It's just that {CharName_1}'s getting
bigger and all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm... What're we gonna do?
{50_26_0_9}{CharName_1}'s getting bigger every
day, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Music is nice, but you should help your
mother out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Art is nice, but you should help your
mother out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sports are nice, but you should help your
mother out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Studying is nice, but you should help your
mother out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know you like the farm, but you're
still young. You have to try doing lots
of things while you still can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey {2d}...
{50_26_0_9}{CharName_1} still hasn't come home.{NextPage_49}
It's getting so late.{NextPage_49}
Where could that kid be?
{41_2_0}I'll go looking.
{CharName_1} is an adult now.
----------x----------
Well, that's true.
But it's so late.
Couldn't you go out and have a look?
{41_2_0}Sure I'll go.
{CharName_1}'ll be back soon.
----------x----------
Thanks, babe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm. Listening to {CharName_27}'s guitar?
There's nothing wrong with music, but a
father worries if his kid is out late.{NextPage_49}
That kid certainly does like music.
Do we have a future musician on our hands?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm. If you say so...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey! {CharName_1}'s back!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where've you been?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, wait just a sec...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm. Listening to {CharName_27}'s guitar?
There's nothing wrong with music, but a
father worries if his kid is out late.{NextPage_49}
That kid certainly does like music.
Do we have a future musician on our hands?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I ask you something strange?
{41_2_0}No.
Sure.
----------x----------
Hey, what's with the cold shoulder?
Can't I just ask you a question?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well...
Do round things ever look square?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}???
Of course not.
----------x----------
You don't understand that either, do you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yeah, that's what I thought.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The thing is, {CharName_1}
asked me that out of the blue...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Say what?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you talking about?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm... I wonder.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So that's what happened.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if our kid might want to be an
artist... I think {CharName_1} is
pretty talented...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No problem...
What should I do?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Gotcha.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ready?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ready... Set... Go!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Go {CharName_1}!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Finished!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_13} is pretty fast, isn't he?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
{50_26_0_9}{CharName_1} still isn't home.{NextPage_49}
It's so late. Where
could that kid be!
{41_2_0}I'll go look.
{CharName_1} is an adult now.
----------x----------
Well, that's true.
But I'm still worried.
Could you go look?
{41_2_0}Alright, I'll go.
{CharName_1}'ll be back soon.
----------x----------
Thanks, babe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_19} seems to like {CharName_1}...{NextPage_49}
Being interested in {CharName_19}'s research
is fine, but staying out at all hours...{NextPage_49}
I hope my kid isn't turning into some
kind of mad scientist...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm. If you say so.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey! {CharName_1}'s back!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where've you been?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, just a second...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_19} seems to like {CharName_1}...{NextPage_49}
Being interested in {CharName_19}'s research
is fine, but staying out at all hours...{NextPage_49}
I hope my kid isn't turning into some
kind of mad scientist...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing there by yourself?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why?{NextPage_49}
I don't know the details, but it was
before you were born.{NextPage_49}
I think it was in the spring.
{CharName_7} and your mother came
here.{NextPage_49}
But {CharName_7} had been here before, with
some guy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I only asked {CharName_7} about
it once.{NextPage_49}
But that person was your mother's father.
That makes him your grandfather.
I guess.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't really know.{NextPage_49}
I never saw him again and
{CharName_7} won't tell me
any more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
She doesn't seem to want to talk about
it. She just says he's working on the farm
in honor of your grandfather's memory.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?
I'm sure your mother'd be happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What're you looking at?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you thinking about something...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's been a long time, hasn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}'s all grown up,
and we've both gotten older...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why, your hair's turned all white
and you're all wrinkly! Heheh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
{41_2_0}You're old too.
You're as handsome as ever.
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}Hey!{32_7_208}
{50_26_0_3}I guess neither of us is young anymore.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_10}Naturally. I'm...like...
a distinguished older gentleman, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But we still have work to do.
{CharName_7} still works so hard every day...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}... {2d}...
What's wrong?
{2d}! {CharName_0}!!{NextPage_49}
{CharName_1}! Call {CharName_31} here
right away!!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hang in there...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How is she?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How's business?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to help out, but I'm
not much of a salesman...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't sell things too cheaply.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Working hard is fine, but don't
go crazy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey {2d},
you shouldn't open your store
if you don't have anything to sell.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You sell out already?
Yep, you're workin' hard, I can tell.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you're all sold, out
let's go on home, Babe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time to close up shop for today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just came by to see how things were going.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you mean, I'm driving
away the customers?!
Well excuse me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't buy anything.
Haven't got any money.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are sales going well?
{41_3_1}Of course!
So so...
Terrible.
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Really?!
You must be a hot saleswoman!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I guess that's OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_7}Oh...
{50_26_0_0}But being persistent is the most important
thing in business. Don't give up.{NextPage_49}
At least that's what Dad always said.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is our livelihood.
Keep at it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd be glad to buy something from you,
but both our money comes from the same
place, so there's no point.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How's it going?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_7}I'm not feeling so great today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_7}I'm kinda depressed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_7}I'm feeling sort of down.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mornin'.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Aren't you going to bed?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing out so late?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, that looks great!
Can I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Leave it to my {2d} to
remember what my favorite foods are.
{50_26_0_3}Thanks!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Oh, I'm just supposed to look at it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hm?!
Can I eat that?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
That looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's one of my favorites. Why don't
you put some in the refrigerator?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a present for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Cool! Thanks.
{50_26_0_0}...Was today my birthday or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Oh...
You had me going there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hm?!
Could that be a present for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}All right! Thanks!
{50_26_0_0}Wait, is today our anniversary?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Oh...
I got all excited for nothing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Yay! Thanks.
{50_26_0_0}So, what holiday is this again?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you like that too?{NextPage_1}Just like me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You collect those?
Nice hobby.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_2}Hmm.
I'm not so keen on that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}If you asked me to eat that, I suppose I
could choke it down.{NextPage_49}
N-no,
I'm sorry, I just can't.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_2}I'll just come right out and say it.
I can't stand that.
I've hated it since I was a little boy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_2}You can show it to me all you want,
I won't eat it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
all... gross.
In other words, I don't like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_2}Just looking at that makes me feel
all... gross.
In other words, I don't like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}You like collecting things
like that?
Hmm... There's no accounting for taste.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi, {CharName_1}.
How's it goin'?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mommy's carryin' you, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's fine to take the kid with you, but
don't go too far away.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hiya, {23}.
Feelin' good?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard you can do some tricks.
What can you do, boy?
Go on, do it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Even this dog can learn tricks so I guess
we humans should learn some skills, too.
Good luck, {2d}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what kind of food {23}
likes. I bet if you fed him what he
likes, he'd like you better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}{23} seems to be avoiding me
these days.{NextPage_1}Or is it just my imagination?
{50_26_0_3}I guess he's just sensitive, like me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like cats. They're so free and honest.
I guess you could call it self-centered.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pretty cute.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cats are always so mysterious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that one of our chickens?
Lay lots of eggs for us, you
hear, chickie?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess these kinds of “chicks”
can be pretty cute, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Grow up big and strong you can
lay us lots of eggs!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope our chickens lay lots of
golden eggs.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ducks sure have funny faces.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A baby chicken is a chick, but what's
a baby duck called?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what a duck egg looks like.
Next time they lay one, show it to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder where this duck came
from, originally.
They didn't used to be here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Baby ducks are pretty cute,
aren't they?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of seed is that?
If you want to know about crops, you
should ask Vesta, Marlin or Celia.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Even if you give me something like that,
I can't do anything with it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
After you plant that seed and it grows
up, I wouldn't mind trying the results.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a crop from our farm, right?
{50_26_0_3}I guess it'll turn into some tasty
dish sooner or later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you going to do with that crop?{NextPage_49}
I bet if you gave it to Vesta, she'd
tell you what she thought of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you harvest a lot of those, we should
ship them and make a lot of money.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's not like I don't like milk, but
I really prefer cheese or butter.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom and Dad really like milk,
you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that cheese, huh?
Could I eat it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}All right. I'll give it a try.
I'm kind of picky about my cheese, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_2}Oh... Never mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you going to do with that cheese?
Could I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Thanks.
I love cheese.
Especially if it's good cheese.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's the milk that makes good cheese good.
So we've got to raise cows that give
good milk. Right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cheese sells for more than milk, so it's
better to concentrate on that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like butter.
But it's gotta be good butter,
or forget it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can use butter in cooking.{NextPage_1}And it sells for more than milk,
too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Making good butter can help put
{24_2}Farm on the map.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you think that egg would hatch if you
put it in the incubator.?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
An egg.
I think Mom used to make omelets
using an egg and butter.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't really like raw eggs.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Raw fish is so slimy and fishy
smelling. I can't stand it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You like fishing, {2d}?
I don't fish, but maybe {CharName_1} will
like to one of these days.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Some people eat raw fish, but I'm
not one of them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that one of those wild plants I've
heard about? Is it edible?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think I'll pass.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you cook it with something,
I might eat it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, that looks good.
Did you make it?
Could I eat it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Thanks.
I'll eat it later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_2}Oh... I see...
Well, never mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that dish for
me, {2d}?
I bet you did!
{41_2_1}You got it!
Close, but no free lunch.
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}I thought so.
Wow, thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your home cooking is pretty
good, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks good. If you want to know
anything about cooking, ask my Mom.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't think I'm cut out for any kind of
work where you have to use that.
{50_26_0_9}But I guess you knew that, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Something special about that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You use that to milk the cows, right?
Good luck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You use those to shear the sheep, right?
Don't try and use them on me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't use those to cut
{CharName_1}'s hair, do you?{NextPage_49}
No, of course not.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You like clippers?
Are you some kind of clipper freak?
Look, I'm not into that, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why are you showing me those?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}Hey, that's a pretty stone!
Is it a present for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Thanks.
But I guess it's a little too big to
make into a pendant.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh... Well you'd better not
give it to anybody else.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a handsome rock... “Handsome rock?”
I like the sound of that for some reason.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If it's a rare stone, maybe you could
sell it and make a lot of money.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that thing?
It's kind of interesting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...If you don't need that,
I'll take it off your hands...
{41_3_1}Give it to him.
Don't give it to him.
Sell it to him.
----------x----------
OK, I'll take it.
I wonder what I should do with it...
Maybe I'll sell it to Van.{NextPage_49}
Just kidding. I'll keep it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, take good care of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Uh, sell it to me?
What's up with that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks interesting.{NextPage_1}Van might pay pretty well
for something like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you pick some flowers?
But you can't eat them or use them
in cooking. What's it for?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that flower a present for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Thanks. I'll take it then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I see. Well, whatever.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those bloom all around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, that's a record, isn't it?
I have a song that I like, but
I guess this isn't it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you get more records, I'd like
to hear all kinds of songs.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Doesn't Van get his records from
Mineral Town?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You got that from Mom, right?
I think I saw it in the kitchen of the
Inner Inn.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
One of my favorite dishes is made with
that and mushrooms.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are some kinds of cooking that
you can't do without that spice.
Mom's really good at making them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}Interesting sound. Why don't you
bust out some funky beats for me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}Hmm... I like something with a
little better beat to it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_0}Hey, that's kind of pretty.
But I'd really rather have rings
or earrings.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet you could sell that for quite
a bit of money...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like jewels and accessories, but I'm not
interested in medals.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pretty necklace.
But I don't really think it's
your style.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've never seen a necklace like that.
Not really my taste, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks kind of like sheet music.
I wonder what instrument it's for.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know anything about that.
Maybe if you showed it to Gustafa.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's quite a firecracker.
Hey, when are you gonna set that
sucker off? That should be good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So those old twins made that
firecracker, huh?
Pretty impressive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A firecracker is really just a big lump of
gunpowder. Be careful with it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Something special about that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that, anyway...?
I'm not really interested...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Tim and Ruby are my parents.
{34_1_128}Everybody says that I don't really
look like either one of them.{NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_9}It's none of their business, but I guess
the apple fell far from the tree.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like farm life.
I used to goof off all the time, but I
was always planning something big.{NextPage_49}
Now that I have you and {CharName_1},
I really feel, you know, like a
grownup.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've kind of gotten interested in farm
work recently.{NextPage_49}
I can do more than just help you.
I want to come up with lots of ideas on
my own.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral Town
is really rich.
It doesn't bother me, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} from Mineral Town has
shipped every crop there is.
What about us?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard there's a mine in Mineral Town,
and that some gal just digs there all the
time. Can you make money like that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} from Mineral Town has
walked one million steps, I hear.
Riding a horse is a lot easier.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That {29_0} you gave me was
reeeeaaally good!
{29_0} is one of my favorites.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave me was really good.
There aren't many farms that can make
cheese like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that cheese you gave me from
goat's milk, right? It was a little
smelly, but also rich and delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave me was kinda unusual.
I've never had anything like that before.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave me was just
so-so.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter you gave me was really good.
There aren't many farms that can make
butter like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That {29_0} you gave me was
seasoned well.
You know just what I like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've been thinking, you're a really
great cook, {2d}.
And you know it's true if I say it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey {2d},
Have you gotten better at cooking lately?
I think your dishes are getting tastier.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey listen.
Don't you think that I've been doing
a good job at farm work lately?
{41_3_1}Sure I do.
No, I don't.
Job? What job?
----------x----------
You really think so?
That makes me feel really
happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you think so? I thought I was
working pretty hard, for me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Hmm. I guess I'll have to try harder.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Farm work is pretty tough,
isn't it?
But you're working hard, {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you found me.
It's OK once in a while, right?
Here, why don't you take a rest, too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, if you're here, does that mean
{CharName_1} is all alone?{NextPage_49}
Look, I'll be heading home pretty soon,
so why don't you go on back?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It can be nice to take a little break
after work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That white guitar that Griffin has
is pretty cool.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know, Takakura isn't really
the kind of guy I usually get along with.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You came from the city, right?
Doesn't this kind of life seem
boring to you?
{41_3_1}Not at all.
Sure it is.
It's better than the city.
----------x----------
Really? You're serious?
OK then...{NextPage_49}
Oh, it's just that I've lived in the
city and when I moved here I
thought I'd die from boredom at first.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought so.
I was that way too, at first.
But I like it now.{NextPage_49}
Now I feel like I can enjoy nature, and
I've met all kinds of nice people.
Especially you, {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yeah, I think I know what you mean.
There's a lot here that you just can't
get in the city.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I suppose {CharName_1}'s going to be
wanting a separate room sooner or later.
We'd better build one.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, what kind of TV programs
do you like?
I bet it's that one about dairy farming.{NextPage_49}
I like the music program, or maybe TV
shopping. And don't forget soap operas.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Living here, I feel like time
sort of passes really slowly.
You know what I mean?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Farm life is pretty fun.
Well, I guess that's because you're
working for the both of us.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I saw Takakura's notebook on the bookshelf
the other day. Takakura's a real pro
at farming, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not just sitting around watching
TV all day. I read books and
listen to music sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like this room pretty well.
It's simple and quiet. A perfect room
for taking a nice rest.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you ask me, this is the time
when we should be reading everything
about farming. Right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you ask me, this is the time
when we should be enjoying farm life
as much as we can. Understand?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to stay with you on the
farm forever.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just stopped by for a visit.
Do you have some business here, too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll be going home soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I sometimes get the urge to talk to other
people, so I like to stop by lots of
places and chat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is a perfect day for just wandering
around and doing nothing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}I feel like going partying!
{50_26_0_9}Er, after my work is done,
of course.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love this time of year. I'd like to take
{CharName_1} to look at the flowers.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You seem to be running all the time.
Don't you get tired?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, where are you off to?
{41_3_1}Just down the way...
Oh, nowhere...
None of your business.
----------x----------
{50_26_0_2}That's kind of vague...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_2}You're just wandering around?{NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_3}Just like me, then.
Ha ha ha!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_7}Woah, that's kind of cold.
And what's that supposed to mean, anyway?{NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_0}Well, never mind.
I won't let under my skin.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The beach is the best place at this time
of year. I may not look it, but I'm
a quite a surfer.{NextPage_49}
Seriously. Even now when
I see a killer wave, I get all
excited.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everybody says it's so hot at this
time of year, but I'm fine.
I can't stand the cold, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I'm taking a walk like this, I
always start to feel romantic.
I guess it's that kind of season, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
By the way, Mom was saying that you
can collect all kinds of tasty wild
plants at this time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you seen that weird guy sitting
underneath the tree?
I wonder what his story is...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Some tasty mushrooms grow near
Vesta's farm, you know.
I wish I had some Mushroom Gratin.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I suppose Wally and his kid are out
jogging, even in this cold.
I can't believe it{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_2}Well anyway,
try not to catch cold.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't believe that guy sitting under
the tree doesn't catch cold like that.
Man.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
At this time of year there's always a
white abominable snowman-lookin' guy in
the forest. I like him though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When there's nothing in the fridge I feel
kinda depressed, so try and keep it
stocked, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes I feel like cooking myself.
What do you think?
{41_3_1}Why not?
Maybe not...
You're gonna hurt yourself.
----------x----------
Yeah... But I guess I'll forget about
it for now. I don't want to show you
up or anything...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you say so.
I'll just forget about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_2}Very funny...
Maybe I'll just go ahead and cook
when you're not looking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If I cooked something, would you eat it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Really?
Thanks. Just hearing you say that
is enough for me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_2}Oh...
Then I'll just make it for me
and {CharName_1}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm kind of a gourmet, so I'm
a little picky about food.{NextPage_49}
But the food you make is always
great, {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just remember this:
I can't stand Tempura.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what {CharName_1} wants
to be in the future.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We should probably avoid going
into {CharName_1}'s room for
a while.{NextPage_49}
But it's just a phase.
I'm sure of it.
I remember being like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Even though it's all part of the same
house, I feel a little nervous
going into {CharName_1}'s room.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you seen {CharName_1}'s diary?
I found it on the bookshelf the other
day and had a little peek.{NextPage_49}
It's pretty interesting.
But don't let {CharName_1} catch you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you look at a kid's room, you can
tell what they're interested in.
Are you cleaning up here, {2d}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I'm in {CharName_1}'s room,
I remember back when I was a kid.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I'm in this room,
I remember back when I was a kid.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Any good reads around here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, I read more than just
comic books, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Zzzz... Zzz...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yaaawn...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm kind of sick of TV.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I suppose I don't have any right to say
this, but is the farm making any money?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Working in the fields is pretty tough.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I kind of like playing in the dirt,
but I don't think I'm cut out
for raising crops and stuff...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I look out over the fields here,
I feel kinda like I'm working.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love seeing the grass roll like
that in the wind...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I'm checking the growth of the grass
like this, I feel kinda like I'm working.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
..........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
..........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
..........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
..........{NextPage_0}

----------x----------

----------x----------
..........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?
But I guess I should pass for now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where are you going in this weather?
Of course I'm out walking in
the rain, too, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't think our roof leaks, do you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's so much to see and do
on a farm. It's a lot of fun.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Takakura can buy whatever we need
for the farm when he goes to the
city, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought maybe I could help
you with something.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like animals, but I don't really
like taking care of them...
Is that bad?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, would you like to have a
turtle on the farm? I saw a really
big one in the swamp...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I went to visit Mom and Dad.
They seem to be doing fine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh yeah!
We've got to have a milk
drinking contest.{NextPage_49}
Come on, {2d}.
What do you say?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
All right. Let's go!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh...
Well, maybe next time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whenever I come here, I remember
Mom's home cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wally was the one that started the
milk drink contests.
He's so competitive.{NextPage_0}
