..........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_105}I just don't like the
shape of this... So I have to...
fix it, like this...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_106}There, that's not a bad shape....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, your mother is here for you.
I guess it's time to be going.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your son has an artistic sense.
Not everyone is so sensitive
to shapes...{NextPage_49}
That kind of talent has to be nurtured.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Death is a part of life...{32_7_208}
But for those of us still living,{32_7_208}
it can be hard to lose those we love.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, would you sing something
for our friend....?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_106}Oh, it's you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You came just at the right time.
I made something for you to put in
your room.{NextPage_1}Are your rooms pretty big?{32_3_232}
{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Then it should be OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought so, so I made it small.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought I'd bring it over to you
now...{32_3_232}
{41_2_0}OK then.
Could you wait a bit?
----------x----------
Well, let's go...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can't wait.{32_3_232}
Let's go...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Which room do you want it in?{32_3_232}
{41_2_0}{2b_16}
{2b_18}
----------x----------
All right then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All right then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's perfect here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}Not bad, eh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I guess I'll be heading back.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to be going to bed soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's my bedtime.
Could you be moving along?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, see you later.
Goodnight.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to be going out in a bit...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm leaving now.
Could you leave?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See you later...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Uh, excuse me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_105}Nothing to sell, I see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess there's no point in shopping then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't you have anything to sell?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm just having a look around.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't seem to have much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like the {29_0},
but how much is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
All right then, I'll take it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, all right.
I'll take it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh.
OK then...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How much is the {29_0}?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
I guess I'll pass for today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm an artist. I make iron sculptures.
Nice to meet you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you're the one working the farm, eh?
{CharName_128}, right? Nice to meet you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_106}What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
..........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing out so late?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_107}Oh, is that for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}Arigato.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_107}That looks pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't like that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't need that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_106}What's that??{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}Cute kid...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He has a cute face.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He looks a little wild.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}Cute kid...
Looks talented.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can tell that this child
has unlimited potential.
Don't waste it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey doggie. How's it goin'?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take good care of him.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cute kitty...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't think it likes being held.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't like chickens.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute chick.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cute, but...
Not for me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't think it likes being held.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Interesting face.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...I wonder what it's thinking...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of seed could that be?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't planting seeds your
job?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you grow that?
Mother Earth has blessed you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}...Could I have that?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}Really? Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_105}I see....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's good to grow living
things...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Fresh milk is great.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Fresh milk tastes great.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that cheese on your farm?
It looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good cheese is rich and delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that butter on your farm?
It looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good butter has a distinctive smell.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't drop that...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you catch that fish yourself?
Not bad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a good looking fish.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The wild plants around here are tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_106}Why don't you try eating that yourself?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that dish?
It looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That dish looks quite good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an odd hoe.
It looks pretty heavy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've never seen a hoe like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe certainly is old, isn't it?
Can you use it properly?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...That hoe sure is dirty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe looks brand new.
You've got to break it in...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You haven't used that hoe much, have you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The more you use a hoe, the better it is.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where are you headed with that hoe?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that your hoe?
It looks like you've used it a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe looks easy to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an unusual sickle.
It looks kind of hard to use...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a strange looking sickle...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That sickle looks really sharp.
You can't go waving that around here.{NextPage_48}
----------x----------
What an odd sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that your sickle?
You've got to break it in more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty new sickle there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The more you use a sickle, the better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't just walk around with that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that your sickle?
Pretty old, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That sickle's been used a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?
A piece of art that you made?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It has a nice shape to it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't need a watering can.
Do I look like I'm a
gardener?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you planning to water me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_105}What an odd device.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't like that shape much
at all...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My mom used to use those on me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_4}Don't get those near
my head!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are some big clippers you've got.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_106}What is that anyway?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I try not to use too many tools when I'm
creating my art...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an unusual stone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pretty stone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's pretty strange looking...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you going to do with that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've heard that the wild plants that grow
around here have strange properties.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You picked that around here, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, is that a record?
Do you have a collection or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love music.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Smells strong.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}{34_1_107}What an odd looking drum.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}{50_21_0_3}Not a bad sound, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an unusual necklace.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty necklace.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The old guys over there made that, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where do you set off something like that?
----------x----------
Don't drop that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've been to a lot of places, but
I feel the most comfortable here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't talk much, but don't
worry about it.
I'm just not much of a conversationalist.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love it when one of my creations blends
in perfectly with the environment...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral Town
is really rich...
Not that I care...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear the farmer in Mineral Town
is very popular, but she probably
just gossips a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
To raise animals and also grow all
of the crops... Oh, I'm talking about the
farmer in Mineral Town.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That farmer in Mineral Town is a nice gal.
I heard that she takes very good care
of his animals.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear that the farmer in Mineral Town
digs lots of holes in the mountains.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral Town
is a great fisherman...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer in Mineral Town walks
a lot, I hear.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That farmer in Mineral Town certainly is
old. She's been farming for 50 years.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral Town
ignores her farm and spends all
her time fishing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral Town
has really bad taste.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what the farmer in Mineral Town
gets out of building so many houses?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It seems there's a blacksmith in Mineral
Town that can make some amazing tools.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}That thing you gave me a while ago
was really good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry to say this after you were so
nice to give it to me, but that thing
you gave me wasn't very good...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me was
delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me was
really delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}The {29_0} you gave me
was the best!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}The {29_0} you gave me
was just the kind I like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}The cheese you gave me
was really good. Very rich...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese was kind of smelly.
But I like that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave me
was pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}That butter you gave me was
really good. Very rich...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter was kind of smelly.
But I like that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter you gave me
was pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}The {29_0} you gave me
was amazingly good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That dish you gave me was
pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That fish you caught was
delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The wild plants you picked for me
were delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The wild plants you picked for me
were delicious..{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That thing you gave me was good.
I think.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're sure working hard lately.
I can see it on your face.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're sure working hard lately.
You have a dignified air about you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You seem to be used to your work.
You appear more relaxed now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you think of my artwork?
{41_3_1}It's pretty.
I guess I like it.
I'm not sure.
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}{34_1_105}Really?
I thought maybe I was the only person who
thought this kind of thing was pretty...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}Well... It's nice of you
to say that, anyway.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_105}I suppose not.
I think maybe the tastes
are different between us.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not very good with people,
but don't worry.
That's just who I am.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The nature around here goes well with my
artwork.
Or is it the opposite?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}I feel good today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How're you doing? Hmm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_106}What's up?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you need something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_105}I feel good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_105}...I feel good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm busy thinking about my
artwork right now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_105}No, I don't like it.
Something's not right.
I can't quite put my finger on it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got to feel to live.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I get so many images and feelings
just from living here, but I'm still not
able to express them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_105}I feel like I'm missing out
on something important...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_106}How are you feeling?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You have to feel something about the
things you see and hear...
...do you understand what I mean?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nature changes along with the
seasons, but my artwork never changes...
...that'll never do.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess it just takes more time.
Yes........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, welcome.
Make yourself at home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I make a piece of artwork, I
try to work my feelings into
the material I'm working with.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I still don't get a feeling of
“nature” from this piece.
Still needs more work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The ocean consumes all.
Even human emotions are absorbed
by the sea...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A calm ocean is nice, but a rough
one is even better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The flow of a river never stops.
You may forget time looking at a river,
but like the river, time never stops.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_105}If you stare long into a river...
Your eyes see everything in motion...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Even though I've got such a small house,
these guys sure come over a lot...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_105}Don't touch those iron plates...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}{34_1_105}...It's lively here today...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This waterfall gives me energy.
I can feel the immense power of the water.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I never get tired of this place,
no matter how many times I come.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...
But I think I'll have to pass for now.
Maybe next time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I found something strange on the beach...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Would you like to try using it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK, here you go...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope you can use it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.........................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.................Nami........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I...{32_3_132} don't...{32_3_32} lie...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nami... You wanted to talk to me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh...
I thought there was a store here...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What did I want to buy?
Hmm... Well, toys or maybe some
things from the dig site...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When it rains, my artwork rusts.
That's a part of my art, too...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's part of the evolution of my oeuvre.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's what so interesting about iron.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...............{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't believe in making lots of artwork.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
First I have to perfect the ones
I am working on...{NextPage_0}
