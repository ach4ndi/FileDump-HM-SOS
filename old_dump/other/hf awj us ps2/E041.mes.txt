Oh{u_0086}{2d} hello.
My name's {12}Gray{17}.{NextPage_49}
Nice to meet you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you're fishing?{NextPage_49}
Have you heard of 
{12}Mineral Town{17}?{NextPage_49}
The owner of the farm there
liked fishing a lot{u_0086}{2d} too...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm here as a part of my training.{NextPage_49}
I'm trying to find myself{u_0086}{2d} so
I can restart my blacksmithing
training...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess fishing helps focus
your mind{u_0086}{2d} huh?{NextPage_49}
Blacksmith training does the
same thing.{NextPage_49}
You can't have too much or
too little tension in your
shoulders.{NextPage_49}
Getting the right balance
is really hard.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure it'll be difficult for us
both{u_0086}{2d} but we have to do our best!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If I was a pro blacksmith{u_0086}{2d}
I could make some better tools
for you{u_0086}{2d} but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well{u_0086}{2d} nice meeting you.â™ª{NextPage_0}
