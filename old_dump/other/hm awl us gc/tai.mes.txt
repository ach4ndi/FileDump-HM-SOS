Good job, you two.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh! Hi, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you saw it,
did you?
I'm so embarrassed! {NextPage_49}
That's a picture
from a trip I took
down south years ago.{NextPage_49}
I was so young
then... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come to think of it,
there's something I
received on that{NextPage_1}trip... {NextPage_49}
If you want, take it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't use it at
all, so please
accept it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See you later. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
In that case... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi, {CharName_0}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you see {CharName_4},
will you tell her we
are looking for her?{NextPage_49}
She left some money
and disappeared.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_4} left some
money and then
disappeared...!{NextPage_49}
I wonder if she'll
come back? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi, {CharName_0}.
So you didn't find
her, did you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Umm... {CharName_4}...
Was the money you
left in your room{NextPage_1}payment? Are you
leaving us...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm so glad.
Thank goodness!{NextPage_49}
Hey Ruby, get the
dinner ready.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_4}, your dad
called last night. {NextPage_49}
I asked if he wanted
to talk to you, but
he said no and just {NextPage_1}hung up! {NextPage_49}
I hope everything's
all right... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh yeah, this letter
arrived for you,
{CharName_4}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Huh? What happened
all the sudden? {NextPage_49}
Well, it's alright.
There must be some
reasons...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {CharName_4}...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please take care of
{CharName_4} for me.{NextPage_49}
She is like my
Precious daughter. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take care of
yourself. It was nice
to have you here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Of course. I tell
everyone that {CharName_4}
is our daughter.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is {CharName_0} here? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry for coming so
early. I have
something to ask.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You see, {CharName_0},
{CharName_4} is planning
on leaving today.{NextPage_49}
What do you think? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, I heard
you proposed to
{CharName_4}. {NextPage_49}
She sounded like she
regretted turning
you down. {NextPage_49}
Do you still feel
the same way?
{41_2_0}Propose.
Stay single.
----------x----------
Well if it isn't a
Blue Feather! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've never seen one,
they're so rare!
How did you find it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank goodness.
I have to go tell
Ruby... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yeah, I figured.
Okay, let's go.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You mean you really
don't want to marry
anyone at all? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_4} is planning
on leaving here
today. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_4}... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to have
{CharName_4} stay with
us forever.{NextPage_49}
We can't afford that,
though, so we thought
to ask you. {NextPage_49}
{CharName_4} likes you,
after all. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I knew it.
{41_2_0}Live together.
Stay single.
----------x----------
Isn't that great,
{CharName_4}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you really like
being alone, do you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, I heard
you proposed to
{CharName_4}. {NextPage_49}
She sounded like she
regretted turning
you down,{NextPage_49}
so I brought her
with me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I help you?
{41_2_0}Came to see {CharName_4}.
Came to see you.
----------x----------
That's great!
{CharName_4} doesn't seem
so happy lately. {NextPage_49}
Can you please cheer
her up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey {CharName_4}...{32_3_32}
----------x----------
Oh, she's gone...
{CharName_0}, please
take care of {CharName_4}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_4}, cheer up!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You want to talk
to me?{NextPage_49}
Actually, I'm pretty
worried about {CharName_4}
these days... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_4} does seem
melancholy these
days... {NextPage_49}
{CharName_0}, won't you
cheer her up for me? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't feel
so well... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So...hungry... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_2}What's all the
fuss about...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}Hmm? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Welcome back, {CharName_4}.
I'm so glad you're
here! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}{CharName_25} will be
so happy! {NextPage_49}
{50_24_0_0}Your room is
just as you left it.{NextPage_49}
{50_24_0_3}This is your home,
remember! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm glad you came,
{CharName_0}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_4} left money
and disappeared! {NextPage_49}
I hope she isn't gone
for good. {NextPage_49}
Will you tell her to
come back if you
see her? Please? {NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Okay.
I'll look for her.
----------x----------
Sorry to come so
early, {CharName_0}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really? Thanks! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
In that case, will
you look for {CharName_4}
for us? {NextPage_49}
We'll look too,
of course. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you find
her, {CharName_0}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you didn't find
her? I hope she
didn't leave forever!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It was so early for
you to go, {CharName_0}...{32_7_208}
We'll take care of
{CharName_1} for you.{NextPage_49}
Rest in peace. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, will you
sing something for
{CharName_0}'s spirit? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to bed now,
so... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time for me to
go to bed, so you'll
have to leave. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm getting sleepy
now, so... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to go on an
errand, so... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See you later. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Excuse me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Excuse me, {CharName_0}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}I guess everything
is sold out now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll come back
some other time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought you might
have good ingredients
for my cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't worry about it.
I'm just looking. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Umm, seems like you
don' have good
ingredients today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if there is
something else I
could buy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}...Huh?
{34_1_117}Is this...? Mmm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm...I guess not.
Sorry for troubling
you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello, {CharName_0}.
How are you enjoying
Forget-Me-Not Valley?{NextPage_49}
As for me...I was on
a worldwide journey,
then somehow ended {NextPage_1}up here and running
an Inn! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}...Ahh...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}Oh...Sory...
Umm... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_4}.........! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good morning. I hope
it shapes up to be
a great day! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good morning. I hope
it shapes up to be
a great day! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good day to you.
How goes work on the
farm? {NextPage_49}
Me? I'm doing fine,
I guess. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good evening. How
the day flies when
you're busy! {NextPage_49}
I'm not usually busy,
but sometimes it
gets that way. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're here awfully
late, {CharName_0}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's awfully late,
{CharName_0}. Do you
want to stay over? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks for coming,
{CharName_0}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're here awfully
late. What a
coincidence! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a coincidence
to meet you here,
{CharName_0}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You mean you're
giving that to me?
I love those! {40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Thank you so much!
I can't believe
your generosity! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}That's too bad,
but I understand... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've been all over
the world, but this
is my favorite! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My stomach grumbles
just by looking at
that! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please come stay at
my Inn! My wife makes
delicious food! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I pick all the
ingredients for our
food, you know. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}You certainly
have good taste! {NextPage_49}
I should know
been around! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}I really love
that! You've found my
weak spot! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}I'm not very picky,
but I really can't
eat that... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}Sorry, but I
really can't stomach
that particular dish.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}I'm not very picky,
but I really can't...
I'm terribly sorry. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}Sorry, but I
really don't like
that dish... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}Sorry, but I
just can't eat that
at all. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}He's so cute!
He looks like Celia,
doesn't he? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Our Rock used to be
this cute, long
ago... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}He's so cute!
He looks like Muffy,
doesn't he? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Our Rock used to be
this cute, long
ago... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you come and stay
at our Inn, we'll
give him some of {NextPage_1}our famous
baby food! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}This quite little guy
takes after Nami,
doesn't he? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your baby seems so
content. Quite unlike
how our Rock was! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}This little
doggy looks pretty
smart! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}Actually...I'm
quite terrified of
dogs... {NextPage_49}
Please don't bring
it any closer...! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}I know someone my
size shouldn't be
scared of dogs...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}What a cute little
kitty! She's
adorable! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}I've been all
over the world, and
I've loved all the {NextPage_1}cats I've met! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}I guess cats
are just universally
cute! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Is this chicken
from your farm?
It looks delicious! {NextPage_49}
I mean...I bet it
lays good eggs. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If it does lay good
eggs, please sell
some to us. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}This duck looks
quite tasty!I mean...
it's very cute... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
On my travels I saw
a dish with whole
roasted duck, {NextPage_1}but I it was too
expensive for me,
unfortunately... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That seed look
like good stock. {NextPage_49}
We grow crops in
back, so I should
know. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do a good job of
growing the crops and
then sell them to us!{NextPage_49}
For a good price,
of course... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Did you grow
this? It looks tasty
indeed! {NextPage_49}
Can I have some?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
Mmmm...
It IS very good!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We use all kinds
of crops to make a
variety filled menu.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_3}Is this milk
from your farm?
It looks very fresh. {NextPage_49}
Can I try some,
please?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
Milk is very good for
you, you know. Ruby
will be happy too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk looks
so fresh! Bet it
tastes great... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_3}Is this cheese
from your farm?
It looks delicious. {NextPage_49}
Can I try some,
please?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
This is magnificent
cheese! I've traveled
the world over and {NextPage_1}eaten everywhere,
so I should know! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese looks
excellent. I bet the
milk is good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd love to serve
that cheese at the
Inn! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd love to give that
delicious-looking
cheese to Ruby! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_3}Did you make
that butter?
It looks great! {NextPage_49}
Can I try some,
please?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
That butter looks so
good, I'd love to
use it for cooking {NextPage_1}at the Inn. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Butter makes food
taste so good,
especially when my {NextPage_49}
Ruby makes it! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can really have
that butter? I'll
use it at the Inn! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that egg from one
of your chickens?{NextPage_49}
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_3}It looks so
nice and fresh.{NextPage_49}
Can I have it...
please?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
I've eaten egg dishes
all over the world
and liked them all! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ruby's best egg dish
is...fried egg! {NextPage_49}
What, you say
anybody can make
that? {NextPage_49}
No, Ruby's is
special! Come to the
Inn one morning and {NextPage_1}find out! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know an egg dish
called "Katsu-don"? {NextPage_49}
Deep fried pork and
eggs over rice...
Yummy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you catch that
fish?
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_3}It looks so
delicious!{NextPage_49}
Will you give it to
me...please?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
I can't gut fish,
of course, but my
Ruby's a pro. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everyone will be so
happy if we served
this at the Inn! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That fish sure does
look good. How shall
Ruby cook it... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you gather those
wild plants around
here? {NextPage_49}
Can you use them
to cook? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Some wild plants are
poisonous, so you
have to be careful! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Most of the plants
around here are okay,
but on my travels... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks good...
I think. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_3}That looks
delicious. I'm a
tough critic.{NextPage_49}
Can I try it?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
The most important
part of cooking is
selecting{NextPage_1}ingredients. I do
that at the Inn. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}My Ruby is a
great cook, but this
is just as good! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That looks like
a pretty nice hoe
you have there. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going to work
in the fields?
What tough work!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear farm tools
get better the more
you use them. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That's a nice
sickle you have
there... {NextPage_49}
I'm actually a
little jealous. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}All I ask is
that you be a little
careful about {NextPage_1}where you swing
that thing! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That's a nice
watering can you have
there... {NextPage_49}
I'm actually a
little jealous. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's built a little
oddly, but is it
easy to use? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an odd watering
can you have! I bet
it's quite rare. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you get it from
somebody? I could
swear I've seen it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that watering can
new? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That watering can
looks pretty well
worn in. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}I hope you
aren't going to water
around here...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}I can tell you've
given that watering
can a lot of use. {NextPage_49}
Good work! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That's got to be
the oldest watering
can I've ever seen! {NextPage_49}
Must be a joy to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a milker?
Must make milking
convenient. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Fresh milk is the
best for you.
I'm jealous! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}But, I don't think
there are any cows
around these parts...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are wool
clippers for shearing
sheep, right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've seen wool used
all over the world.
It's warm, you know. {NextPage_49}
----------x----------
You don't see manual
clippers very much
anymore... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those new clippers
are for shearing
sheep, right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you been getting
the hang of those
clippers recently? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}I've always loved
sheep, you know. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Looks like you've
worn those clippers
in pretty well! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It takes a while to
break in new tools,
but it's worth it! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I always love the way
a new tool smells... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Tools become more
efficient the more
you use them. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The more you use a
tool, the more
efficient it gets. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_3}Now this tool
looks like it's been
around! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Looking at a
worn-in tool like
this always makes {NextPage_1}me feel like
working hard myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_12}Is that a
rare stone? I haven't
seen it before. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_12}I don't know
anything about these.
Sorry... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_3}I'm not sure
what this is, but it
looks impressive! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Would you be willing
to part with it,
by any chance? {40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Thanks so much.
I'll treasure it. {NextPage_49}
I think maybe I'll
keep it in the Inn...{NextPage_49}
If Ruby doesn't mind,
that is... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_7}That's too bad,
but I understand. {NextPage_49}
Ruby wouldn't have
let me keep it in
the Inn, anyway. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you gather those
grasses around here? {NextPage_49}
They'd be good in
a salad, I warrant. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can definitely
eat them, though. {NextPage_49}
Some wild plants
around here have
mysterious effects.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}Are they any good?
Not unless you have
really odd tastes... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Some wild plants
help you reenergize.{NextPage_49}
How do they taste?
It's a surprise.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_3}That's a record,
isn't it? How unusual
to find around here!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of record
is it? I'm quite the
aficionado, myself. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I listened to records
all the time when I
lived in the city, {NextPage_1}but that was long
ago... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ruby and I even have
a special song! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_3}What a rare spice
you have. Where did
you get it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd love for Ruby to
make something
special with that...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}I wonder what Ruby
would use it for?
I bet it'd be great!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_66}{32_5_220}{34_1_117}What a strange
sound... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've heard
instruments from all
over the world, {NextPage_1}but none like that! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117} {50_24_0_12}Hmm...
This is a truly rare
drum. {NextPage_49}
Where did you
find it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_3}What a gorgeous
medal, this is! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you win it at
some tournament? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I won a medal at a
world championship
once, you know. {NextPage_49}
What, you don't
believe me...? {NextPage_49}
It was an eating
competition, but it
still counts! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}Hmmm...I think I've
seen this medal
someplace before...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_12}Hmm...What an
unusual necklace
this is! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've seen strange
necklaces from all
around the world, {NextPage_1}including ones with
human bones! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}I'm not so
interested in that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_12}I'm not sure,
but I think that's a
music sheet. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't read it, but
I know what it is. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can you play this
piece for me? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_12}Are those
fireworks? {NextPage_49}
I bet they really
light up the sky! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Some festivals use
hundreds of those,
you know. {NextPage_49}
I saw a beautiful
show once in a
country far away... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Call me when you
light that one! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A present, for me?
Thanks, but I
couldn't accept it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No, really, I can't.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_12}If you're going to
give it to somebody
else, why show it {NextPage_1}to me? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a present for
someone else, right?
Why show it to me? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_117}{50_24_0_12}Sometimes, I wonder
if I'm really cut out
to run an Inn... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}I was originally on a
voyage around the
world, but then I {NextPage_1}found Forget-Me-Not
Valley and fell in
love with it.{NextPage_49}
Then I started
putting up friends,
and that turned into{NextPage_1}a full-time job! {NextPage_49}
I'm still not sure if
it's right for me,
though... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have knick-knacks
I've gathered from
all over the world {NextPage_1}at my Inn.
I love them! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That dish you gave me
the other day was
truly exceptional! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_7}I hate to have to
say this, but...
remember{NextPage_49}
what you gave me
to eat the other day?
I really didn't like{NextPage_1}it, so don't give me
any more, OK...?{NextPage_49}
Sorry... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}The {29_0}
you gave me the other
day was okay, but... {NextPage_49}
I can't help thinking
it should have been
a little better. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}The {29_0}
you gave me to eat
was pretty good! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}The {29_0}
you gave me was
the best I've ever {NextPage_1}had, and I've eaten
it all over the
world! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}The {29_0}
you gave me the other
day was just superb! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Thanks for the
milk the other day.
It was delicious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}That milk you gave
me the other day... {NextPage_49}
It was a little,
um...Oh, never mind. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}That milk you gave
me the other day...
It was kind of...{NextPage_49}
Um...Oh, never mind!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That milk you gave
me the other day...
It was pretty good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}The milk you
gave me was some of
the best ever! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}Remember that milk
you gave me...? {NextPage_49}
Umm...Maybe it would
be better as cheese?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}Remember that milk
you gave me...? {NextPage_49}
May I suggest it may
be better as cheese? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That milk you gave
me the other day was
pretty good! {NextPage_49}
It might be even
better as cheese,
though. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That milk you gave
me the other day was
excellent! {NextPage_49}
It might be even
better as cheese,
though. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}The milk you were
nice enough to give
me was great, but... {NextPage_49}
It was a little thin,
I'm sorry to say. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That milk you
gave me really hit
the spot. Thanks. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That milk you
gave me was really
rich. Thanks. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That milk you
gave me was truly
delicious. Thanks. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}Remember that milk
you gave me...? {NextPage_49}
Umm...Maybe it would
be better as butter? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}Remember that milk
you gave me...? {NextPage_49}
May I suggest it may
be better as butter? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That milk you gave
me the other day was
pretty good! {NextPage_49}
It might be even
better as butter,
though. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}The milk you were
nice enough to give
me was great, but... {NextPage_49}
It was a little
thick, I'm sorry to
say. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}That milk you gave
me? It was a little
strong... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave
me... It was good but
a little strong. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}The cheese you gave
me was nice and
tasty! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}The cheese you gave
me was a little
pungent, but good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}The cheese you gave
me was a rare treat.
Thanks very much. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make the
cheese you gave me
the other day? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}The butter you gave
me the other day was
very good. Thanks. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}The butter you gave
me the other day
smelled a little {NextPage_1}odd, but it was
good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}The cheese you gave
me was a rare treat.
Thanks very much. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make the
butter you gave me
the other day? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}The {29_0}
you gave me the
other day... It was {NextPage_1}magnificent! Even
better than my
Ruby's...But don't {NextPage_1}tell her I said so! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That food you gave me
the other day was
excellent! {NextPage_49}
Quite on a par
with my Ruby's! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That fish you gave
me the other day was
so succulent! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}That fish you gave
me the other day was
very tasty! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}You seem to be
doing a good job on
your farm. I'm proud!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}I hear your crops
are very good. Keep
up the good work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}I hear you've turned
into quite the cook!
Ruby'll get jealous! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}I can tell
you've been working
hard. Good job. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}I hear rumors
that you're quite a
good cook. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear you've been
getting used to
farming. Good going. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear your crops are
getting better all
the time. Nice work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear your cooking
is better and better.
Can I try? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm thinking about
going on another
trip. {NextPage_49}
What do you think?
{41_2_1}Stay here.
Good idea.
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}You really think so?
I do yearn to
travel... {NextPage_49}
But I guess this
place needs me! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}You really think so?
I get excited at just
the thought of it! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I do like running the
Inn, but my heart
longs to travel... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are so many
places I have
yet to see! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}I love drinking
in places like this.
Care to join me? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}My favorite is the
{13}Moon Trip{17}.
Perfect for me, eh? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}This is so much
fun! You drink up,
too, {CharName_0}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Welcome!
Make yourself
at home. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome to the Inn!
Will you be staying?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}I just love it
here. Good food, good
drink... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}You like it here too,
eh? I know just how
you feel. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Somehow, food tastes
better in the spring,
with everything{NextPage_1}blooming around you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}I love this time
of year. It's great
for my appetite. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Some countries I've
been to are hot or
cold all year, but {NextPage_1}give me true spring
any day! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love eating
different seasonal
foods at different {NextPage_1}times of the year.
Don't you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}It's hot, isn't it?
I can't take the heat
very well... {NextPage_49}
Need something cold
to drink... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}Don't you feel
like eating ice cream
when it gets so hot? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is my favorite
time of year. {NextPage_49}
The autumn foliage
stirs my appetite! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Doesn't this weather
make you wish for an
autumn banquet? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}I can handle the
cold, as long as I
have a hot drink! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}This cold weather
makes you want to eat
something hot, no? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is my Ruby's
specialty. What do
you think? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}I've been all over
the world, so when I
say Ruby's cooking {NextPage_1}is good, you know
it's the truth! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}Sometimes I think
crops are missing
from the common {NextPage_1}garden. What do you
think? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_12}Maybe I'm imagining
things, but I could
swear that crops are{NextPage_1}disappearing from the
common garden!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've seen strange
dishes you wouldn't
imagine! {NextPage_49}
For instance, ice
with syrup on top, or
fried frog legs... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Vegetables you grow
yourself taste so
much better, {NextPage_1}don't you think? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've seen things you
wouldn't believe! {NextPage_49}
Tribes where people
don't wear clothes at
all, and hunt with {NextPage_1}spears, or countries
where great steel
birds fly in the sky.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}So, my Inn is filled
with things I've
found on my journeys.{NextPage_49}
I love each and every
one, you know. {NextPage_49}
{50_24_0_7}But, Rock went and
broke my favorite
vase...I was so mad!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_4}I... I...
I'm very disappointed
in him. Huh...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_24_0_3}Thanks for putting
up {CharName_4} for us!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry, but maybe
some other time.
Thanks, though. {NextPage_0}
