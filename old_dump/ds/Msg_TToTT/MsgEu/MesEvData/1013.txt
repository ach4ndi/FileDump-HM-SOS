\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136...\u232a?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136\u232a?\u2328What happened?\u2328You seemed dazed...
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136I called to you over and \u2328over, but you didn't reply.\u2328How alarming!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Are you feeling unwell?
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136No? But...\u2328...you are looking rather\u2328pale.\u232bPerhaps you are fatigued\u2328from your farm work?
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136You're certain?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4a\u2136If you're feeling unwell,\u2328you must tell me.\u232bSometimes people think they\u2328are fine when they actually\u2328need medical attention.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136I have your word, then?\u2328Thank you. That's good to\u2328hear.\u232bJust as a precaution, take\u2328a leisurely pace on your\u2328way home.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136\u232a...?
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136\u232a!!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136\u232a!?\u2328Hang in there,\u2328\u232a!!
\u1f41\u1fbd\u1f48\u2136Looks like fatigue.\u2328Take a nice long rest and\u2328you'll be as good as new.\u232bOkay, I need to go check on\u2328some other people.\u232bHiro, you look after\u2328\u232a.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2135Yes. I will...
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136\u232a...
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136Oh, you mustn't! Please get\u2328back in bed and rest!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136\u232a, you've been pushing\u2328yourself too hard. The\u2328fatigue caught up with you.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136You must spend the day\u2328resting!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136You most certainly are NOT\u2328perfectly fine.
\u2332 Sorry to make you worry.\u2328 No need to get upset!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136Worry?
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136...\u232a, you are always\u2328there for me, always\u2328supportive of me.\u232bI'm happy I finally get the\u2328chance to help you.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136I know that I am still just\u2328an apprentice...\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136But even so, if there is\u2328anything--anything!--\u2328that I can do for you...\u232bPlease call on me for\u2328assistance at any time.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4a\u2136If you are ever in distress,\u2328don't hesitate to tell me.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Fear not! I will do all in\u2328my power to aid you.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4d\u2136You see, I... I...\u2328that is...
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4d\u2136I lo... I lo...
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136I love having you as a\u2328friend, you see!!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136...\u270a...\u270a...
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136*Sigh*...
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4a\u2136But, \u232a, don't you\u2328understand WHY I am\u2328upset?
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4a\u2136No, how could you\u2328understand?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136Forgive my outburst.\u232bBut I do beg of you, \u232a,\u2328to take the care of your\u2328health more seriously!\u232bIf you cannot trust me, then\u2328I will ask Dr. Ayame to\u2328attend you instead.\u232bWell then, I will take my\u2328leave...
\u1f41\u1fbd\u1f48\u2136My my, \u232a, you're a\u2328bit thickheaded, aren't you?
\u1f41\u1fbd\u1f48\u2136Why do you think Hiro was\u2328so upset?\u232bIt's because he's always\u2328worrying about your\u2328well-being, \u232a.\u232bHe's your friend, right? He\u2328wants you to depend on him\u2328as more than just a doctor.\u232b\u1f41\u1fbd\u1f49\u2136Do you understand what I'm\u2328telling you?
\u1f41\u1fbd\u1f49\u2136Good!\u232b\u1f41\u1fbd\u1f48\u2136In that case, spend some\u2328time thinking over Hiro's\u2328feelings as you rest here.\u232bI have to get back to work.\u2328If you need anything,\u2328give me a call. Bye!
