Oh, hello {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Selling things, eh? Whatcha got?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, you don't have anything here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you playing a joke on people?
Um, can I watch?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you all sold out?
{50_4_0_10}Does that mean we get can out for dinner?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why are you here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, you're all sold out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}I see!
You're selling everything I hate!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You should probably try having a
wider selection, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How's business?
{41_2_0}Not bad.
Not good.
----------x----------
Hmm...
Well, keep it up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}{34_1_123}Heh, heh.
You're not much of a salesman, huh?
Don't worry. It'll pick up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}Hmmm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}I wonder if I worked too hard
today or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}I'm just not feeling well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I should take it easy today...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}Sigh... I wish something fun would happen.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}I suppose you're not interested in
looking for something fun to do?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}I haven't felt this bad in a long
time...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}I'm so bored.
Would you do something fun with me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess maybe I should rest today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning.............{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
............................
Morning.............{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
..................
Oh, never mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Go to work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi {2d}.{NextPage_1}Good job at work today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good job at work today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What're you doing?
It's late, you know...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}'s sleeping like a
baby, as usual.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Me? I'm not doing anything in particular.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can go to bed before me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm OK.
I'll go to sleep when I feel like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You go on to bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?!
Is it that late already?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry, you must be hungry.
Why don't you have a snack or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {2d}.
What are you up to?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's the big deal?
I'll be home soon enough.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm worried about {CharName_1}.
Why don't you go home first, {2d}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {2d}.
What are you up to?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}Great!
I just had a craving for that!
{41_3_0}Give it to her.
Don't give it to her.
Sell it to her.
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}Thanks. Woohoo!>{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}Um... Did you just come to
show it to me? Geez.
I'm hungry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}What's that supposed to mean?
Forget it, you cheapo!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ooh. Looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, that looks good.
{41_3_0}Give it to her.
Don't give it to her.
Sell it to her.
----------x----------
For me?{32_1_244}
{50_4_0_3}Wow! Thanks!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can show me that anytime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Uh...
I don't really want it that much...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks for showing it to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}You're not going to serve that for dinner!
Anything but that!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}Ugh!
I can't stand that stuff!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}Ugh, what is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}No no...
Just take that away...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Hi kiddo.
Take good care of your Dad for me, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}{CharName_1} is getting so big!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}What a funny face!
Wait, that's your face!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This kid sure likes to be picked up.
I hope we're not spoiling our child.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi, {23}.
Hungry?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, you sure like
{23}, don't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello kitty.
That cat never lets me pick it up...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, you sure like
cats, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow!!
For a second I thought it was flying.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
By the way, {CharName_1}
seems to like chasing chickens.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lay lots of eggs, now!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do chickens really lay golden
eggs if you take good care of them?
Anyway, that's what {CharName_25} said.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you let it go?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How tiny!
Don't let it get lost.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Try not to step on it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't think {23} would eat
it, do you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}{34_1_123}Hee, hee...
There's something funny about that one.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}Listen to it quack...
Hee, hee!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_26}Hmm...
It seems kind of mad at me.
Do you think it knows I laughed at it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}{34_1_123}Ha, ha, ha.
It looks just like its parents.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}Listen to it quack...
Hee, hee!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_26}Hmm...
It seems kind of mad at me.
Do you think it knows I laughed at it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of seed is that?
Are you going to plant it now?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you try planting it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you harvest that recently?
It came out nicely.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope it sells well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
Oh, good job.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Milk, huh?
Looks pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you take good care of the cows, they'll
give us lots of good milk, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We should be thankful to the cows!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Try not to spill any.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ooh! That cheese looks good!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
Oh, good job.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ooh! That butter looks good!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
Oh, good job.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that tomorrow's breakfast?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a good source of protein.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}Well done!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's eat it while it's fresh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Feel free to catch some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, a wild plant.
Is that for tonight's dinner?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We'll never go hungry around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, that looks pretty good.
Did you make it?
{41_2_0}Try it.
Looks good, huh?
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Really?
Thanks, I will.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}Saving it all for yourself?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A hoe, huh?
Going to be tilling some soil?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, good luck with your tilling.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A hoe, huh?
Going to be tilling some soil?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, good luck with your tilling.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, you got a new hoe?
That's nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, good luck with your tilling.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A hoe, huh?
Going to be tilling some soil?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, good luck with your tilling.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
You want a new hoe?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, good luck with your tilling.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A sickle, huh?
Planning on cutting something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, good luck with that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A sickle, huh?
Planning on cutting something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, good luck with that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you got a new sickle?
That's nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, good luck with that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A sickle, huh?
Planning on cutting something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, good luck with that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
You want a new sickle?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, good luck with that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A watering can, huh?
Going to do some watering?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your watering.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you got a new watering can?
Good for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your watering.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A watering can, huh?
Going to do some watering?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your watering.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
You want a new watering can?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your watering.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you got a new milker.
That's nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope you get lots of nice milk with it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, that's a milker, right?
That's kind of neat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope you get lots of nice milk with it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wouldn't mind helping you if I could use
that. But I guess I'd get sick of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You want a new milker?
Those poor cows, having to
put up with such an old milker.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope you get lots of nice milk with it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, clippers.
You do that by hand?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck shearing the sheep.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
New clippers, huh?
The sheep must be happy, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck shearing the sheep.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, clippers.
You use those on the sheep, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck shearing the sheep.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those clippers have seen a lot of
use, haven't they?
Do they still work well?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck shearing the sheep.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you get a new tool?
Good for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
You must really like that,
huh, {2d}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry.
I guess I can't appreciate it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ugh...
That's kind of dirty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a cool stone.
Where did you find it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, over there, huh?
Maybe I'll go get one myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are they easy to find?
Oh, darn...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty unusual stone...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}What is THAT?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You'll collect just about anything,
won't you, {2d}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you find that in the mountains?
It's pretty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It'd be even better if you could eat it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, a record.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you like music, too?
Hmm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Does that play well?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that some kind of seasoning?
Did you get it from {CharName_25}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I miss {CharName_25}'s cooking...
Maybe I'll stop by for a bite.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did {CharName_11} give you that
medal?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Around here, he's probably the
only person who would have a medal
to give, isn't he?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you put it someplace safe?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's nice.
It makes you feel like you're a winner.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Wow, that's an amazing necklace!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks like something might happen to
person who owns it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, sheet music, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_9} gave it to you, right?
I think she likes you, you know
that? Not that I'm jealous or anything.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I used to take piano lessons, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Hey, fireworks.
Neat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can you set that off by
yourself? Maybe I should supervise.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you have a child, you start
to think about your own parents.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My parents are both well, but...
We just don't see each other.
I wonder what they're up to?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've met a lot of people on my travels
but for some reason my own child is
the most interesting person I've ever met.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Most places I went the people
forgot how to smile like children, but
not here. They even smile at strangers.{NextPage_49}
So when I first came to {Location_43_30_23},
I thought I'd found something special.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what kind of adult {CharName_1}
will turn into...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, things have a way of working out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That thing you gave me... what was it?
Oh, whatever.
Anyway, it was good!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}That food you made for me
was good, {2d}.{NextPage_49}
I'm sure {CharName_1}'ll be a
great cook, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That food you made was
pretty good, {2d}.
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}I can tell you've been working
hard to make the farm great.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_10}{Location_36_2_128}{_0f}arm's{17} crops
are turning out very well. That's what
everybody says. Isn't that great?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}The food you cook is amazingly
good!❤
You should open a restaurant!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farm is starting to look pretty
good.
Thanks for working so hard.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The crops are turning out well.
I guess you like to grow crops and
things, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're better at cooking,
{2d}. Keep at it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't dislike animals, do you?
Why don't you try a little harder to
raise a variety of livestock?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you try planting some more
crops? We have enough land for it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I've got to study cooking, huh?
I never thought that you would be
this bad a cook...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I never thought I'd live on a farm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And have a kid, no less.
Wow. It's a trip without leaving the farm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was always such a drifter before.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But you know, not many people get
to have this kind of experience.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
To tell you the truth, I didn't think I'd
be able to keep this up this long.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The people here sure are interesting.
Before we got married, I used to watch
them quite a bit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It can be fun to watch people.
It seems like the folks around
{Location_43_30_23} really enjoy life.{NextPage_49}
That's what so nice about this place.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I used to see you all the time.
You sure wandered around a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...........
It's warmer, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_25}Yaaawn. I'm sleepy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everybody seems to be kind of
distracted at this time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whew! It's hot!
But it's kind of nice, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Weather like this makes me look forward
to going to the {Location_43_33_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I used to collapse from heat a lot when I
was younger. I liked watching the passing
people so much, I didn't notice the sun.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to eat something cool and
refreshing...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's cooler, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why is it that food seems to taste
so much better in the fall?
I just keep shoveling it in!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to listen to some music.
Maybe I'll go hear {CharName_27}
play his guitar.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} likes to bring me all
kinds of things from the forest.
Isn't that cute?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Brrr! It's chilly!
But I kind of like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A long time ago I went climbing in the
mountains in the winter and almost
got stranded there.{NextPage_49}
I can laugh about it now, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I kind of want to take a trip...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good job today, {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know, soil smells pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I should learn about farming, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The earth is kind of like a mother to
our crops, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We should be thankful to mother nature.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, sorry. Am I in your way?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is there anything I can do to help you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is kind of an interesting place, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be sure to rest if you get tired.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {2d}.
What are you doing here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I had some business with Ruby...
{50_4_0_26}I thought she could teach me cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}I love eating delicious things, but
making them is another story...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}But I have a good teacher, so
I'll catch on eventually.
You can count on it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cooking is pretty interesting once you
get into it. It's fun to experiment.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm here to learn cooking from
Ruby.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}I think you have to have some natural
talent and could be as good as Ruby.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}Ruby keeps getting mad at me.
She says I'm too sloppy.{NextPage_49}
It's kind of funny. I always think I'm
doing it exactly like she is...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cooking sure is hard...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome back.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you're hungry, you can't work, can you?
Even if you're busy, be sure to eat right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...{NextPage_49}
I suppose you really want your wife
to be able to cook well, right?{41_2_1}
Of course.
Not really.
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}I thought so...
I guess I'd better had Ruby teach me
some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I see.
{50_4_0_10}That makes me feel a little better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
........Hmmm...........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
Did you need something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I stand here looking up at the sky,
I feel like I could walk right up there
and float among the stars...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm kind of I'm tired of this life...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I should go traveling again...
With {CharName_1} this time...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I should go traveling again...
{CharName_1}'s grown now...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
Don't you have to work?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel so relaxed here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.........Sigh..................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Could you leave me alone?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
What are you doing here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like to watch the sunset here.
I've always liked sunsets. The sky and the
ocean turn all sorts of pretty colors...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I kind of feel like I'm coming home
when I visit here...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess they call this kind of feeling
homesickness...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cody's artwork sure makes you
think...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Could you just be quiet for a while?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry, but I'm a little busy now.
Could you make it later?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry, but thanks!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, isn't it nice to
to be with Daddy?{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you're all clean now!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't cry, {CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's raining, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
In weather like this, I always end up
thinking about the past...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Aren't your clothes wet?
Don't catch cold, now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You'd think the clouds would be empty
pretty soon with rain falling like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't it cute when you see a kid
out playing in the rain?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{23} always seems to go back
to his own house when it rains.
I guess he doesn't like being wet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you get wet in the rain, you should
take a nice hot bath to warm up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like the sound of the rain.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Rain, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're not getting any younger,
{2d}. Shouldn't you take it easy
on days like this? Don't get sick, now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Rain, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes it seems like {CharName_1}
will grow up without any help from us.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Even a little kid like {CharName_1}
should be treated like an individual and
not like a baby. Don't you think so?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want {CharName_1} to grow
up into an independent thinking
adult.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Kids are funny.
It's like they live in a world that we
can't even imagine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can tell who {CharName_1} is
interested in if you just pay attention.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you looked at the bookshelf in
{CharName_1}'s room?
There are some interesting books there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whew...
I don't think I'll ever get used to
housework...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The best thing for a kid {CharName_1}'s
age is just to be left alone...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I guess {CharName_1}'s
starting to become an adult.
We've got to grow as parents, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm glad that we have our own bedroom
now, but it's hard to clean...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm kind of bored...
Maybe I should take a trip somewhere...{NextPage_0}

{CharName_1} seems to think of
me as a friend and not a parent.
Well, I guess that's OK.{NextPage_0}

{2d}...
Do you remember Nina?
You know, that nice old lady?{NextPage_49}
Recently I've been thinking that
Nina probably led a pretty happy
life.{NextPage_49}
I guess...{NextPage_0}

Don't they say that when people get older
they tend to spend a lot of time thinking
about the past? That's true...{NextPage_0}

Whenever I look at {CharName_1},
I think how very quickly time passes.
It's amazing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {2d}.
How's it going?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not here for any particular
reason...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}'s fine.
That kid's good at playing alone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm really not suited for staying at
home all the time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't worry.
I'll go home soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}'s all grown up
now, so I don't need to be at home...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like to come here just to think.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} doesn't seem to
want to me around right now.
I guess it can't be helped.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm. What should we have for dinner today?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm. Where should I go next?{NextPage_0}
