...!
A {13}Blue Feather{17}... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A {13}Blue Feather{17}...
For me?
Can I really take it?
{41_2_0}Yes, it's yours.
Oops, my mistake.
----------x----------
Oh yeah...I forgot
you have a
girlfriend. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_5}I can't believe
you would play with
me like that! {NextPage_49}
You know how I feel
about you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_5}Why are you
teasing me like
this...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A {13}Blue Feather{17}!
Is it for me? {NextPage_49}
Don't be mean,
{CharName_0}.{NextPage_49}
{50_2_0_2}I know you
have a girlfriend! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A {13}Blue Feather{17}!
Is it for me? {NextPage_49}
{50_2_0_9}Sorry, but I
just don't think of
you that way... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_4}How dare you
use a {13}Blue Feather{17} to
make fun of someone! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are...Are you
serious....? {NextPage_49}
{50_2_0_9}Sorry, but I
just can't accept it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_148}Hmm?
What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You remembered my
birthday! {NextPage_49}
{50_2_0_3}Thank you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, sure. After I
put {CharName_1}
to bed, okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think he's
fallen asleep...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Walking like this, I
feel like we're young
lovers again! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_148}Hmm?
A present for me? {NextPage_49}
What could it be?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}Wow!
Thank you so much! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm so happy to be
married to you. {NextPage_49}
Let's grow old
together. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}This is great!
Thank you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello, {CharName_0}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Raising crops is hard
work, but it's fun to
watch them {NextPage_1}get bigger and
bigger, isn't it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you dislike farm
work, {CharName_0}?
{41_2_0}I hate it.
It's alright.
----------x----------
Is that so... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I always feel like
the growing crops
give some of their {NextPage_1}energy to me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you try
it to, {CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}That's good! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You might think
I'm strange for
saying so, though! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi, {CharName_0}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}Thanks, {CharName_0}.
I'm so glad you
remembered! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_4}Marlin!
How can you be
so rude! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't be upset,
{CharName_0}. I really
do like it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder why you say
something like that.{NextPage_49}
Well, I'm off to go
clean up now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I always relax when
I come here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Vesta is trying to
set me up to marry
someone, but I don't {NextPage_1}want to. I'd rather
fall in love with
someone I find{NextPage_1}by myself, wouldn't
you? {NextPage_49}
I don't know what to
do because she
keeps trying... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Would you go on a
blind date if you
were me?
{41_2_0}Why not?
No.
----------x----------
So you agree with
Vesta, do you? {NextPage_49}
I have to think
about this some
more... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm glad you agree
with me! {NextPage_49}
{50_2_0_3}I feel so much
better after talking
to you, {CharName_0}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've got to get back
home now, but thanks
for talking. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}I'm sorry if I
made you worry. {NextPage_49}
I just wanted to
think about marriage
alone, that's all. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What I realized is...{NextPage_49}
I think I've been
waiting for someone
like YOU all my life.{NextPage_49}
You're always so kind
to me, and you make
me feel good... {NextPage_49}
I want to be by your
side, so I can help
you too... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, will you
marry me...?
{41_2_0}Of course!
I'm sorry, but... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
R-really!? {NextPage_49}
{50_2_0_3}That's great!
I'm so embarrassed
now! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...I understand. {NextPage_49}
{50_2_0_7}I'm sorry...
Please...just
forget I asked. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess...{NextPage_49}
I think it's just too
early for me to
be with anybody.{NextPage_49}
I'm sure I'm fated
to meet somebody.{NextPage_49}
I just have to
be patient.
That's it... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope you meet
someone too,
{CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...!?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry, {CharName_0}. {NextPage_49}
I'm sure there's
someone better out
there for you... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}You say there's
someone better for
me, too? {NextPage_49}
I like to think so,
but who knows...?{NextPage_49}
I'm not going to sit
around depressed,
though! {NextPage_49}
I've got to go do
some work! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It was such a
beautiful wedding,
thank you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Vesta...Marlin...
I owe so much to
you both. {NextPage_49}
Thank you for the
wonderful time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is for me...? {NextPage_49}
Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You really mean it!?
{41_2_0}Of course.
Nay, not really. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}I'm so happy!
Thank you! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_7}You're so cruel! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is for me? {NextPage_49}
Thank you... {NextPage_49}
I appreciate the
thought, but I don't
think I'm ready to {NextPage_1}accept this yet. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}What?
This is for me? {NextPage_49}
Sorry, but I just
don't feel that way
about you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...I-I'm fine.
I was just dizzy
for a moment. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think I'm just
tired...That's all. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_30}!!
Haven't you done what
I asked yet? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where's the
{13}{26_0_34}{17} I
asked you for? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can never trust
a man to do a job
quickly. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Make sure you pick
ones that are fully
grown this time! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_30}!!
Haven't you done what
I asked yet? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where's the
{13}{26_0_32}{17} I
asked you for? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now dinner will
be late! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Honey, there are
ducks in the pond! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder where they
came from...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Want to keep them?
{41_2_0}Why not?
I don't think so.
----------x----------
Great!
Now what's a good
name for a male duck?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's too bad.
We should let them
go, then. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Input_128} it is. {32_3_232}
What about for a
female? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Input_128} it is. {32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
Now we've got to
show them where the
{Location_43_21_23} is.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_1}I'm glad it didn't
rain today.
{41_2_0}Me, too.
Come with me.
----------x----------
{50_2_0_0}How is work going?
{41_2_0}Fine.
Not so well.
----------x----------
{50_2_0_1}That's good.
See you later. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_35}What's wrong?
Is there anything
I can do to help? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I almost
forgot!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Bye now, {CharName_0}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_35}Come with you?
Why? Do you need
something? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry, I have to
go shopping.
{41_2_0}Later, then.
Shall I go too?
----------x----------
See you later. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What about your
work? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_30}, don't
be rude! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry...I... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why would he...?
{41_2_0}{CharName_30}'s fault.
I'm sorry. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Even you, {CharName_0}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going out now,
Vesta. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_7}I'm sorry, {CharName_0}.
{CharName_30} isn't a bad
person. {NextPage_49}
I bet he's just
worried about me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You said you wanted
to talk to me?{NextPage_49}
Can we talk later?
Bye now...!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_35}...! You scared me.
{50_2_0_0}Why don't you
take a break too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be very quiet, so
you don't scare the
animals.
{41_2_0}Don't move
Move
----------x----------
{50_2_0_26}I feel so at
home here. {NextPage_49}
All I have to do is
close my eyes and
drift away... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you feel it too?
{41_2_0}I do.
Not at all.
----------x----------
You must be tired.
Try not to work too
hard. Bye now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}You sure are
honest, aren't you?{NextPage_49}
You can come back
if you want, though.
Bye, now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...What a funny guy
you are. Bye now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}Hi, {CharName_0}.
How are you?{NextPage_80} 
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}I'm glad I ran
into you. {NextPage_49}
{50_2_0_1}I'm going to my
favorite spot today.
Want to come along?{32_3_232}
{41_2_0}No, thanks.
Sure!
----------x----------
{50_2_0_2}That's too bad... {32_3_232}
{50_2_0_0}I guess I'll
see you later, then. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}Great!
I'm so glad you can
come! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Look! The water in
the {Location_43_38_23} is
reflecting the sun! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I should be enjoying
myself, but I can't
help but worry...
{41_2_0}What about?
Cheer up.
----------x----------
You see...{CharName_29}
keeps trying to set
me up in an {NextPage_1}arranged marriage.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But I don't want
that! I want to find
someone myself! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_29} is so nice
to me...I don't want
to reject her help.
{41_2_0}Go for it.
I'd refuse, too!
----------x----------
I guess that wouldn't
hurt, would it? {NextPage_49}
Thanks, {CharName_0}.
You've cheered me up!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's not that I don't
want to get married
at all... {NextPage_49}
But, I shouldn't
burden you with this!{NextPage_49}
I'm sorry...I should
go home now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_0}You're right!
I should forget about
everything now...{NextPage_49}
{50_2_0_7}I'm sorry, though.
I can't stop thinking
about how {CharName_29} is{NextPage_1}trying to set me up
in a marriage I don't
even want...{NextPage_49}
I'm so sorry...
I have to go now... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He was very nice,
but I just don't
feel for him... {NextPage_49}
I'm sorry, Vesta...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please let me
think on it
some more. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome home.
I've been waiting
to talk to you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I turned down the
marriage.
You see, I... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like YOU,
{CharName_0}!{NextPage_49}
Do you feel the
same way about me?
{41_2_0}I do.
I'm sorry...
----------x----------
I can't believe it!
Thank you for saying
so! I'm so happy! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good bye... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...
I'm so...
embarrassed...{NextPage_49}
Please forget I ever
said anything! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......
Bye now... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good morning,
{CharName_0}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_29}... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_26}I owe you for so
much... Thanks for
the wonderful time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you, {CharName_30}.
Look after {CharName_29}
for me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}Bye bye,
you two! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_7}{CharName_30}, can't you
be happy for me...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}What...?
I thought I told you
how I feel already.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}Ah...
Don't you have to
work?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}Don't mind {CharName_30}.
He really doesn't
mean it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_5}How cruel of you!
Are you trying to
make me feel bad? {NextPage_49}
...I'm going home.
Bye. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_2}Really...? {32_3_232}
I understand.
Bye now. {NextPage_80} 
----------x----------
I know it's strange
to talk to you about
this, since you {NextPage_1}confessed your
feelings for me. {NextPage_49}
Still, I can't stand
the thought of
marrying this guy!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}So you still
like me? I'd love to
be with you! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}You mean you don't
like me any more...? {NextPage_49}
I feel so horribly
embarrassed now... {NextPage_49}
Please forget all
about this! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}So this is what it
feels like to be
proposed to! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My mother received a
{13}Blue Feather{17} from my
father, long ago... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I always dreamed
of getting one
myself... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Can this be real?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And I thought you had
a girlfriend! I'll
gladly accept it! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll gladly marry
you! I've waited for
this moment...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I always dreamed
about receiving a
{13}Blue Feather{17}... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll be going now...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dummy {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dummy {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dummy {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dummy {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dummy {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}Wait, {CharName_30}! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_7}It's okay, {CharName_30}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}{CharName_0} was just
teasing me, that's
all. Don't take it {NextPage_1}so seriously!
Let's go home now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_26}I hope you'll be
happy with whomever
you are giving it to.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good morning.
It's me,
{CharName_2}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know it's sudden,
but I wanted to
talk to you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Things have been so
hectic lately... {NextPage_49}
First I left Vesta...
Then I confessed my
feelings for you... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Even you proposing
to me! {NextPage_49}
You must wonder what
I'm talking about...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You see...I think I
did the wrong thing
in turning you down. {NextPage_49}
Would you be willing
to propose to me
again?
{41_2_0}Propose again.
Remain single.
----------x----------
It's taken me so
long, but I think
I've finally {NextPage_1}found happiness! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to go tell
{CharName_29} and {CharName_30}. {NextPage_49}
I don't know if
I can even walk
straight, though! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I understand you
saying that... {NextPage_49}
I just couldn't
give up on you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You must have
a reason for staying
single. {NextPage_49}
I should find a
goal for my own life,
too... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure you must
think I'm crazy, but
I couldn't stop {NextPage_1}thinking about you.
I never stopped
hoping... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I'm not good
enough to be your
wife...?
{41_2_0}Propose.
Remain single.
----------x----------
This is a
{13}Blue Feather{17}!{NextPage_49}
When I was a child I
dreamed about this...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...I understand.
I won't ask again. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But, you must have
a reason for staying
single. {NextPage_49}
I should find a
goal for my own life,
too... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know it's sudden,
but I wanted to
talk to you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Umm...Do you want to
get married? Is there
anybody you like? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_29} tried to
set me up, but I
turned it down. {NextPage_49}
I haven't been able
to stop thinking
about you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've come to regret
not accepting that
{13}Blue Feather{17}.{NextPage_49}
Would you still
take me back?
{41_2_0}Propose.
Remain single.
----------x----------
...YES!{NextPage_49}
I'm so glad I had
the courage to
come today! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I understand.
I was too scared then
to grab happiness... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I turned down an
arranged marriage. {NextPage_49}
I could never marry
a man I didn't love. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I realized that I
love you. Would you
think of marrying me?
{41_2_0}Propose.
Remain single.
----------x----------
A {13}Blue Feather{17}...!!!
Is it really for me?!
I can't believe it! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm so glad I found
the courage to come! {NextPage_49}
I have to go tell
{CharName_29} and {CharName_30}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...I understand.
I thought I may
as well try. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to find my
own reason for
living now. Good bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_29} tried to set
me up in a marriage,
but I turned it down.{NextPage_49}
I've never been able
to forget about you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}I'm so happy!
I'll treasure this! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...
I'm sorry. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're so kind and
so much fun to be
with. {NextPage_49}
If you let me, I'll
be with you...always.
{41_2_0}Propose.
Remain single.
----------x----------
It's a {13}Blue Feather{17}!
{CharName_0}...I'll
treasure it forever! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry, {CharName_29}.
But he had nothing
to do with it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_29}!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry...I didn't
want to upset you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_29}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You see...I realized
I do love you. {NextPage_49}
I was running away
from it before, but
no longer! {NextPage_49}
Please, tell me how
you feel!
{41_2_0}Propose.
Remain single.
----------x----------
A {13}Blue Feather{17}...?
{CharName_0}, I... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you so much,
{CharName_29}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll try to be the
best wife I can. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is the right
thing for me, {CharName_29}.
I know it is. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't regret
falling in love with
you, {CharName_0}. {NextPage_49}
I just have to find
another purpose in
life, that's all... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_29}...
He's already turned
me down, you see. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A {13}Blue Feather{17}!
Is it really for me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Yes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll do my best to
be a good wife! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_29}...
I'm truly sorry. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I understand,
{CharName_0}.{NextPage_49}
I'll just have to
find another
worthwhile reason{NextPage_1}for my life. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}...
Do you still want to
marry me?
{41_2_0}Propose.
Remain single.
----------x----------
Are you sure...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't the feather
beautiful? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think so, too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Won't you say
something to {CharName_29}?
{41_2_0}Propose to {CharName_2}.
Please go home.
----------x----------
See? {CharName_0} is
troubled too{33_0}{_c8}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Wow, amazing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm so happy!
I'll be the best
wife ever! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You think of me
like your daughter,
don't you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's enough for me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's go home now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry for bugging you
early, {CharName_0}.
Bye now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You see?
{CharName_0} is
troubled too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah...{CharName_0},
you're not thinking
about marriage...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm worried about
what you think of
me... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's not that I don't
trust you...But I
have a hard time{NextPage_1}believing this!
Are you serious?
{41_2_0}Propose.
Remain single.
----------x----------
I want to get
married, and I
don't dislike you,{NextPage_1}but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please forgive me.
Good bye. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's not his fault,
{CharName_29}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's go together
until you have
to go.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See? {CharName_0} is
troubled too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now that we're
married, think of a
nickname for me! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Stop that, {CharName_30}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}{34_1_147}Hee hee, {CharName_1},
are you happy to
play with Daddy?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {2d},
what do you think
about having {NextPage_1}{CharName_1} inherit
the farm?
{41_2_0}Of course!
If he wants to.
----------x----------
I agree. He was born
on a farm, after all!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess... It's too
early to be deciding
things for him! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Go to bed now,
{CharName_1}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, don't
forget to put more
food in the fridge.{NextPage_49}
Good night. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yaaawwn... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good morning,
{2d}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good morning,
{2d}♪
You're up early.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's morning,
{CharName_1}! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's already late,
so I'm going to bed,
{2d}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sweet dreams,
{CharName_1}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you don't go to
sleep, you won't
grow up big and {NextPage_1}strong like your
father, baby! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good boy♪
Do you want to say
goodnight to Daddy?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time for bed,
{CharName_1}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}Where did he go?
It's past his
bedtime... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_0}{2d}!
I'm going to look
for {CharName_1}! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}I wonder where
{CharName_1} went...
It's time for bed. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}I'm going to
look around for him. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}Ahh, thank goodness!
I was beginning to
get worried! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_1}Hee hee.
What a bundle of
trouble he is!{NextPage_49}
Now it's time for
bed, {CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now it's really
time for bed. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's late, baby.
Let's go night-night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's {CharName_1}'s
bedtime.
I hope he's asleep...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome home. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just put {CharName_1}
to bed. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He's been watching
a lot of TV lately...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if he's
interested in farm
work...? {NextPage_49}
He gets so serious
when he watches the
farming programs! {NextPage_49}
What do you think,
{2d}?
{41_2_0}You're right!
Too young to tell.
----------x----------
That's right. I bet
he'll want to start
helping you out soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_26}Maybe you're right,
but I bet he will
want to be like you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
♪A necklace of...♪
♪white flowers...♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
♪The necklace...♪
♪you gave me...♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a good,
{CharName_1}, good boy.
Just wait a little
longer, okay?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a good boy!
Let's sing that song
for Daddy★ {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {2d}!
{CharName_1} has turned
into quite a singer!{NextPage_49}
He repeats songs
right after I do! {NextPage_49}
I think he's got
a talent! {NextPage_1}{41_2_0}I agree!
Too young to tell.
----------x----------
I'm sure he does!
He could be a star! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}You think so...?{32_3_232}
{50_2_0_26}I'm getting too
excited, aren't I? {NextPage_49}
{50_2_0_3}But I still think we
should encourage him,
don't you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}What are you
drawing, baby? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}...Daddy?{NextPage_49}
{50_2_0_25}...That's very good!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} drew this!
What do you think
it is?
{41_3_0}A flower.
Me, of course.
I don't know.
----------x----------
That's right. It's
a flower. Don't you
think it's good? {NextPage_49}
{50_2_0_3}I think he
has real talent... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}Do you really
think so? Hmm...
If you say so...{NextPage_49}
{50_2_0_3}I think he
has real talent... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Really? It looks
like a flower to me,
but {CharName_1} says{NextPage_1}it's Daddy... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But think of it
this way.{NextPage_49}
Maybe {CharName_1} even
has talent we haven't
realized yet! {NextPage_49}
He could even be a
genius... What do you
think? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}What are you doing,
my little cutie? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}What a good job
you're doing! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, don't you
think {CharName_1} has
good hand eye{NextPage_1}coordination?
{41_2_0}Really...?
Yes. He's my son.
----------x----------
He loves to jump and
play. Maybe he'll be
a sports star... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're right.
He is your son,
after all. {NextPage_49}
{50_2_0_3}I can't wait until
he grows up and
becomes famous! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know, {2d},
{CharName_1} loves books.{NextPage_49}
Even just the other
day, he was... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}What kind of
book are you reading,
{CharName_1}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you reading,
baby?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}I'm going to go
make dinner now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you still
reading, {CharName_1}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're so smart,
aren't you, {CharName_1}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}'s so smart,
I bet he'll win the
Nobel Prize when he{NextPage_1}grows up!
{41_2_0}I bet you're right.
Don't be silly!
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}I'm sure he'll
be a famous
professor! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}Ha ha ha...I guess
you're right. {NextPage_49}
I still think we
should encourage him,
though! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Umm...I hate to stick
my nose into farm
business, but is {NextPage_1}everything going
alright? {NextPage_49}
{CharName_7} says your
shipments are pretty
low, recently...
{41_2_0}I'll try harder.
Who cares?
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}Are you serious?
{41_2_0}Just kidding!
Yup, I am.
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}You must be joking!?
{41_2_0}I am. Don't worry.
Not at all!
----------x----------
{50_2_0_4}You really don't care
about the farm?!
{41_2_0}Just kidding!
Yep, that's right.
----------x----------
I feel better now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't joke like that!
I feel better now,
though. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't want to make
{CharName_29} worried about
me... {NextPage_49}
Let's both take care
and work hard! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_30}How could you...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_30}Why are you
saying this...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_30}......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_7}Okay, I give up.
Do whatever you want!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear a beautiful
voice...Is that
{CharName_20}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wait... It was
{CharName_1}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {2d}, I
I think {CharName_1}
may be musically{NextPage_1}inclined. Even
{CharName_20} praised him.{NextPage_49}
What do you think?
{41_2_0}I agree.
I doubt it.
----------x----------
I'm glad you
think so too! {NextPage_49}
I want him to find
what he loves to do{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure he'll become
a famous musician! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe you're right,
and I am getting
too excited. {NextPage_49}
I do think we
should encourage
him, though! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He could become a
great singer! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if {CharName_1}
has the makings of
an artist... {NextPage_49}
What do you think?
{41_2_0}I think he does.
It's too early.
----------x----------
If {CharName_21} says so,
then it must be true!{NextPage_49}
When he gets older,
{CharName_1} might start
making sculpture{NextPage_1}of his own! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're right - It is
too early to know. {NextPage_49}
If {CharName_21} says so,
though, we should
encourage him. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whew... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Of course he
couldn't win against
{CharName_13}! {NextPage_49}
{CharName_13} is much
older, you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} is a really
fast runner, {2d}. {NextPage_49}
Even {CharName_11} said so.
Do you think he could
be an athlete?
{41_2_0}Maybe he could.
I doubt it.
----------x----------
He could be a
marathon runner when
he grows up! {NextPage_49}
{CharName_13}'s rival,
even... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're probably
right... {NextPage_49}
I still think we
should encourage him,
though. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know that
scholar wanted
{CharName_1} for an {NextPage_1}assistant? I think
he might be the
academic type. {NextPage_49}
What do you think?
{41_2_0}I think so, too.
Nah, I doubt it.
----------x----------
Yes, our {CharName_1}
will probably grow up
to be a scholar...! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess you're
right. He is still a
child, after all. {NextPage_49}
I still think we
should encourage him,
though. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}... I'm kind
of worried about
the farm lately. {NextPage_49}
I don't mean to
intrude, but...Is the
farm doing okay?
{41_2_0}I'll try harder.
I hate farming.
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}Are you serious?
{41_2_0}Just kidding!
Yes, of course!
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}You must be joking!?
{41_2_0}I am. Don't worry.
Not at all!
----------x----------
{50_2_0_4}You really don't care
about the farm?!
{41_2_0}Sorry for the joke.
Yep, that's right.
----------x----------
I feel better now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't joke like that!
I feel better now,
though. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}Now that {CharName_1}
is older, I wanted to
build on the house. {NextPage_49}
Now I feel more
confident about it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_30}But that's... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_30}What a thing to say! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_30}......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_7}Okay, I give up.
Do whatever you want!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know how you feel,
but... {32_3_232}
----------x----------
You should listen
to your parents,
you know! {32_3_232}
----------x----------
I can't believe you! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, what are you
reading? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you want
a snack? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...What? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What...?
Is everything okay?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Go ask your father.
He'd be glad to
teach you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see what you mean. {32_3_232}
Okay, I'll tell him
first for you,{NextPage_1}so you go
talk to him,
alright?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {2d}.
About {CharName_1}... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He's so interested in
the farm lately. {NextPage_49}
If he comes and
asks you, will you
teach him about it? {NextPage_49}
{41_2_0}Of course.
I'm too busy.
----------x----------
You're a great
father, {2d}!{NextPage_49}
{50_2_0_3}Like father,
like son!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's why it's so
hard for him to ask
you himself! {NextPage_49}
If you're so busy,
though...{52_0_0_0}
{39_128}{Input_128}{_df}y not
have him help you...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {2d}.
About {CharName_1}... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if he's
interested in farm
work at all...
{41_2_0}I doubt it.
He might be.
----------x----------
I think you're right.
That's okay, though. {NextPage_49}
He should decide
what he likes and
live his own life. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm...If you think
so, {2d}. {NextPage_49}
If he isn't,
though, he should do
whatever he wants, {NextPage_1}don't you think? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How is the farm
these days...?
{41_2_0}Just fine.
Not so great.
----------x----------
Really? {50_2_0_35}
If you say so...{NextPage_49}
{CharName_1} is growing
up now, so do your
best. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What will we do...?
{CharName_1} is growing
up and everything... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Music is fine,
but you should help
your father out, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Art is fine,
but you should help
your father out, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sports are fine,
but you should help
your father out, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Studying is fine,
but you should help
your father out, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm glad you like
helping out on the
farm, but you should{NextPage_1}try to expand your
horizons some more. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}{CharName_1} isn't
back yet.{NextPage_49}
What's he doing out
so late...?
{41_2_0}I'll go look.
He's grown up now.
----------x----------
I know, but I can't
help but worry. Won't
you look for him?
{41_2_0}Alright.
He's fine.
----------x----------
Thanks so much... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So he was listening
to {CharName_27} play
his guitar, was he?{NextPage_49}
That's fine, but
I worry when he
stays out so late!{NextPage_49}
...I wonder if he has
the makings of a
musician... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mmmm, okay...
If you say so... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Look, he's back! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where were you,
young man? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, wait...! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So he was listening
to {CharName_27} play
his guitar, was he?{NextPage_49}
That's fine, but
I worry when he
stays out so late!{NextPage_49}
...I wonder if he has
the makings of a
musician... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I ask a
funny question?
{41_2_0}No.
Sure.
----------x----------
Are you in a bad
mood?! You don't even
want to know {NextPage_1}what I was going to
ask?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Can a round
object look square?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}???
Of course not!
----------x----------
I don't understand
either... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're right...
Of course not! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} asked me
the same thing
all the sudden. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...What do you mean?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmmm, really?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...That's why.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet he's going to
be an artist! {NextPage_49}
He has such an
artistic way of
looking at things...!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's wrong...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sure...
What should I do? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ready? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
On your marks...
GO! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Go {CharName_1} !{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Finished! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_13} sure is fast!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}{CharName_1} isn't
back yet.
What's he doing out{NextPage_1}so late...?
{41_2_0}I'll go look.
He's grown up now.
----------x----------
I know, but I can't
help but worry. Won't
you look for him?
{41_2_0}Alright.
He's fine.
----------x----------
Thanks so much...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So he was listening
to {CharName_19} talk,
was he ? {NextPage_49}
That's fine, but
I worry when he
stays out so late! {NextPage_49}
...I wonder if he has
the makings of a
scholar... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK, if you say so. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Look, he's back! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where were you,
young man? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, wait...! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So he was listening
to {CharName_19} talk,
was he? {NextPage_49}
That's fine, but
I worry when he
stays out so late! {NextPage_49}
...I wonder if he has
the makings of a
scholar... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing
by yourself? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Why?
I don't know a lot
about it... {NextPage_49}
Before {CharName_1} was
born, in the spring,
{CharName_7} came here {NextPage_1}with your father.{NextPage_49}
He had come once
before, with
someone else... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
According to
{CharName_7}, that person
was your father's {NextPage_1}father, so your
grandfather... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't really
know anything else.{NextPage_49}
{CharName_7} doesn't
talk much, you know? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your father doesn't
like to talk about
it, either. {NextPage_49}
He just says he took
over the farm
because his father{NextPage_1}wanted him to. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Really?
I'm sure that'll make
your father happy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Eeek! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You surprised me,
{CharName_0}! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is everybody happy
on the farm today? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_64}Where was that
handkerchief...♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is unusual.{32_1_244}
What are you both
doing in here? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_12}Is something wrong?
{41_2_0}Nothing.
Girl troubles.
----------x----------
{50_2_0_30}Oh, really? {32_1_244}
You can tell me. {NextPage_49}
{50_2_0_3}But,{32_1_244} I understand
if it's a
"guy thing".{NextPage_49}
Hee hee, kind of
sad, actually... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now where was that
handkerchief...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_30}Is that so?{32_1_244}
{50_2_0_3}Could it be Kate...? {32_1_44}{NextPage_49}
I can tell even
without your telling
me! Hee hee♪{NextPage_49}
{50_2_0_9}Do you think
she's in your
league, though...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_64}What's wrong?{32_1_244}
I heard a shout...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}Ah... {32_1_244}
Hee hee... {32_1_244}
He likes her, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_1}It's great to fall
in love, you know? {NextPage_49}
Even if it doesn't
work out, it's still
a good experience. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}I just hope... {32_1_244}
I hope he'll be
happy... {NextPage_49}
{50_2_0_26}I remember when
I was young... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wait... {32_1_244}
What was I just
doing...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you
looking at...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you
thinking about...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...It's been a long
time since then. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Our son has grown up,
and we've grown
old... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your hair is gray,
and your face is
wrinkly... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...What?
{41_2_0}You're wrinkly.
You're still pretty.
----------x----------
{50_2_0_4}How rude...! {32_7_208}
{50_2_0_3}But...I guess we're
both old fogies now!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_10}Really?
That's nice of you
to say... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We've still got a
lot ahead of us,
though! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's wrong!?
What's wrong with
you...!! {NextPage_49}
Quick, {CharName_1},
get Dr. {CharName_31} now!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's happening...!?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Does it hurt...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't believe
this... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes the best
go earliest... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Will you play a song
for my husband in
heaven, {CharName_27}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So, would you like
something today? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
No?
Come again any time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What would you
like?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{13}{29_0}{17}
it is, then. {NextPage_49}
You already have {2a_0_3}.
How many would you
like today? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry, your rucksack
is full for the
{13}{29_0}{17}.{NextPage_49}
Come back after you
get you get it
organized.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry, but you don't
have enough money. {NextPage_49}
----------x----------
{2a_0_2} unit(s) of
{13}{29_0}{17}.
It'll be {2a_1_7}G.{NextPage_49}
Is it okay? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}Thanks very much.
Come again any time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thought better of it?
That's okay, come
again any time! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
May I see what
you're selling? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, let me see
what you're
selling! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's nothing
here! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll have to come
earlier next time,
I guess. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm...There's nothing
I need today. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry, but there is
nothing I want right
now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll take the
{29_0}.
How much is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
Not for sale.
----------x----------
{34_1_148}Really?
{50_2_0_3}Thank you! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2a_2_5}G?
I'll take it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I didn't realize
that. Sorry. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll come again. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0}
looks good. How much
is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
Not for sale. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}.....Ahh.... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}Oh, nothing....
Ahh...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_2}...Leave me alone!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}I'm just not
in a good mood today.
Sorry. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Good morning!
It's a great day
for work! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Hi, {CharName_0}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Good evening.
How was your day? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}I'm glad to meet
you here! {NextPage_49}
I was getting scared
because it's so
late... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}What are you
doing here so late?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Hi, welcome! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Imagine meeting
at this time! Are you
always up this late?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Hi, {CharName_0}.
Do you come
here often? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}That looks delicious.
{41_2_0}Try it.
It's all mine.
----------x----------
Really?
{34_1_147}Thanks a lot! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_148}{50_2_0_10}What?
Oh, don't worry...
I won't take it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147} {50_2_0_3}That looks
delicious!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks great!
{41_2_0}It's yours.
It's all mine.
----------x----------
{50_2_0_1}...Really?
I'm in your debt. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I didn't know you
liked those so much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}That looks great. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_148}Sorry, I don't
like that at all!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry...I just have
different tastes than
you, I guess. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}What IS that?
Please don't try
to give me any! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}That's not very
nice of you,
{CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Hi, {CharName_1}.
On a walk with
Daddy today? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He's looking more
like {CharName_3}
every day! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Hi, {CharName_1}.
On a walk with
Daddy today? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_4} and {CharName_1}
come to my place and
have lunch together.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Walking the {23}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}Good doggie.
He's so cute,
isn't he? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}What a cute cat! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}What a nice
kitty you are! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a pretty
chicken! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute chick!
Was it born at
{24_2}Farm? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Chickens are great
because they lay
eggs. {NextPage_49}
Is this a hen? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a large
duck that is! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How cute.
Is that a duck? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've always thought
ducks faces look
friendly. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you planting
that next? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope you have a
great harvest at
{24_2}Farm. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_148}Did you grow this
at {24_2}Farm?
What a great job!
{41_2_0}You can have it.
It's mine.
----------x----------
{34_1_148}I can really have it?
I'll tell you how
it tastes later. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's no substitute
for hard work! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looks good to me.
You should be
proud! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk looks good.
Is it from
{24_2}Farm? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Fresh milk is the
best!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that
cheese?
I'm impressed! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cheese seems so
hard to make... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that
butter? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I make butter, too.
With handmade butter,
you have to shake {NextPage_1}it over and over
again. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did your chicken
lay that egg?
{41_2_0}Take it.
Isn't it nice?
----------x----------
{34_1_147}{50_2_0_3}Gee, thanks!
I'll use it in a
dish tonight!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've been enjoying
egg dishes a lot
lately. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We want to keep
chickens too, but
everyone was too busy{NextPage_1}to look after them...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You caught that
fish? How impressive!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You should cook it up
while it's still
fresh. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks delicious!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if I should
go gather some
myself. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks pretty
good, {CharName_0}.
{41_2_0}Here you go.
It's all for me.
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}Really?
Thanks a lot! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Tell me the recipe
sometime. {NextPage_49}
I'm quite a cook,
too, you know. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let me know if you
make anything else
good! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a strange hoe!
Does it work like a
regular one? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want one like
that, too! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a rare type of
hoe! How does it
work? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you like to
grow crops? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that your hoe?
Doesn't look
very used. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Use it more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that the hoe you
are using? The one I
use is much older! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe has
potential - you just
need to break it in!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've broken that
hoe in quite well! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_1}You sure are
working hard.
Impressive! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That sickle sure is
an odd shape... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks pretty
sharp, but you
shouldn't carry {NextPage_1}it around, you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now that's an unusual
sickle! Know how to
use it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to try
using it myself. {NextPage_49}
Is it any different
from regular ones?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That sickle is
brand new,
isn't it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You haven't used it
much yet, but when
you do, it'll get {NextPage_1}even better at
cutting. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that your sickle?
Mine is much more
broken in than that!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You shouldn't carry
it around, you know.
That's dangerous! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That sickle looks
pretty well worn in.{NextPage_49}
You've got to take
good care of it, or
it'll rust. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm impressed with
what you've done
with that sickle! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've never seen a
watering can like
that! {NextPage_49}
How does it work? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a nice
watering can you
have!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It must be fun to
water with such a
new watering can! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You do use that
watering can, right? {NextPage_49}
It looks virtually
unused... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nice watering can,
{CharName_0}. Do
you like using it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got to adjust
your watering to the
crop's condition. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a wonderfully
broken in watering
can that is! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You must have used it
a lot to get it this
well worn in! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A new milker! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope you get lots
of use out of it! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That machine's
for milking cows,
right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It must be nice to
have fresh milk
all the time! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a cow milker,
isn't it? It looks
pretty old... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you're going to
use a milker, it
should be clean.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are for
shearing sheep,
right? {NextPage_49}
That must be
a tough job! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Shearing sheep
must be such
hard work... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It must be fun to
shear sheap with
those! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Shearing sheep looks
like fun! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is this the season
for shearing sheep? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't the sheep catch
colds without their
coats...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those clippers look
pretty well used.{NextPage_49}
You must be
pretty good by now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think sheep look
cute without their
coats! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just love shiny
new tools! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I always find
excuses to use new
tools! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Going to do some
work? Good job. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We've both got a
lot of work to do. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you break this
tool in all by
yourself? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't it great to
break in a tool all
by yourself, until {NextPage_1}it fits your hand
just perfectly? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a beautiful
stone. Are you
going to sell it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's very pretty! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a funny thing
you have there? Are
you going to sell it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Guys like things
like that,
don't they? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that wild? Where
did you pick it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't pick too much! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, a record! Do
you own a record
player? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love listening to
music... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Did you get that
from {CharName_25}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_25} is such a
good cook. I'd love
to learn from her!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}What a lovely medal!
I bet it was
{CharName_11}'s. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If it were mine, I'd
like to keep it... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...
That has a nice
decoration...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take good care
of this now! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_9} gave
it to you.{NextPage_49}
I think she wants you
to keep it until
she's ready.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Keep it and give it
back to {CharName_9}
when she's ready.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_148}...!
You surprised me!{NextPage_49}
Is there gunpowder
in that?! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just try not to burn
yourself with those
fireworks! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing
with it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If it's something
valuable, keep it
in a safe place.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I was a child
living in {Location_43_31_23},
{CharName_29} used to bring{NextPage_1}us fresh vegetables.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everybody was against
me coming here with
{CharName_29}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm glad I came to
{Location_43_30_23},
though it means {NextPage_1}being away from my
parents... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you
gave me was great!
I loved it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Remember the
{29_0} you
gave me? {NextPage_49}
You know they're
hard to grow...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That {29_0} you
gave me was really
good. I'm impressed. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you
gave me was
delicious. {NextPage_49}
Even {CharName_29}
was impressed! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0}
was great.
Thanks a lot. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0}
was great.{NextPage_49}
Will you give me
the recipe sometime?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0}
was great.{NextPage_49}
You're turning into
quite a cook! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I ate the
{29_0} you
gave me. Thanks. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}I hear you're doing a
great job on the farm
lately! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The vegetables you
grow are so good,
{CharName_0}. {NextPage_49}
I have a lot to
learn from you! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Since you're such a
good cook, will you
teach me sometime? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's great you can
run the farm so well
all by yourself! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Raising crops isn't
easy, but you're
doing a great job. {NextPage_49}
You're kind of an
inspiration to me... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you cook a lot?
I hear your food
is excellent! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Seems like you've
gotten used to farm
life. Good job. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear you're turning
into quite a
good farmer. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm tyring to learn
how to cook. Will you
teach me? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My room is the loft,
but I like it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you like living
here, {CharName_0}?
I love it! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} is so cute!
He'll grow up healthy
and happy on the {NextPage_1}farm, that's for
sure! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wasn't very healthy
as a child, so
looking at {CharName_1} {NextPage_1}makes me happy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}'s gotten
so big! {NextPage_49}
I wonder if he'll
take over the farm? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Little boys must be
a handful to raise!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} has grown
up so fast! {NextPage_49}
He's even become
handsome!
{34_1_147}Tee hee... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wood houses are
great, aren't they?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes {CharName_29}
makes us bread.
It's always good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_30} looks like
he's always sulking,
but he's a good{NextPage_1}guy at heart. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like coming here
once in a while. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't it relaxing? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_29}'s vegetables
are great, you know. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry I'm not a very
good hostess... Come
any time, though! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope you make lots
of good veggies,
{CharName_0}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Places like this
somehow make me
nervous... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}...Whew.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love how everything
blooms this time
of year. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is the busiest
time of year on
a farm. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's gotten so hot!
How is everything
at {24_2}Farm? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be sure the animals
don't get too hot. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Things have finally
cooled off after
that summer.{NextPage_49}
It's a good season
to do anything now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Aren't the autumn
leaves beautiful? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's getting cold.
Are you ready for
winter? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Make sure your
animals don't catch
cold. {NextPage_49}
Or you either! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love watching
crops grow... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I come look
at your fields later?
How are they doing? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you like it here
too, do you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love the sound of
the wind in the
leaves... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}...Sorry.
I don't want to think
about anything now...{NextPage_49}
...I know I can't be
like this forever,
but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_7}...Sorry.
I can't do it.
I'm gonna cry...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_7}You can leave
me alone.
Don't worry about me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_7}Don't...
worry about...me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}I wonder if I really
know you...?
I'm kind of worried.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...What?
Oh, sorry.
I'm busu now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't worry.
I feel better now.{NextPage_49}
I just need some time
alone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi, {CharName_0}!
I've been so
happy lately! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I start daydreaming
about you, then
{CharName_29} gets mad{NextPage_1}at me! Hee hee.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was just thinking
about you...Now I
meet you by chance! {NextPage_49}
It can't be
coincidence... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_7}...Sorry.
I just can't...
I'll cry...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_29} is teaching
me how to cook. {NextPage_49}
That way I'll be able
to cook good food
myself some day... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks, but I'm busy
now. Sorry. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I appreciate the
thought, but no
thanks. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time for bed
now... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time for me to
sleep, so good bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to go out
now, so... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I must be leaving,
so good bye. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Bye now... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_29}, today is the
Harvest Festival,
so let's have fun. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Eat all you want. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wasn't it nice,
{CharName_1}❤ {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}Aren't you glad
you got all clean,
{CharName_1}? Ha ha♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}!
Poor {CharName_1}! {NextPage_0}
