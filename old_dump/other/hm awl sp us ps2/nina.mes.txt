I think I'm going to
get to bed now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time for bed, you see.
You ought to be heading home now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pleasant dreams.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm about to go
out, I'm afraid.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to go out now.
See you later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello?
Excuse me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Excuse me, {CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah, how disappointing.
It looks like you're all sold out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, well--I suppose I'll just
have to check back later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, don't mind me.
I'm just browsing, you see.
Browsing can be fun, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is this all you have?
Hmm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like this {29_0}.
How much?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
{34_1_96}What? Really?!
My, that's affordable. Thank you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah, I see.
All right--I'll take it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_97}Oh, my...
That's too bad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think I'm going
to call it a day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you're {CharName_0}, our newcomer.
My husband Galen and I live
here in Forget-Me-Not Valley.{NextPage_49}
We came to live out the rest
of our lives in peace and comfort.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_2}......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_2}Ahh...
It's no fun getting old.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_2}What do you want?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_2}Leave me alone if you don't need anything.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_97}And a good morning to you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_97}Hello there!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_97}And a good evening to you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_97}And a good evening to you!
But what could you
be doing out so late?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_97}Ah, {CharName_0}.
Good evening.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_97}Ah, {CharName_0}.
Good to see you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_97}What are you doing at this hour?
Goodness me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_97}Ah, {CharName_0}.
Imagine meeting you here!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Eh? Is that for me?
{50_18_0_3}How wonderful! That's my favorite.
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_96}{50_18_0_3}{34_1_96}This is my lucky day!
Thank you so much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_2}Oh, I see...
That's too bad, but I understand.
Don't worry about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, my!
This is my favorite.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Goodness... that looks splendid.
{50_18_0_3}Eh? Are you giving it to me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
I really can't help myself
when those are around...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_9}Well, ah...
I'm sorry, but I don't much
like those, you see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I liked them when I was younger, but
as you get older, your tastes change.
Sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not really
interested in that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm afraid I still don't like them.
Sorry about that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, my! How cute!
Animals certainly are relaxing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_97}What a little darling!
Maybe we ought to get a pet
ourselves.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_97}And what kind of seed is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know what kind of seed it is,
but I know you'll grow it well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you grow that on your farm?
It looks so fresh and tasty...
You can always share them with me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, does that look delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
From your farm, right?
It looks nice and fresh.
It must be very good milk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Old and new bones need milk's calcium.
We must not forget that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_96}{34_1_96}That dish looks delicious!
{50_18_0_3}Is--is that for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
How delectable!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah, a hoe?
Well now, I wouldn't know
the first thing about that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you off to tend your fields now?
Don't work too hard.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It must get easier to use the
more practice you get with it.
But not for an old woman like me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah, a sickle?
Well now, I wouldn't know
the first thing about that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This may be common sense
but you're better off not swinging
that thing around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That reminds me of my
husband's watering can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you use that watering
can on bonsai, too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What on earth is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah, so that's a milking machine?
That must be how you get such
delicious milk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are... clippers, right?
You be careful with those.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you shear sheep with those?
Just be careful, all right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And what is this?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Tools get easier to handle
the more you use them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I may be an old woman now,
but I still love jewels.
What kind of stone is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a mysterious stone.
I bet it's a very expensive
and fancy jewel in the rough.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_96}Oh, my!
Why, how wonderful!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And where did you find that?
I'm so excited.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And what kind of plant is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't quite understand the details.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What could that be?
Some kind of giant cookie?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you going to do with
a giant cookie, anyway?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What could that be?
Some kind of seasoning?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going to use that to
cook something delicious for me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}What a strange sound.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}It's quite an interesting sound--
where on earth did you find that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that some sort of medal?
Wait... have I seen that before?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I certainly don't know anything
about any medals.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah, a necklace!
I'm afraid it's not my style, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It might suit me nicely if
I were a little younger.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What book do you have there?
It's simply full of symbols...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Aha, is that used in music? What do they
call it...? Sheet music?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Say, is that some sort of bomb?!
A-are you some sort of nutcase?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Fireworks, you say?
Now, that's quite enough.
You'll give me a heart attack.!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Eh? Are you giving it to me?
Oh, no, that's all right!
It's the thought that counts.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_96}Eh?
Is that a present for someone?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We used to live in the city. We
came to Forget-Me-Not Valley in our
old age for a more leisurely life.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My husband is stubborn and cranky, but
he really does look after me.
I'm a very lucky woman.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've been taking care of my husband ever
since we came to Forget-Me-Not Valley.
And I'll keep doing it, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_3}The last thing you gave me
was truly delicious.
Thank you so much!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_2}The last thing you gave me...
well, it's not really my favorite.
I'm sorry about that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That {29_0} you gave me
was, well...almost delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That {29_0} you gave me
was pretty tasty.
I'm looking forward to the next one.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That {29_0} you gave me
was the best I'd tasted!
Good work!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That {29_0} you gave me
was one of my favorites.
Good work!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me...
I don't know what kind it was, but
I'm afraid it's not to my taste.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me...
I don't know what kind it was, but
it was pretty tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_10}That milk you gave me...
I don't know what kind it was, but
it was rather yummy. Thank you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_3}That milk you gave me...
it was just about the best I've had!
Good work!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me...
I don't know what kind it was, but
it was a little smelly.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me...
it wasn't half bad, actually.
It was a little smelly, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_10}That cheese you gave me...
I don't know what kind it was, but
it was really delicious! Thank you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave me...
You made that?
It was delicious!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_10}That butter you gave me...
I don't know what kind it was, but
it was really delicious! Thank you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter you gave me...
You made that?
It was delicious!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_10}That cooking of yours
was pretty tasty.
Thank you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_10}The last one you gave me
was quite tasty. Thank you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're working hard every day,
aren't you. Good job!
You certainly are reliable.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you used to working on the farm yet?
It must still be difficult, but if
you work hard, you'll be rewarded.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Seems like we've been here forever...
Forget-Me-Not Valley really is a
lovely place.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can really feel how good this
place is--I could live here forever.
Even though there's not much to do.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like Forget-Me-Not Valley so much,
I'll live here for the rest of my days.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Relax and take it easy, all right?
Not that there's much to do.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm afraid I'm not much
of a hostess.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can really relax here.
Life is good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you like it here, too?
That's good to hear.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_10}This time of year, I remember
when my husband and I came here
to Forget-Me-Not Valley.{NextPage_49}
The flowers were blooming
so beautifully.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's easy for old folks to live in a
laidback place like Forget-Me-Not Valley.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Goodness, it's hot... still, summer
in Forget-Me-Not Valley isn't as bad
as it is elsewhere.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, it certainly is hot.
Us old folks really feel it, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is the best season for us old folks.{NextPage_49}
That reminds me.
Have I ever told you
about the dream I had?
{41_2_0}Yes
Not yet
----------x----------
Lately I've been feeling
kind of lonely.
Maybe I'm just getting old.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Goodness, it's cold...still, winter
in Forget-Me-Not Valley isn't as bad
as it is elsewhere.{NextPage_49}
That reminds me.
Have I ever told you
about the dream I had?
{41_2_0}Yes
Not yet
----------x----------
You certainly are
doing well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_10}My, but isn't little Hugh cute!
He may be a little mischievous, but
that's part of his charm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_10}Hugh always reminds me of my
grandson back in the city.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_10}Hugh is as cute as my own grandchild.
He's the apple of my eye!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know those tools Van
brings by sometimes?
They're affordable and good quality.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you often buy from Van, too?
I don't know what Forget-Me-Not Valley
would do without him.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Vesta always comes by to
drop off things for us.
It's a real lifesaver.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Vesta often comes by to
drop off things for us.
We're so grateful.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry, but could we
make it another day?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's really coming down.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Days like this have a certain
character.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A fight between a turtle and a human, eh?
I'm not going to lose!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_7}I won!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
 {32_0_200}.{32_0_200}.{32_0_200}.{32_0_200}Phew...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_3}Oh, it's you.
I have something interesting
to tell you.{NextPage_49}
{50_18_0_0}Do you know how to
make {13}Marinade{17}?
{41_2_0}Yes.
Teach me.
----------x----------
Oh, all right.
{50_18_0_9}I was looking forward to
teaching you, though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_3}All right, I will!
Are you ready?{NextPage_49}
Use a Fish, a {13}Tomato{17}, and {13}Mugwort{17}.
Try a {13}Turnip{17} instead of a {13}Tomato{17}, too.
It's really easy--give it a shot!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{13}Marinade{17} is Galen's favorite dish.
Make sure you let him try it
once you've mastered the recipe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, all right.{NextPage_49}
It was a truly strange dream, too.
Harvest Sprites and that ♪Mr. Pots♪
business. What could it mean?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_18_0_10}Ah, good, good!
I had a very strange dream indeed,
around the end of winter.{NextPage_49}
4 tiny fellows appeared in this dream...
a red one, a blue one, and a yellow one.
They must have been Harvest Sprites.{NextPage_49}
They led me to their home, to a
jug of sorts they kept there.
♪Please Mr. Pots!♪ they said.{NextPage_49}
I don't know for sure, but they must
have been trying to tell me something...{NextPage_0}
