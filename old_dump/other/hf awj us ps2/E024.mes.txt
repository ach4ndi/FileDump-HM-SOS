Another day of searching...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

beard until I found him{u_0086}{2d} but
it's gotten so long...{NextPage_49}
Has anyone seen my Miya?{NextPage_0}

a walk{u_0086}{2d} just like I always did...{NextPage_0}

----------x----------
It's a long story.{NextPage_49}
I was once a man's pet. He would
hug me every day.{NextPage_49}
And somewhere along the line
I learned to talk.{NextPage_49}
Believe it or not! ☆{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But one day when my {u_0086}{_2e}father{u_0086}{_2e}
was taking me for a walk{u_0086}{2d}
we got separated...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Of course{u_0086}{2d} my relationship
with my father always was
a little complicated...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
What?!
But how?!{NextPage_49}
How do you know my name?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Am I famous or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No no.
Actually...{NextPage_49}
.......................
........You see?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So Father has been looking
for me all this time...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He promised he wouldn't
trim his beard until
        he found you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm...
I guess about 10 years have
passed since then...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
(10 years?!
Unbelievable!!){NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm...{NextPage_49}
If Father is that upset{u_0086}{2d} I
don't mind going back.{NextPage_49}
But I don't want to leave
the friends I've made here...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

Old Beardy will be very happy.{NextPage_0}

friends. I want to take them
with me.{NextPage_0}
