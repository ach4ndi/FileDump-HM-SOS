\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136You're a farmer, aren't you,\u2328\u232a?\u2328\u232bFarming seems like a mighty\u2328hard job.\u232bYou've got to look after\u2328all those crops as well as\u2328your animals.
\u2332 It's a lot of work.\u2328 It's a breeze!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136I'll bet!\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136And yet I never hear a peep\u2328of complaint out of you.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136You're pretty amazing,\u2328\u232a!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Goodness knows I have my\u2328hands full just looking\u2328after the animals.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136They are sweet things,\u2328though, so I don't mind!\u2328
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136You like horses, don't you?\u2328
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Next time I'll have to show\u2328you my favorite horse!\u2328She's a real sweet thing!\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136That's a promise!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136I do have a mighty fine\u2328time talking with you,\u2328\u232a.\u232bWe should talk again\u2328soon! I'll see you later!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4a\u2136Is that so?\u232bWell, you can't be taking\u2328your work seriously if you\u2328think that.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Why, I myself only take\u2328care of our animals...\u2328\u232bBut it's a lot of work\u2328keeping them all happy\u2328and healthy.\u232bAnd plants have got to need\u2328just as much love and\u2328attention.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4b\u2136So if you were really doing\u2328your job, I don't think\u2328you'd say it was a breeze.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Sorry for jumping all over\u2328you like that. Maybe it's\u2328none of my business.\u232bBut I had to speak my mind.\u2328\u232bAnyway, it's getting late,\u2328so I do believe I'll head\u2328home. Bye, \u232a.
