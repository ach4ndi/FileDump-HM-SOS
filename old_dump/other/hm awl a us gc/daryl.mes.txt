Hmmm.{32_2_188}
Ah...{32_2_188}
I see.{32_2_188}
----------x----------
{36_1}{34_1_100}! !{32_5_220}{36_0}{NextPage_49}
O-oh, it's you.
Don't scare me like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What was I doing, you ask?
I don't normally tell civilians about
my research, but...{NextPage_49}
...Very well.
I'll make an exception for you.{NextPage_49}
There have been a number sightings of
a strange creature in this area, so
I'm looking into the matter.{NextPage_49}
From what I can tell, there does
seem to be a humanoid creature
lurking in these parts.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}I think I have determined the identity
of the mysterious creature, but I'd like
to capture it and conduct some tests...{35_0}{32_7_8}
----------x----------
{34_1_100}? ? ?{32_5_220}
What's the matter?
You seem a rather pale...{32_3_232}
----------x----------
Aaaaaaaaagggggghhhhh!{32_7_208}
----------x----------
It-{32_1_144}it-{32_1_144}it-{32_1_144}it's here!!{32_1_144}
----------x----------
Hmm. Yes, very interesting...{32_1_244}
----------x----------
Yes, I see!
So children do that, do they! Fascinating!
This data is most interesting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh!{32_1_144}
----------x----------
I-I'm not doing anything suspicious,
really!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have no interest in studying
the behavior of children!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah!{32_1_144}
----------x----------
Owowowow!{32_1_144}
----------x----------
I don't understand it.
How could my secret have gotten out?{NextPage_49}
My research should have been perfectly
secure...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{36_1}{34_1_100}! !{32_5_220}{36_0}
O-oh, it's you.
Don't scare me like that.{NextPage_49}
I thought for sure you were a spy, here
to steal my ideas for my inventions.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Listen.
I invented the {Location_43_0_23}, but
a copy of it is for sale in town.{NextPage_49}
Someone must have stolen my
idea.{NextPage_49}
Of course!
I'll give my {Location_43_0_23}
to you.{NextPage_49}
If you use it, it'll prove how wonderful
my {Location_43_0_23} really is!{NextPage_49}
Now that that's decided, let's
get to work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm studying lightning at the moment.{NextPage_49}
Listen, according to my calculations, we
can collect enough energy to power the
town for a year from a single strike!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
As a part of this plan, I have to perfect
an electricity storage facility that can
store one month's worth of energy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes yes!{NextPage_49}
That's it!{32_1_244}
Keep storing the energy
in the lab's underground battery!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oooh!{32_0_100}
Wonderful!!{32_0_100}
Such power!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......?!
Ug{32_0_100}gg{32_0_200}gg{32_0_200}gg{32_0_200}ghhh!{32_0_200} It tingles!{32_1_144}
----------x----------
Hmmm...
It looks like it still needs work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{41_2_0}Run away.
Stay here.
----------x----------
{34_1_100}{32_5_220}Oh, it's you.
Did you need something?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Nothing in particular.
Ask what he's doing.
----------x----------
I see.
Then you should be on your way.{NextPage_49}
I'm about to start a very important
experiment.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm currently researching solar batteries.{NextPage_49}
If we could capture energy from the sun,
we would have pollution-free power to run
this whole village - no - the whole world!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
In order to do that, I have to perfect
a solar battery that can be used to
power the town.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_101}{32_1_244}And this is the heart of my invention!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're quite lucky.
Not everyone witnesses a historic
moment like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All right, here we go!
Switch... ON!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All riiiiight!
Voltage steady... Output increasing!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_100}{32_5_220}.......Hmm?
This isn't good!{32_3_232}
----------x----------
I guess I blew a fuse.
Don't worry.
It'll switch over to the generator soon.{32_3_232}
----------x----------
Oh, it's you.
Did you need something?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Nothing in particular.
Ask what he's doing.
----------x----------
Hey, where are you going?
Listen to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm studying our water supply.{NextPage_49}
This town's drinking water comes
mainly from underground sources.{NextPage_49}
But even these
won't last forever.{NextPage_49}
After all, most of the water
from this underground spring
flows out to the sea.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So I got to thinking...{NextPage_49}
If we had a giant water tank that could
store rainwater, we could fulfill all of
our needs and the next town's needs too!{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
Of course, rain water has some harmful
substances in it, so you can't drink
it directly.{NextPage_49}
But if I can perfect my underground
water purification system,
we will have all the water we need!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_101}{32_1_244}This is the device!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're quite lucky.
Not everyone witnesses a historic
moment like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, it's you.
You came at just the right time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come here for a minute.
{41_2_0}I've got some business to attend to...
No.
----------x----------
Now now, it's no imposition.
It won't take long anyway.{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Maybe just for a minute...
No.
----------x----------
Oh come now.
It shouldn't take long.{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Maybe just for a minute...
No.
----------x----------
Now listen.
I'm currently researching a way to prevent
global warming.{NextPage_49}
As I'm sure you know, we breathe in
oxygen and breathe out
carbon dioxide.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The oxygen in the earth's atmosphere is
created by plant photosynthesis.{NextPage_49}
But as the forests are cut down, the
oxygen decreases and the carbon dioxide
increases, resulting in global warming.{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
So I got to thinking...{NextPage_49}
If I could just convert carbon dioxide to
oxygen, I could put an end to global
warming overnight!{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
I'm researching ways to recycle consumer
electronic devices.{NextPage_49}
Normally when a device like this breaks,
we take it to a garbage dump.{NextPage_49}
But the available land for garbage dumps
is rather limited, right?{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
So I got to thinking...{NextPage_49}
If we could break up these broken devices
into parts and then divide those into even
smaller parts, they could be reused.{NextPage_49}
It solves two problems--there's less
garbage and lower prices for new things.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmmmm...
It looks like it will take more energy
than I expected to power this device.{NextPage_49}
This will end up costing more than we
save by recycling...{NextPage_49}
I guess my plan still needs a
little work...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're quite lucky.
Not everyone gets to witness...{32_2_88}
----------x----------
{34_1_100}What? Hey!{32_5_220}
----------x----------
Hey! Where do you think you're going?
You'll miss the big event!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Heh, heh, heh.{32_1_144}
Ha, ha, ha, ha!{NextPage_49}
At last...{32_1_44}The time has come at last.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You wretched cow, my hated nemesis...
Soon I shall have my revenge against you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now let's see, which one will I use
for my experiments first...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
La♪ La♪ La♪
Ladedum♪ Ladeda♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder which cow would be best...
La♪ La♪ La♪{32_3_232}
----------x----------
{36_1}{34_1_100}!!{32_5_220}{36_0}{NextPage_49}
Y-y-y-you!
I w-wasn't doing anything suspicious
at all!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I-I don't have anything against your cows.
I was just passing by.... Yes...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I-If you have some free time, feel free
to stop by my laboratory.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I sure do love animals...
They're so c-cute... Really.
Take this cow, for example...{32_3_232}
----------x----------
I'll...{32_0_200} I'll be...{32_0_200} killed!!{32_3_232}
----------x----------
Hmmmmm.
Hmhmhm...{32_3_232}
----------x----------
Whyyyyyyyyy!!{32_3_232}
----------x----------
Whhhhhhhhhhhyyyyyyyy!!{32_3_232}
----------x----------
It doesn't make sense.
Something's definitely wrong.
My research should have been secure!{NextPage_49}
How is the information getting out?!
Hmmmmmmmmmm....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{36_1}{34_1_100}!!{32_5_220}{36_0}
O-Oh, it's you.
Don't scare me like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought for sure you were a spy, here
to steal my ideas for inventions.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Listen!
The {Location_43_0_23} I invented is
for sale in the town!{NextPage_49}
Someone had to have stolen my
idea.
This is most unpleasant...{NextPage_49}
I have to think of some way to make the
world understand how fantastic my
{Location_43_0_23} is.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've got it!
I'll give you the {Location_43_0_23} that
I made.{NextPage_49}
If you use it, it'll prove how wonderful
my {Location_43_0_23} really is!{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
Great! Now that that's decided,
let's get to work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All right!
It's finished.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well then, I have to return to my lab.
I have so many inventions that need
be tended to!{NextPage_49}
Take good care of my invention!
I hope it serves you well!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And here too...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}I was caught off guard last time, but
nothing is going to stop me from capturing
that walking carpet for my experiments!{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{36_1}{34_1_100}!!{32_5_220}{36_0}
O-oh, it's you.
Don't scare me like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What was I doing, you ask?
Well, all right.
I'll tell you, but just because it's you.{NextPage_49}
I am about to capture that shaggy beast
that I ran into a while back.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}If my calculations are correct, he should
be getting hungry about now, so he'll
almost certainly fall for my bait!!{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}{50_19_0_3}My plan is to lure him to my lab and
while he's distracted by the bait, I'll
zap him with a little electric shock!{NextPage_49}
{50_19_0_0}A little plan I like to call...{32_2_188}
{34_1_101}{32_2_188}“Operation: Fuzz Zapper”!
I thought of that myself...{NextPage_49}
{50_19_0_4}Hahahahaha!{32_2_188}
It's so perfect!{32_2_188}
Even if I do say so myself.{NextPage_49}
He's as good as captured.
My chances of failure are less than one
in ten-thousand!{NextPage_49}
Heh heh heh!{32_1_144}
Wahahahaha!{32_1_144}
{34_1_99}{32_5_220}I am a genius!{NextPage_49}
Ugh.{32_1_144} Whew.{32_1_144} I got a little
too excited there...
So much for my calm and rational image.{NextPage_49}
Once I have him safely in custody, I'll
show you something extraordinary.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_0}{34_1_100}???{32_5_220}
What's happening?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_4}W-w-w-{32_1_44}what are you doing?!{NextPage_49}
I went without lunch for a week to pay
for this plan!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How could this happen?!
Everything's ruined!{NextPage_49}
Grrrrrr...
There's nothing to do but go home and
come up with another perfect plan!!{NextPage_49}
That little...{32_1_144} I'll get it next time...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today I'll definitely catch that
walking carpet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}What was I doing, you ask? Very well.
I don't normally share my plans,
but I'll make an exception in your case.{NextPage_49}
Last time, an unforseeable accident caused
my plan to fail, but today I will
definitely capture that shaggy beast.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Taking my last failure into account,
I carefully choose a new and tasty bait
for this operation.{NextPage_49}
According to my research, this creature
seems to prefer raw foods.{NextPage_49}
In addition it seems that he will only
react to freshly picked vegetables or
freshly caught fish...{NextPage_49}
Hey, those sound pretty good...{NextPage_49}
Anyway!{32_3_232} There is a 120%
chance of the hungry wretch being
snared in my trap!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}{50_19_0_3}I'll lure the beast to my lab with its
favorite foods and while it's distracted,
I'll give him a shock!{NextPage_49}
{50_19_0_0}I like to call this plan...{32_2_188}
{34_1_101}{32_2_188}“Operation: Hairball”!
That's got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?{NextPage_49}{35_0}
----------x----------
Oho! He's caught already!{32_2_188}
----------x----------
{35_2}Look! {32_1_44}It's perfect!{32_2_188}
I've outdone myself with this one!{NextPage_49}
{50_19_0_4}Wahahahaha!{32_2_188}
That hairy creature is as good as mine!{NextPage_49}
Hahahahaha!{32_1_144}
{34_1_99}I am {32_5_220}a genius!!{NextPage_49}
Ugh...{32_1_144} Whew. {32_1_144}Maybe I should
switch to decaf...{NextPage_49}
Anyway, it cost me a month's food budget,
but I did it.{NextPage_49}
You have no idea how hard it was for me to
get the special bait I'm using.{NextPage_49}
I have to make this plan work if I'm
going to say goodbye to peanut butter and
jelly sandwiches three times a day!{NextPage_49}
What'll I eat once I make my fortune...?
Now THAT'S my REAL concern...{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_100}{32_5_220}Uh-oh! This'll never do.
I have to hurry up and set the trap...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_4}W-w-w-{32_1_44}what are you doing?!{NextPage_49}
My super-deluxe plan that I spent a
month's food budget on is ruined!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How could this happen?!
I don't have any backup bait!
There isn't enough to lead to the lab!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Grrrrr....
There's nothing to do but go home and
once again come up with a perfect plan!{NextPage_49}
Grrrrr...{32_1_144} I was so close...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This time nothing will stop me from
capturing that walking carpet!
Nothing, I tell you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}What was I doing, you ask? Very well.
I don't normally share my plans.
But I'll make an exception in your case.{NextPage_49}
Last time I was a hair's width away from
success, but now nothing will stop me
from capturing that mangy beast.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Taking my last failure into account, I've
decided to go with a more affordable type
of bait. You see...{NextPage_49}
My many years of experience tell me that
wild beasts prefer quantity over quality.
He will want to eat his fill.{NextPage_49}
There's no point in giving a dumb animal
expensive caviar or foie gras.{NextPage_49}
This time I'm betting everything on
using a buffet table's worth of bait!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Look!
Just look at all of this food!
These are all my favorites.{NextPage_49}
Even if the plan fails, I'll still
have some good eating afterward!
I could eat it all in the blink of an eye!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.........? Anyway! He should be getting
hungry about now. My chance of success is
150%!{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
{35_2}{50_19_0_3}I'll lure the beast to my lab with my
favorite foods and while it's distracted,
I'll give him a shock!{NextPage_49}
{50_19_0_0}I like to call this plan...{32_2_188}
{34_1_101}{32_2_188}“Operation: Furry Fury”!
Hey, they can't all be good...{NextPage_49}{35_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}{34_1_99}Hohohoho!
Just look!{32_1_44} It's perfect!{32_2_188}
I'm so smart that I scare myself!{NextPage_49}
{50_19_0_4}Hahahaha!{32_2_188}
That furry fleabag is as good as mine!{NextPage_49}
Hahahahahahahaha!{32_1_144}
{34_1_99}{32_1_144}Just as I thought, I am a genius!{NextPage_49}
Ugh...{32_1_144}Whew.{32_1_144} I'm getting a little
too old for this...{NextPage_49}
Anyway, I've spent three months of my food
budget on this grand plan.{NextPage_49}
You have no idea how hard it was for me to
make this much food...
The preparation alone took three days!{NextPage_49}
This plan has to work if I'm to say
goodbye to instant ramen forever!
Maybe I should just eat the bait...{NextPage_49}
What am I saying!
I've got to put out the bait...{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_4}W-w-w-{32_1_44}what are you doing?!{NextPage_49}
My first class super deluxe plan that I
spent three months of food money on
is ruined!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Is that what you thought I'd say?{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Heh, heh, heh. In preparation for this
I put sleeping pills in the bait.{NextPage_49}
In battle, you have to always be two steps
ahead of your enemy.{NextPage_49}
I may have caught something extra, but
my plan is unaffected.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's see now... The sleeping pills should
be taking effect about now.{NextPage_0}

{35_2}Why?!?!
Why doesn't he go to sleep?!{NextPage_49}
Wait -- it can't be!
No matter how distracted I was, I couldn't
possibly have...{NextPage_49}
But that's the only explanation!!{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_99}Ughghghhg!
How could this happen!{NextPage_49}
Instead of the sleeping pills, I
accidentally put in all of the expensive
vitamins I just bought!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've made my prey even healthier than
before, the food is all gone, and so are
my vitamins!{NextPage_49}
Grrrrrr...
There's nothing to do but go home and make
another plan while I eat the leftovers!{NextPage_49}
I may...{32_1_144}have to get a mortgage on the lab.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Darn that pompous fool!
He gets to spend every day with
Flora, working side by side with her...{NextPage_49}
Grrrr. I won't stand for it!
It's indecent, that's what it is!
Why doesn't he go back where he came from?{NextPage_49}
And I hate those glasses of his!
And the way he walks and talks, too!{NextPage_49}
Archeology! Hmph! Talk about a
pseudoscience!{NextPage_49}
He'll make a perfect test subject for
my new Maser Cannon. Mumble mumble...{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
F-Flora!{32_3_232}
----------x----------
{35_2}This guy is unbelievable!
Making Flora cook for him! Terrible!
...............I'm so jealous...{35_0}{32_5_220}
----------x----------
D-drat!
They saw me!
Back to the lab!{32_5_220}
----------x----------
Energy may change form, but
it can never truly disappear from
the universe...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And matter is just a form of
energy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's all.
...Or maybe not...
{CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, where are you going?
I thought I would tell you about
my research...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, why doesn't anybody listen to me?{32_3_232}
My research has the potential to solve
problems faced by the entire world...{32_3_232}
My research might solve the world's
energy problems.{32_3_232}
I may need your help occasionally, but...
Hey, come back!{32_1_244}
I'm not done talking!{32_1_244}
The night is young...{32_7_208}
----------x----------
How could this happen to me! She was one of
the only people to understand my research!{NextPage_49}
I was going to treat her to an expensive
meal when I became rich and famous...
I was looking forward to it...{NextPage_49}
Now my plan is ruined!
Ruined, I tell you!{NextPage_49}

Why don't you play a nice song for
{CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I should be going to bed soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It'll be my bedtime soon.
Would you mind leaving?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is goodbye...
Adios amigo!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um...
I'm going to be going out soon, so...{NextPage_0}

I have to leave now, so...
See you later...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, see you later...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Umm....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like the {29_0}.
How much?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
{50_19_0_3}Oh, really?!
That's fairly affordable...
All right, I'll take it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All right, I'll take it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay... never mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want the {29_0}, but
how much is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
I guess I'll pass today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm researching energy.
Maybe I'll show you my experiments.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry.
Please leave me alone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_3}{34_1_99}Oooooooh!
That's one of my favorite foods.
Can I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_3}Well, thank you very much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I see. Darn.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_3}{34_1_99}Oooooooh!
You've got something good there.
Are you giving it to me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
You've got something good there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't need that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I said I don't need that kind of thing,
didn't I?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_4}Hey!
I said I don't want it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is this your child?
Hmmm... A very interesting face
indeed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder how he will react...
I wonder how he will move...
Hmm? Oh, nothing. Don't mind me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not interested in children...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I haven't researched the behavior
of dogs yet, but they seem to
be smarter than cats...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They certainly are interesting creatures.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cats have some interesting behaviors, but
there is much I don't understand.{NextPage_49}
Maybe they're not thinking anything
at all....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It might be worthwhile to research the
behavior of cats.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like a chicken, both for my research
and for my dinner, but...
No, I suppose not.{NextPage_49}
I haven't been eating well lately...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to make a chicken that
can fly...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A chick, eh? I'd like one for my research
and for a future meal, but...
...No, I suppose not.{NextPage_49}
I really haven't eaten anything decent
in a long time...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear that some chickens will actually
lay golden eggs. It might be worth
researching...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ducks can't keep their own eggs warm.
That's why you have to raise them with
chickens if you want to breed them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a miniature duck?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ducks aren't very interesting from a
research point of view.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not really interested in that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{38_3}.
I don't have time to waste researching
that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey.
What do you expect me to do with that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cheese, eh? I don't like milk, but
I'll certainly take cheese.
Is it OK?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
You can eat cheese without preparation, so
it's good to snack on while I work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't eat butter by itself, so I'll
pass.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't need any butter.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey.
Are you going to give me that egg?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
There are normal eggs and fertilized eggs.
But you only get fertilized eggs if you
have a rooster.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm interested in researching fish, too,
but I'm too busy at the moment.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The fish in this region have a unique
ecology, I hear.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make this food?
I could use a little care package.
Can I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Hey.
Can I have that?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
That food looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I might be able to use that for something,
but I'm really not interested.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey.
I don't research stones.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, that's a record...
You've certainly got some unusual things.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey.
That wouldn't be the song that plays
at your farm, would it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}{50_19_0_9}...It made a sound by itself...
I wonder how it works...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}What an usual drum...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey.
What do you plan to blow up with such
a big bomb?{NextPage_49}
If you plan to blow up my laboratory, you
can just forget it.
I'm sure it wouldn't leave a scratch.{NextPage_49}
{50_19_0_3}It would take more than a little shove
to damage my lab!!{NextPage_49}
{50_19_0_0}.....But more than that might a problem.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey.
Be careful with that thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I live here so I can conduct my
own research.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My research topics are energy and
the behavior of living things.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My goal is to create perfect
clones...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is something I heard, but...
Apparently the farmer from Mineral
Town is quite rich.{NextPage_49}
I wonder if she would
sponsor my research?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear that the farmer from Mineral
Town is quite popular in the town.
But it all sounds a little suspicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's amazing that she raises animals and
also grows those crops. Oh, I'm talking
about the farmer from Mineral Town.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear the farmer from Mineral Town is
an amazing angler.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer from Mineral Town certainly
does walk a lot.
I don't trust her...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer in Mineral Town is ignoring
her farm and spends all her time fishing.
Could this be true?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear that the Mineral Town farmer has
rather bad taste.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the Mineral Town farmer has
three cottages...
Hmph.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey.
I really liked what you gave me earlier.
Bring me some more, okay?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey.
That cheese you gave me was just great.
I'd love some more...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey.
That cheese you gave me smelled a little.
But... I might get to like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey.
That cheese you gave me was good.
I'd love some more...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me
was fantastic.
That's kind of thing I like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That food you gave me was good.
I wouldn't mind some more...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You seem to really be working
hard recently.
I should work harder, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey.
Are you working hard on your farm?
It seems to be doing you good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey.
How's work on the farm?
My research is coming along fine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm researching energy.
I've already developed a system that works
using geothermal energy{NextPage_49}
That's where we get all of our
power from.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you're interested, I'll show you my
research any time.
If your timing is right, that is...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey.
Don't touch any of those machines.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey.
No loitering.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_4}Hey.
I'm busy right now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey.
Be quiet when I'm working.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm thinking right now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mumble, mumble...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't think of any good ideas...
Mumble, mumble...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's so hot these days, I can't think.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It just doesn't work.
Oh, sorry. Just talking to myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've hit a wall with my research...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's cold...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if you could store the energy
from summer and use it in winter...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My mind is clear, but...
My body is cold. Especially my feet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey.
I'm in the middle of a research project
right now, so I'm busy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Scientific research never really ends.
I can't afford to take a break.
So I'm always busy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey.
Don't touch anything over there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey.
I said I was busy, didn't I?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_9}Hmm? Oh, I'm
just taking a stroll.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Carbon dioxide emitted by belching cows
contributes to global warming, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you ever heard of cow
cloning before?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
I see...
I see...
----------x----------
There are so many things I have
still to research.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{38_3}.
I sometimes pass by here when I'm on walks
Don't worry about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm looking for a guinea pig.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I sometimes come to the forest to look
for stuff to use in my experiments.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I sometimes see strange animals around
here but I can never seem to catch them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_9}I-I...N-nothing...
I'm not thinking about anything...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Flora-- Oh, nothing...
Just leave me alone...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{38_3}.
Leave me alone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Huh? How did I end up in such a place?
I was just walking around thinking and
suddenly I found myself here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_19_0_9}No, it's not like that...
Flora and I, we've got nothing to do with
one another.{NextPage_49}
{50_19_0_3}I'm here to see, uhm,... Carter!
Yep, that's it! I'm here to see Carter!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I help you?{38_3}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's nice to take walks around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This requires more research.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what the problem is...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought for sure it'd work this time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I need to do more research.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It was going so well...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whenever you're around, my experiments
seem to fail...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll give this some more thought.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...
...I think I'll pass.
Thanks, maybe next time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear there is someone who won the
horserace 10 times, but so what?
Hmm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear there is someone who won at the
chicken festival 10 times, but so what?
Hmm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear there is someone who won at the
cow festival 10 times, but the cow I'm
going to make will be unbeatable.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear there is someone who won at the
sheep festival 10 times, but the sheep
I'm genetically altering will win it all!{NextPage_0}
