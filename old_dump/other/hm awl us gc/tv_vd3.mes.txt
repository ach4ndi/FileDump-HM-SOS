Mr. Kahn, when did{NextPage_1}you start playing
the Tabla?
Holly: "⃝×☆♪?"{NextPage_1}Kahn: "❤♀☆⃝"
Holly: "When I was 45
years old." {NextPage_1}...Really! Only 3
years ago?
That's an amazing{NextPage_1}about of progress
in such a short time.
Holly: "☆❤⃝×!"{NextPage_1}Kahn: "×⃝❤☆...Huh..."
Holly: "Nah, it was
really nothing." {NextPage_1}...Mr. Kahn, how long
do you practice
each day? {NextPage_1}Holly: "♂×⃝☆?"
Kahn: "♀♂... ☆❤⃝"
Holly: "Hmm, about...{NextPage_1}30 minutes."
...That's quite
short. Well, without{NextPage_1}further ado, let's
all have a listen to
what Mr. Kahn can do{NextPage_1}on the Tabla.

Hello everyone.
It's time for another
Music Moment. {NextPage_1}Today's guest is the
famous composer,
Mr. Minoru Tanaka. {NextPage_1}...Mr. Tanaka, you've
had many hits. Which
song do you{NextPage_1}personally think
has the deepest feel
in its lyrics and{NextPage_1}melody to you?
Tanaka: "Hmm, I'd
have to say it{NextPage_1}was my debut song."
...It was "Walk With
You", right? {NextPage_1}Tanaka: "That's
right. The singer
really tied it all{NextPage_1}together. She's my
wife now, as you
know. {NextPage_1}...Aha, how sweet of
you. Now, let's all
check out "Walk With{NextPage_1}You", sung by our
special guest
himself, Mr. Tanaka.{NextPage_1}.....................
♪Walking with you

gently on us♪
♪I'm so happy to be{NextPage_1}with you.♪

Hello everyone.
It's time for another
Music Moment. {NextPage_1}Today we're doing
a special show
featuring composer{NextPage_1}McCoy G.
When one thinks of
McCoy G, you have{NextPage_1}to think of his song,
"Mistake". Though not
many know this, the{NextPage_1}truth is the song was
originally meant to
be an instrumental.{NextPage_1}McCoy G isn't only
a songwriter, he's
also a virtuoso of{NextPage_1}the Oguracci as well.
It seems that
"Mistake" was{NextPage_1}originally created to
be performed on
the Oguracci. {NextPage_1}Although "Mistake" is
easy to sing, the
real difficult parts{NextPage_1}of the song are
it's incredibly high
tones. {NextPage_1}Although it takes a
great deal of skill
in order to produce{NextPage_1}notes in that range,
when applied to
instruments, the end{NextPage_1}result is quite
pleasing. So, as we
say goodbye for today{NextPage_1}let's all listen to
the instrumental
version of "Mistake".{NextPage_1}Until next time.
Take care everyone!

Hello everyone.
It's time for another
Music Moment. {NextPage_1}Today's guest is the
pianist,
Mr. Chechehof. {NextPage_1}Mary will be acting
as interpreter
for us today. {NextPage_1}...Mr. Chechehof,
when you perform,
your movements are{NextPage_1}quite unique.
Tell us, is that done
intentionally? {NextPage_1}Mary: "⃝×☆♪?"
Chechehof: "❤♀☆⃝"
Mary: "A lot of{NextPage_1}people say that to
me, however it's just
my body moving{NextPage_1}naturally."
...I see. I can
imagine that it's the{NextPage_1}emotion of the song
entering your body.
Mary: "☆❤⃝×"{NextPage_1}Chechehof: "❤♀☆⃝"
Mary: "Yes, you could
say that." {NextPage_1}...Without further
ado, let's listen
to pianist{NextPage_1}Mr. Chechehof. Also
be sure to watch his
motions closely. {NextPage_1}.....................
.....................
.....................{NextPage_1}...We're very sorry.
We seem to have run
into some technical{NextPage_1}difficulties
regarding the
performance. {NextPage_1}You can now
understand how
intense{NextPage_1}Mr. Chechehof's
performance is. {NextPage_1}Chechehof:
"... ♀♂☆❤⃝!!!"
Mary: "I can't{NextPage_1}translate what he's
said, but in any case
he is quite upset."{NextPage_1}...W-we're very
sorry. We'll try
again next time. {NextPage_1}Um... Today's guest
was pianist,
Mr. Chechehof. {NextPage_1}Until next time.
Take care everyone!

you is the leader?
Tess: "Right here! {NextPage_1}That's me, Tess."
...Was it hard to get
the group to agree on{NextPage_1}the leader?
Tess: "Nah, it wasn't
that hard really." {NextPage_1}Cass: "We simply drew
straws to see who."
...Oh, is that so?{NextPage_1}Hmmm...
Bess: "Cass, no need
to be blabbing that{NextPage_1}all over national
television."
Tess: "Easy, easy. {NextPage_1}It is the truth after
all."
Mass: "Our leader is{NextPage_1}awesome. He's the
luckiest person
I've ever seen!!" {NextPage_1}...So, that's the
case, eh?
Bass: "Yeah, the only{NextPage_1}reason we're on this
show is because our
leader pulled your{NextPage_1}name out of a hat,
ya know?"
...A-HEM!! {NextPage_1}I suppose you'll be
singing for us?
Oh, I see that there{NextPage_1}is someone who
hasn't spoken yet.
Moss: "I wanna talk{NextPage_1}too!!"
Tess: "Easy now,
easy..." {NextPage_1}Nass: "Am I on TV?"
Ness: "Hi Mom!"
Cass: "Nobody said{NextPage_1}you could talk!!"
Tess: "Easy now,

Mr. Kahn, when did{NextPage_1}you start playing
the Tabla?
Holly: "⃝×☆♪?"{NextPage_1}Kahn: "❤♀☆⃝"
Holly: "When I was 45
years old." {NextPage_1}...Really! Only 3
years ago?
That's an amazing{NextPage_1}about of progress
in such a short time.
Holly: "☆❤⃝×!"{NextPage_1}Kahn: "×⃝❤☆...Huh..."
Holly: "Nah, it was
really nothing." {NextPage_1}...Mr. Kahn, how long
do you practice
each day? {NextPage_1}Holly: "♂×⃝☆?"

luckiest person
I've ever seen!!" {NextPage_1}...So, that's the
