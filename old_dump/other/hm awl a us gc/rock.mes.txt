{50_26_0_4}................. I hate it when other
people are more popular than me!{NextPage_0}

ERROR
----------x----------
Now now. Don't look so sad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know much about the
piano, but{NextPage_49}
But why do you think music is
written down in the first place?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's right!{32_1_44} Because composers want to
convey the wonderful melodies they've
got inside their heads to a lot of people!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those musical notes are just symbols, just
tools to allow you to enjoy music.{NextPage_49}
I just can't stand by and watch you
let yourself be ruled by notes on a page
when you should be enjoying playing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}That's good!
I'm behind you all the way!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
To women, there's a fine line between
giving advice and preaching.
Be careful.{32_3_232}
----------x----------
Hurry up.
If I don't get some music soon
I think I'm gonna die!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't wait!
I've gotta have some music right now!
In particular, {CharName_27}'s guitar...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The dulcet tones of that guitar are just
perfect for the way I feel now.{32_1_244}
{CharName_27}, {32_1_244}let me buy you a drink.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}{CharName_27}'s guitar is always the best!
Let me buy you a drink!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}{CharName_0} was kidding,
{CharName_3}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}'s being mean today.
Of course she wants to hear it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Right, {CharName_0}? {32_1_244}Right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I forgot about that...{32_1_244}
{50_26_0_3}{34_1_128}Hahaha...{32_1_244}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_7}..........................
..........................
Thanks for everything, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, could you sing something?
For {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's about time for me to go to bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time for me to go to bed,
so could you leave please?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I'm off to bed. Later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to be going out soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to go out now, so if you
don't mind...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, goodbye. Catch a clue next time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}'Scuse me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{CharName_0},
got a second?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}Oh darn.
It looks like you're all sold out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}Hmm...
I guess I'd better come back another time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}Hmm.
I thought you might have something
interesting for sale, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}Don't pay any attention to me, Babe.
I don't have much money, so
I'm just window shopping.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Hmm. I guess there's nothing in
particular that I want here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like the {29_0}, but
how much is it, babe?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G, babe.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Oh, really?
That's pretty cheap. Awesome!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}That's a little pricey.
But, OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Whoa. I guess I'll forget about it then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want the {29_0}, but
how much is it, babe?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G, babe.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Hmm. I'm sorry.
I guess there's nothing here that I
want after all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}Oh yeah. {CharName_0}, was it?
I'm kind of a free spirit, so be sure
and invite me if you do something fun!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_2}Hmmm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_2}I'm just not.
Hmm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}Grr!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}You want something?
If not, then leave me alone!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}Hello.
I hope something fun happens today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}Hello.
What's up?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}Hello.
Now is when the nightlife really begins.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Hey, {CharName_0}.
What brings you out so late?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Hey, {CharName_0}.
Welcome. What brings you here this late?
Planning on sleeping over?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Hey, {CharName_0}.
Welcome.
Should we have a party or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Well, this is a coincidence this late
at night. You're here visiting too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Hey, {CharName_0}.
You here visiting too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, are you giving that to me?
{50_26_0_3}Wow! That's totally one of my favorites!
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}Thanks, babe!
It looks really great.
I'm looking forward to it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_2}Oh, I see.
Bummer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}I love that stuff.
It looks really great.
Of course, I eat it all the time, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_0}Wow, you've got something nice there.
Hey, are you giving that to me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}Thanks, babe!
Cool.
I love this stuff!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}That's totally one of my weaknesses, babe.
Dang, that's awesome.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}Uh, look babe, I don't wanna
get in your face, but... NO. Get it?
That's one thing I just can't stand.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}Ugh.
Keep that away from me, Babe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}What's up with that, Babe?
I certainly don't want it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}Nope don't want that.
To tell you the truth, I hate it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Hey. Cute a little boy.
Or was it a girl?
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}To tell you the truth,
I'm not very good with
kids.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Hey, a dog.
Cute.
Ruff ruff!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like cats, but dogs are nice too.
{50_26_0_9}But dogs are smart.
Some can be a little dangerous.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Hey, cute kitty.
Hmm.
Yep, I sure love cats.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_0}I don't know, I guess the
way cats are selfish reminds me
of women. I love 'em.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}A ch-chicken? I like 'em fried,
with a side of coleslaw, thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}Babe, what's with the chicken?
Why do you keep showing me that thing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}A c-chick?
I guess it's kinda cute...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}It's cute and all, but why are you
showing it to me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}A d-duck?
Hmm. The only thing that comes to mind is
the story of a duck walking into a bar.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}Look, I really don't need a duck, Babe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}What is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_2}What's up with that,
Babe? Why do you show me weird stuff?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_0}Wow.
Milk from your farm, huh?
That's probably pretty tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_0}Yep.
That milk looks fresh and tasty
all right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Did you make that cheese, babe?
I only eat good cheese and that one
looks pretty darn good to me.{NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_3}Can I have it?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Cool. It really looks good.
I guess it's made with good milk, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Did you make that butter, babe?
I only eat good butter and that
looks pretty darn good to me.{NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_3}Can I have it?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Cool. It really looks good.
I bet it'd be good on bread or in
cooking too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_0}Wow.
Is that egg from your farm?
Looks pretty good. All nice and fresh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_0}Yeah, that egg looks good all right.
Do you like 'em scrambled or
sunny-side up?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Wow, like... a fish.
I could take 'em or leave 'em.
I'll eat it if it's served to me anyway.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}I guess fish can be pretty
good if you fried it up. Maybe a little
tartar sauce on the side.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Hey babe, you like fishing?
I guess a lot of famous stars fish.
Hey, maybe it's cool now?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Hey, that looks pretty good.
{50_26_0_3}Is it for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Hmm. Looking at that food
makes me feel kinda hungry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}That's some kinda farming tool, huh?
Sorry, doesn't go with the whole image
I'm working on.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}You think I got dressed up like
this just to sweat like a pig working
in some field? Nope.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you really think a girl should be
waving something like that around?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to see you use that to water
some flowers or something.
Something nice and feminine for once.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}...Is that some kinda dairy farming thing?
Sorry, doesn't go with the whole image
I'm working on...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Is that some kinda dairy farming thing?
Sorry, it doesn't go with the whole image
of you that I'm working on.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's not like I hate animals or anything,
but I'm not taking care of 'em. No way.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}That looks brand new.
You like getting new stuff too, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}New stuff is always fun to get,
but sometimes it can be hard to figure out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}You've used that a fair amount.
Pretty used to it now, are you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}You've used that quite a bit.
About the only tool that I use a lot is
my comb.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Wow.
You must really like that tool, babe.
You've used the heck out of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Yeah, I guess you must be
pretty attached to that thing, but if it
were me, I'd buy a new one.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_0}Hey, that's a pretty unusual stone. If
it's a jewel or something, I'll take it.
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}You're really giving it to me?!
{50_26_0_3}Thanks, babe!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_1}If I made it into a necklace or something,
I bet some girl would just love it.{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Hey, what is that, babe?
It looks kinda interesting. Can I have it?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
Are you collecting things like that?
Me too!
I guess we have something in common.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks interesting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}What is that, some kinda wild plant?
What do you plan to do with that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those grow all around here, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What about it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Hey, that's a record, right?
You've got some unusual stuff, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}What kind of record is it?
If it's rock, I definitely want to hear it.
{34_1_128}After all, my name is Rock...{NextPage_49}
Although I do like rap, reggae and
house...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}I'd like to listen to records, too,
but we don't have a record player.
----------x----------
Hey, that's one of Mom's spices, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can make some great dishes with that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You got that from Mom, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}Hmm. That's an unusual sound.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}That's a pretty strange drum, babe.
I've seen a lot of instruments, but I've
never seen one like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}Now that I listen to it, it's pretty cool.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_0}Hey, that's pretty cool.
But I'm really more the “earring and
tattoo” kinda guy, you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like jewelry and accessories, but I'm
not interested in medals.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Even you can't make that look good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}That's a pretty unusual necklace.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}That necklace has kind of a
wild design, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's not bad. Not bad at all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Hmm. That's sheet music, but it
looks a little strange.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}I don't know.
That's not normal music.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Hey, is that a firecracker?
I bet it'd be fun to set that off.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_0}Fireworks always go along with fun things
like festivals and parades.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't think you can set off such a big
firecracker around here, babe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a present for me?
Sorry, not interested.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What're you gonna do with that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Tim and Ruby are my Mom and Dad.
{34_1_128}But everybody says that I don't
look like either one of 'em.{NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_9}I guess this is a case of the
apple falling a long way from the tree.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}Hm? What do I do every day?
Well, er... That is... I don't think
most people would understand...{NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_4}To tell you the truth, I'm
secretly planning something major. So I'm
not just goofing off all day or anything.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_0}I suppose I should look into getting
a job sooner or later.
I think I'll make it “later.”{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey Babe, I heard that the farmer
in Mineral Town is
like, really rich...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey Babe, I heard that the farmer
in Mineral Town is really popular.
But I bet she's not as popular as me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard {29_0} from Mineral Town
has shipped every crop there is.
I guess she's a pretty hard worker, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey Babe, I heard that the farmer
in Mineral Town is really kind to her
animals. Sounds like a nice girl.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey Babe, I heard that the farmer
in Mineral Town spends all day just
digging holes. Sounds kinda hard.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey Babe, I heard that the farmer
in Mineral Town is a master angle-dudette. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard {29_0} from Mineral Town
has walked one million steps.
What's the big deal, anyway?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That farmer from Mineral Town sure
has lived a long time. She worked
that farm for more than 50 years.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey Babe, I heard that the farmer
in Mineral Town is ignoring her chores and
just fishes all day. My kinda gal!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer from Mineral Town
likes everything to be in gold.
Pretty cool, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey babe... I heard that the farmer
in Mineral Town has three cottages.
Woah. Probably party palaces, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard they have some amazing tools at
{29_0} Farm in Mineral Town.
Like, what do they do, you think?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}Babe, that thing you gave me
was totally awesome!
Thanks babe! You're all right!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}Babe, that thing you gave me
was totally gross.
I just can't stand that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}Babe, that {29_0} you
gave me was. Not the greatest.
Sorry, Babe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Babe, that {29_0} you
gave me was pretty good.
Feel free to give me some more!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}Babe, that {29_0} you
gave me was fantastic!
Thanks, man! I'd love some more!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}Don't tell anybody, but the
{29_0} you gave me is one of my
favorites. It was amazing! Thanks, babe!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}About that milk you gave me.
Sorry, Babe. It could still use more work.
How about some better stuff next time?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}About that milk you gave me...
Sorry, babe. It could still use more work.
How about some better stuff next time?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_3}That milk you gave me was
pretty good.
Thanks, babe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}That milk you gave me was
just fantastic!
Thanks, babe! I'd love some more!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}That cheese you gave me
was rich and totally delicious!
Thanks, babe! I'd love some more!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}That cheese you gave me was
pretty good.
Thanks, babe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}Hey, you made that cheese you gave
me, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}That butter you gave me
was rich and totally delicious!
Thanks, babe! I'd love some more!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_2}About that butter you gave me.
Sorry Babe, but it just wasn't for
me, you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}That butter you gave me
was pretty good.
Thanks, babe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}Hey, you made that butter you gave
me, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}That dish you cooked for me
was pretty good.
Thanks, babe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}Don't tell anybody, but the fish
you gave me is one of my favorites.
It was the best! Thanks, babe!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}That fish you gave me
was pretty good.
Thanks, babe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}Don't tell anybody, but the wild
plant you gave me was one of my favorites!
It was the best! Thanks, babe!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}That wild plant you gave me
was better than I thought it'd be.
Well, it wasn't bad anyway.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}That thing you gave me
was better than I thought it'd be.
Well, it wasn't bad anyway.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}You're working hard every day, huh?
So you're a successful farmer now?
How about buying me a drink then?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}You're working hard every day, huh?
I hear you're concentrating more on crops
than on dairy products.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}You're working hard at cooking, huh?
Everybody says you're pretty good.
You should really open a restaurant.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}I hear you're working hard every day.
You do look somehow different these days.
How about buying me a drink sometime?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}I hear you're working hard every day.
You do look somehow different these days.
How about buying me a drink sometime?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}I hear you're cooking a lot every day.
I guess it must be nice to have something
to devote yourself to.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you gotten used to farm work?
{34_1_126}It looks pretty tough.
I know I couldn't handle it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you gotten used to growing crops?
{34_1_126}It looks pretty tough.
I know I couldn't handle it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you gotten used to cooking?
{34_1_126}You want to be a cook
in the future or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}You know, I've been thinking.
If I could just publish a book containing
all of my knowledge about{NextPage_49}
partying and fashion, I bet
it'd sell pretty well.
What do you think?
{41_2_1}Maybe so.
Maybe not.
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}You think so, too?
I think a book like that would be really
popular with the younger crowd!{NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_9}But I guess it takes a lot of money
to publish a book, huh?
I'm practically broke.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_4}What? Why?
I think a book like that would be really
popular with the younger crowd!{NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_9}Well, I guess I knew it wouldn't work.
You've gotta have money to publish a book,{NextPage_49}
and I don't think I could ever finish
writing a whole book anyway.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_2}Yeah, I guess it'd be a waste
to just tell everybody all of my partying
and fashion secrets.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_2}Maybe I could make a line of
clothes that expressed my unique fashion
sense. Yeah, let me think about that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Drink up, babe!
I think we're gonna start dancing
pretty soon!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}My favorite's probably the {13}Mixed Punch{17}.
But I guess everybody likes
that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}Come on, babe! Drink up!
I'll drink you under the table!
Just kidding.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Kick back and relax, babe!
That's my motto.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Make yourself at home.
You want to sleep over?
Just kidding.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_0}It's pretty interesting here.
Don't you think?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You like this place, too?
{34_1_128}I understand.
It's pretty nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}I love this time of year.
Want to go smell the flowers with me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}It sure feels good out.
Maybe I should go hiking or something...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}There are some kinds of activities that
you can really only do in a particular
season. But that can be hard around here.{NextPage_49}
Well, I guess you can go fishing.
You like fishing, babe?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}I'd love to go all out and throw
a big party. But I don't have much
in the money department.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}Whew, it sure is hot.
At this time of year, the best
thing to do is swim at the beach.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}At this time of year, I like to go to
the beach and pick up some pretty girls--
I mean, go surfing. Yeah.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}It's nice to walk outside at this time of
year. Not too hot, not too cold.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}This is a nice time of year.
It'd be even better if I was on a date
with a cute girl. You know what I mean?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}It does get a little chilly at this time
of year. But this is the only time that
you can go skiing or snowboarding.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to go snowboarding.
{34_1_128}I may not look it, but I'm pretty good.
I'm almost a pro freestyle skier, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Woah, you look pretty busy there, babe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}You know, I think people need
some time to just stare up at the clouds
and think.{NextPage_49}
You can get a lot out of it, you know.
Am I being too philosophical for you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}I was just thinking about
fashion.{NextPage_49}
I try to keep up on all the latest trends
and fashions.
And I think I look pretty good.{NextPage_49}
I have an overall theme that I'm going for
with my clothes, so you might not notice,
but I wear something different every day.{NextPage_49}
I make subtle changes to my accessories
and color scheme all the time, but nobody
seems to notice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}I wish something interesting
would happen.
Don't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}You know, I think people need
some time to just stare up at the stars
and think.{NextPage_49}
Well, sometimes I fall asleep and
end up catching a cold while I'm
doing that, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
..............I was just
thinking.........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}You know, that Sebastian...
I've been thinking for a long time
that he wears a rug.{NextPage_49}
There's just something weird, something
unnatural about that hair of his.
I just can't get it off my mind!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_2}I'm eating right now.
Could you make it later?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_2}Look, I said I was
eating, so please come back later.
Really, Babe! After dessert!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}When do you think they're
gonna come and collect this garbage?
They're not gonna just leave it here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}When do you think Cody will
notice me? At this rate, I'll die of
old age before he notices!{NextPage_49}
Think he'd notice if I wrote on his face?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}Woah! I guess Cody finally
noticed me. Heh heh...
That's my best time yet!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_2}..........................
..........................
..........................{NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_4}..........................
..........................{32_3_232}Whew!!
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}Yes! I held my breath for 3 minutes!{NextPage_0}

{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}Yes! I held my breath for 5 minutes!{NextPage_0}

....Yes? Holding my breath?
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_0}No, I was just daydreaming there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}You don't seem to have anything to do.
How about a milk drinking contest?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}All right! Let's do it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}OK then.
Come back when you're ready.
I'll be waiting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}We often have milk drinking contests here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Uh, sorry babe.
I'd better pass for now.
....Just because....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't usually go out on days like
this unless I have to.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe we should find some place
to get out of the rain.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_2}Darn it...!{32_2_188}
You won't beat me next time!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}{34_1_128}Ha ha ha! I win!{32_2_188}
You won't beat me next time, either!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey Lumina.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got good timing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's something I've been thinking
about that I'd like to ask you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's about Sebastian.{NextPage_49}
This is hard to say, but according
to my sources.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He...{32_2_188} He wears a toupee.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've thought a lot about this, and I've
decided that he must be suffering,{NextPage_49}
you know, not being able to tell
anybody about his secret.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So I decided to shave my
head in solidarity with him.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey! Lumina!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's a thin line between advice and
preaching. Be careful.{32_3_232}
----------x----------
Hey! {32_2_188}Hey hey hey!{NextPage_49}
What's this?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Lumina!♪
What're you doing here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Don't talk like that.
You're worried about something, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Aha!♪
I bet it's...{32_3_232}{50_26_0_9} Love problems, right?{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}It's all right!
Lumina!
I won't change my mind about you.{NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_3}Go ahead and say it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}That's simple!
Why don't you just ask somebody?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well...{32_1_44}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you just forget about it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But, {32_1_44}maybe it's better for
you not to know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
In any case,{32_1_44}
They don't seem to want to tell you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's no point getting upset about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Besides, you've got Romana and
Sebastian with you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If I were you, I'd stop trying to find out
about the past.{NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_3}And start thinking about the future!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Hmm.{32_2_188}{50_26_0_3}
Yep!{32_2_188} That's good advice!{32_3_132}
{50_26_0_9}How very like me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Whew.{NextPage_49}
I'm quite a catch, if I do say so myself.
Yessirree!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey!{NextPage_49}
Lumina!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The forest?{NextPage_49}
No! I'll take you someplace a lot better
than the forest!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come on, let's go!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's just your imagination!♪{50_26_0_3}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The reason is...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The sea was {32_1_44}calling me!♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're taking me a little too literally.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But being honest about your feelings is
{50_26_0_3}one of your best features!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}Oh, you taking a nap too?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Not exactly.
Heavens no!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Well, whatever.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}Naps are great, huh?
They're good for you, and feel good too.
I just love that drowsy feeling you get...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}I've been thinking. Is there any
point to working?{NextPage_1}I mean, you can have all the money in the
world, but it won't make you happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}I think I'm a lot happier
just napping here than I could be
doing any kind of work.{NextPage_1}Why do people do it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Don't you agree?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Sure.
You're a real piece of work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}I knew it!
I knew you'd understand.{NextPage_1}I guess we're just smarter than the
rest of the world, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}There aren't many people who understand
what it means to be free, like we do.{NextPage_1}You know, I kind of feel sorry for
them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And about that farm of yours.{NextPage_49}
I don't know how you got started with
that, but it's not like you HAVE to do it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They may call this Forget-Me-Not Valley,
but just forget about all that junk!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Wow, I'm making even more sense
than usual.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}It's surprising how sharp I'm being today.{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Yep.
Moron.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Hey, you and I must really have similar
ideas, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}Well, I'm sick of napping.
I guess I'll take a little stroll.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}See ya.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
D-Did you just call me a moron?!
Well...
Uh, um... It takes one to know one! Yeah!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I never expected you to talk to me
like that!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hm?
What is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Women sure are hard to understand.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Hey.
In a bad mood today?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Look, I don't know what happened, but you
shouldn't lash out at people like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}Well, never mind.
I'm about to go searching for
romance.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you come just to see me?{NextPage_1}Wow.
It's tough being so popular.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, what's with the long
faces?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I guess I'll go out for a while.{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Go with him.
Don't go with him.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Actually, I heard you talking earlier.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}It's about Marlin from Vesta's
farm, right?{NextPage_1}He's got it rough.
Nobody seems to want him.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}If you ask me, it's obvious that
he's in love with Celia.{NextPage_1}But since he can't have her, he's
tryin' to put the moves on you.{NextPage_1}Please, allow me to apologize for my
Mom.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}I mean, wouldn't being with me
be like a million times better than
being with Marlin?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}It sure would.
Not so fast, Mr. Ego.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}I'm just kidding.
I can't stand to be tied down by things
like marriage and commitment.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}But you might make it fun...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Hahaha. Did you take me seriously?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}Well, I guess I'll go for a walk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Did you think that'd hurt me?{NextPage_1}Hey, I can figure out that you
like me.
It's written all over your face.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Trying to play hard to get,
are we?{NextPage_1}Unfortunately, that never works
with me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My parents are such meddlers.
They're trying to get you to marry poor
old Marlin?
You have my sympathies.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, be quiet.
Crusher.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK, OK.
I'll get up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}Hey, what're you doing?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}What are YOU doing?
Go home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Me?
It'll take a while to explain.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}Do you want to hear about my
desperate struggle with the Crusher?{NextPage_1}I call it, “Super Rock Vs. Crusher the
ordinary average dog.”{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Tell me!
No thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}I first met Crusher just
a bit ago.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So this is the farm, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}I wonder how much it'd sell for.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, never mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}She'll be surprised.
She won't be expecting the guy she
likes to come visit her like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}Now that I've taken the trouble
to come all the way out here and see her,
she'll certainly cook me dinner.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Hey.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cute.
I like dogs.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Maybe I should get a dog.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}But I'm broke, so...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I guess that's the price of being a
free spirit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder how much he'd sell for...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey!
Settle down!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}Well well.
So this is how you treat me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}All right Crusher!
Just you and me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Would you like to hear the rest?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Hear it.
Don't hear it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}No cheating, now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}All right, here we go!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Rock wins by a landslide.
Well, what else would you expect, really?
I won three times in a row.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Hey, Crusher seems a little perturbed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}I guess I should be heading on then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}See ya.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}But this is where it gets interesting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Well, whatever.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}Crusher!
I'm gonna want a rematch one of these
days! Be ready!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}If you ask me later, I won't tell you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}Crusher!
Keep this between you and me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Hey, why are you so upset?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}Crusher!
I'll definitely win next time!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ha!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}So the time has come at last.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}You're hopelessly in...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}Well, I guess I don't have to say it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}The Blue Feather in my hands
is proof enough of your feelings.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}But just let me say this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}I won't work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}You don't mind that, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Well, there's no backing out
now that you've given me this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}So I guess we're getting hitched.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}A Blue Feather?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}You can't mean...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}Of course.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There're ducks in the pond.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where did they have come from?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe we should keep 'em.
{41_2_0}Keep them.
Don't keep them.
----------x----------
Cool.
Well, we've gotta give them names, right?
What should we name the male?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's too bad.
I guess we should set them free somewhere.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Input_128}, eh?{32_3_232}
OK, what about the female?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Input_128}? All right.{32_3_232}
...We should show them the {Location_43_21_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.......Yaaaaawn....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yawn... Morning. You're up early.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning, {2d}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning!♪ You're up early!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, it's morning!
Time to get up!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...{NextPage_49}
I'm pretty spent, so I think I'm gonna
go on to bed.{NextPage_49}
Night!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Woah! Is that the time?
{CharName_1}, you'd better
get to bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No!
{50_26_0_3}Kids have to go to bed early.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}No!! You've gotta go to bed or I can't
do what I want! Go to bed!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's right.♪ Very good.♪
Say “good night” to Mommy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, it's time for bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_31}Hey, the kid's not home yet?{32_1_244}
..........{32_1_44}All right!{NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_3}I'll go out and look!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, it's really late but that
kid of yours still hasn't
come home.{NextPage_49}
I'm going to go have a look around.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_31}Hey! It's really late!{NextPage_1}{CharName_1} still hasn't
come home, right?{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}{2d}! You don't think
something's happened to {CharName_1}...?{NextPage_49}
{CharName_1}'s just like you...{50_0_0_30}
Pretty irresponsible...
I'll go have a look around!{50_0_0_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}Hey {CharName_1}!
We were worried!{32_1_244}{NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_9}Are you listening, {CharName_1}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}If he's gonna worry me this much,
I won't go looking for him next time!{NextPage_49}
You should pay more attention to
your son's well-being too!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All right...
{CharName_1}, it's bedtime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night ☆ {CharName_1}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh!
It's about {CharName_1}'s bedtime!
We've gotta put that kid to bed!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_64}Hey, have you seen my crackers?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {32_1_244}What's wrong?{32_1_244}
What's with the long faces?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Give up? Give what up?{NextPage_49}
...{32_3_32}!!{32_3_232}
Hey! {32_3_32}{CharName_1}!{NextPage_49}
Asking for money at your age?{NextPage_49}
Well I'm not giving you any.{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Go away.
We're talking about love.
----------x----------
I said I won't give any money and I won't!
Honestly! {CharName_1}'s acting pretty
selfish! I can't believe it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
....{32_1_244}There they are!{NextPage_49}
Now who could've put them here.{32_1_44}.{32_1_44}.
My crackers!♪{32_1_44}
Hoo hoo!♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Aha.
{32_1_244}I thought so.{NextPage_49}
So {CharName_1}'s in love at last.
I was starting to get a little worried.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_64}{50_26_0_3}Dumdumdedum!{32_1_244}
I heard that!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Heh heh...
{50_26_0_9}I guess this is my time to shine.{32_1_244}
Ask me anything!{32_1_44}
{50_26_0_3}I'll tell you what you want to know.{NextPage_49}
But...{50_26_0_1} is the person you like...
{50_26_0_9}......{32_4_176}Kate, by any chance?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}{CharName_1} & Kate, sittin' in a tree!{32_1_244}
{50_1_0_9}But that means that Hugh is
gonna be your rival, right?{32_3_132}{NextPage_49}
....{32_1_244}Don't worry about it!{32_3_132}
Well, Hugh is handsome, great at
sports, and {50_26_0_3}masculine...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_0_0_30}Hoo-Hoo!{NextPage_49}
You can't become a real man like me
overnight! {50_0_0_30}{32_1_244}But...{NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_3}Just do your best. It'll work out!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, you'll become
{50_26_0_3}a real man soon enough.♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_12}A real man...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_31}Omigosh, I forgot!{32_1_244} My favorite show,
“As The Farm Turns” is on now!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Don't talk like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}Let's go do something.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_7}Hmph...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}Sigh...
It'd be a lot of fun, too...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}Oh well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}Is there anybody else?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Hey!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You wanna go someplace and do
something?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}I'm going home.
Are you hitting on me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Not at all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do I look like that kind of guy?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Yep. I'm going home.
What do you want?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}This isn't my day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Well, I can understand you being nervous,
with me coming up and talking to you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is there anybody else?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's nothing here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So I thought I'd teach you some stuff.
You know, about this and that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't make that face.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We've still got our whole future
ahead of us.
Let's enjoy this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, as a rule, I don't carry any
money with me.{NextPage_1}So there's not much we can
do.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know!
There's something interesting we can see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come with me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_7}W-what?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_7}Dead...
{50_26_0_4}Those darn kids. They probably did this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}You heard a story like that
a long time ago, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}That must be it!
I'm like Urashima-taro from that story!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_7}And I could've met the Harvest Goddess...
Sigh...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_7}The only kids living around here are...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}I bet it was that Hugh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}With that cute face of his!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}I can't believe I live in this same town!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My Harvest Goddess...
----------x----------
There are some things that kids
just shouldn't do.
Kids today...{32_3_232} Scary.
----------x----------
What...?{32_1_244}
----------x----------
Hm?
I was just thinking about you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You mind if I join you?
So, what were you talking about?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
!?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...
That sounds kind of tricky...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well,
it's probably better if I wasn't here.
As you were.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}What's your problem?{50_26_0_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Good timing!{32_1_244}{NextPage_49}
I don't know what the deal is,
but {CharName_1} seems really
upset about something.{50_26_0_9}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}I'm doing what I need to do to live.
Taking strolls, taking naps...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}What're you saying? Those are the
most important things of all!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_10}{CharName_1}♪
Mommy's gonna make you all clean!♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_10}Are you clean now?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_5}Why don't you just give the
poor kid a bath!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning!!
It's me. {CharName_26}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry for showing up so suddenly.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've got something I wanna talk about.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Recently my parents have been kinda
nagging me. They say I should stop
goofing off and get a job.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So I thought if I could live here,
everything would work out great!
You love being with me, right?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Yes. Let's farm together.
I think you're mistaken.
----------x----------
Thanks!!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, you'll take care of the actual
farming! I'm not much on work, you know!
See ya!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh...{NextPage_49}
Turning ME down?
You're gonna regret this
sooner or later!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, goodbye!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
Sorry for showing up so suddenly.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's been exactly a year since
you came here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And I've recently realized something
amazing!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're my Juliet!
And I'm Romeo!
It's fate for us to be together!{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Yes. Let's farm together.
I think you're mistaken.
----------x----------
Yes! Juliet, I'll make you happy!
I promise!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This'll be great!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But Juliet, that's not in my script.{NextPage_49}
Wait... turning ME down?
You're gonna regret this
sooner or later!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Goodbye!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}That makes me want to fly like a bird.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Aha!!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}Dad!!{NextPage_1}What's that supposed to mean!{32_7_208}
Man!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I forgot to say one thing...{NextPage_1}Don't get any fatter! You've gotta be
slim, like me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See you, Mom.
I'll be back to eat your cooking.{NextPage_49}
I'm sure you'll be pretty sad to
have me gone, but...{32_7_208}
Hmmm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know.
Geez!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, see you later!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Besides,{32_1_44} you're the second best looking
guy around! After me, of course!{NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_9}{32_1_244}I guess...{32_1_44} you are at a disadvantage{32_1_44}...{NextPage_49}
Your only hope is that you've got{50_26_0_3}
my blood in your veins.
You're a regular thoroughbred!{NextPage_0}
