Hey, {CharName_0}.{32_3_232}{NextPage_1}Got a second? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This {Location_43_38_23}
is still slumbering. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are all sorts
of conditions for the
Harvest Goddess to{NextPage_1}come to the
{Location_43_38_23}{NextPage_128}{_c8}
----------x----------
That's why we have
to collect so many
wonderful things. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Alright!
Let's go get more
wonderful things! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nuthin... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm looking for
wonderful things. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nope, that's not it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's try searching
in a different
location! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_0}! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah, this one is the
keeper of the
forest. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mukumuku is very
smart. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0} should
be friends with
Mukumuku too! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yeah! {NextPage_49}
Now {CharName_0} and
Mukumuku are
friends! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's wonderful when
you get more
friends! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nope, that's
not it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have a hunch it's
gonna be around
here somewhere. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nope, that's
not it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's try searching
In a different
location! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Grow faster! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We're helping the
crops grow! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We're dancing so
that the crops
grow up strong! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nope, that's
not it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have a hunch it's
gonna be around
here somewhere. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's try searching
In a different
location! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_0}! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah, no worries.
It's only {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's it! {NextPage_49}
{CharName_0} should
be friends with this
guy too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hurray!
Now {CharName_0} has
a new friend! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's wonderful when
you get more
friends! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nope, that's
not it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have a hunch it's
gonna be around
here somewhere. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmmm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I know!
A singing voice is
something wonderful!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yeah, keep it up! {NextPage_49}
Let's try searching
in a different
location! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whew...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Still not enough. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Haaa...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Stars are very
pretty today. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish that we could
gather lots of
wonderful things! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Still not yet...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_49}
Today we're testing
to see if the Harvest
Goddess will come to {NextPage_1}the {Location_43_38_23}
or not. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I knew it wouldn't
work...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We need to get more
wonderful things.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've gotta try even
harder this time! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Who is it?{35_0}{NextPage_49}
{35_2}There aren't any
other Harvest Sprites
besides us. {35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}{CharName_0}?{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}I'm Nak.
Nice to meetcha. {35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, for one thing,
the {Location_43_38_23}
must be clean. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Even if the crops by
the fruit trees
pop their heads up, {NextPage_49}
they won't be able
to grow up strong. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, the baby has
grown so big. You
won't need the Calf{NextPage_1}Hatch anymore. So
we'll put it back in
the {Location_43_23_23},{NextPage_1}and take the calf to
the barn.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We already put the
little one back in
the barn. {NextPage_1}That's why we don't
need the Calf Hatch
anymore. {32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
We'll put it away
in the {Location_43_23_23}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
Bring the baby to
the barn. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When the baby is
about to be born,
isolate the mommy cow{NextPage_1}like this.
{CharName_0} has to
do this job.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wanna see the baby
soon!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}!
Trouble!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......
Poor thing...{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
That's what happens
If you don't keep
a close eye on them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}!
We've got a new
friend! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What should we name
this little one? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Input_128}?
That's a good nameâ™ª{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Input_128}
We'll put {Input_128}
into the Calf Hatch. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is mine! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But I'm the one
who found it! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I didn't realize how
wonderful the
{13}Blue Feather{17} is! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ahhhh!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Poor thing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll give it away! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm the one who
gave it away! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can't go to town. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oops, can't go any
farther from there. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can't go any farther
from this point on. {32_1_244}{NextPage_49}
However, if you want
to know what's
happening, you {NextPage_1}should link. {NextPage_49}
Link to "Harvest
Moon: Friends of
Mineral Town"? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
First, turn off the
Game Boy Advance and
insert the Game{NextPage_1}Pak. Connect the
Game Boy Advance
to the Controller{NextPage_1}Socket 2 of the
Nintendo GameCube,
then turn on the{NextPage_1}Game Boy Advance.
You can only link
to data from "Harvest{NextPage_1}Moon: Friends of
Mineral Town". {32_1_244}
Do you want to
link? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
Okay, come again when
you want to link. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, {32_1_244}

to link again. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, what's up?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love interesting
things. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was just thinking
about something fun. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Go talk to Flak too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Go talk to Nic too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're my friend.
That's because you're
a good guy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's good to tell
others about things
that make you happy. {NextPage_1}You should share
your happiness with
everyone. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We were here way
before all these
people moved in. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you take the food
from the forest...{NextPage_49}
Soon they'll be
no more us! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The people of
{Location_43_30_23}
are all quite{NextPage_1}interesting, so visit
them as often as you
can. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, that's cool. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't use that
here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We don't want that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We know what that is.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The flowers ask you
to take them to
different places? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is a little
baby...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I-is that FOOD!? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So...hungry...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We are hungry too!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This was taken from
your farm?
Great job!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, it really did
get big didn't it!
It's gonna be sooo
yummy!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's best to eat it
when it's fresh!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This was taken from
your farm?
Awesome!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You took good care
of your animals!
That's gotta be good!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a gift from
your animals!
Be very grateful{NextPage_1}when you eat it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What the heck is
that thing?? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now how am I going
to eat that?? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What can I use that
for?? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's wrong?
Is that tree in
your way? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I'll send that
tree back under the
soil. {NextPage_49}
Close your eyes
a second...{NextPage_0}
