I don't like it
when people get
more girls than me! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dummy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't look so sad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't really know
too much about
piano but, why {NextPage_1}are there things
like sheet music?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's it! {32_1_44}{NextPage_49}
The composers wanted
to express their
melodies to many {NextPage_1}other people and
so they made sheet
music! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Music scores are just
symbols and codes. {NextPage_49}
It's not meant for
just enjoyment. {NextPage_49}
That's why {CharName_9}
isn't enjoying
playing the piano...{NextPage_49}
I don't want to
see her like that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}That's great!
I'll always support
you! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There is a fine line
between advice and
a lecture.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hurry up! {NextPage_49}
We need some music
to liven up the
place. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't wait!
I want music
right now! {NextPage_49}
Especially
{CharName_27}'s guitar! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That guitar's tone
really matches me... {32_1_244}{NextPage_49}
Hey {CharName_27},
I'll buy you a
drink. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}No matter how many
times I hear it,
{CharName_27}'s guitar{NextPage_1}is still the best! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}{CharName_0} was just
kidding, {CharName_3}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0} is just
being a moron. {NextPage_49}
He really wants to
hear music today. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that right, {32_1_244}
{CharName_0}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Was that...right? {32_1_244}
{50_26_0_3}{34_1_128}Ha ha ha... {32_1_244}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_7}......
Thanks for
everything, {CharName_0}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, would you
play a song in
memory of {CharName_0}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to sleep
soon so... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Time for bed.
Would you please
go home? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay, I'm going
to sleep now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I need to get out
of here so... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really have to
get out of here... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See ya... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}Hello? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{CharName_0}, can you
help me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}Oh, that's too bad.
You don't have any
merchandise. {NextPage_49}
You must have
sold out. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}I guess I should
come back when you
have more stuff. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}Aw, man.
There's nothing
cool here... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}Don't worry about
me... {NextPage_49}
I don't have much
money, and I'm
just looking anyway. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Ah...
Nothing I wanted
here anyway... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really like
that {29_0}.
How much?
{41_3_2}It's yours for {2a_1_5}G.
{2a_2_5}G.
Not for sale.
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Really!
That's cheap. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I'll take
it then... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}That's a little
expensive, but
it's okay I guess. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_9}That's enough for
me for today... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like {29_0}.
How much is it?
{41_3_2}It's yours for {2a_1_5}G.
{2a_2_5}G.
Not for sale.
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Sorry...
I'm done for today. {NextPage_49}
There's nothing I
really like here
anyway... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}You're uh...
{CharName_0}, right? {NextPage_49}
I'm a free spirit
here, so call me if
you want some fun! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_2}...Hmmm... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_2}I...
Hmmm... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}...Grr! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_4}What do you want
from me !? {NextPage_49}
If you don't need
anything, then leave
me alone! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}It'd be nice if
today was fun too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}Can you find
something fun to do?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}The fun is just
getting started. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Yo, {CharName_0}.
What are you doing
here tonight? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Yo, {CharName_0}.
What's up? {NextPage_49}
Coming to stay over
tonight? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Yo, {CharName_0}.
What's up?
Going to the party? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}What a coincidence.
Are you having fun?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Yo, {CharName_0}.
Did you come to
party too? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}Is that for me?
{50_26_0_3}No way! That's my
favorite food! {40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}Thank you!
I'm feeling pretty
good now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_2}Aww, man...
I'm disappointed. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}I love that.
It looks SO good. {NextPage_49}
I eat it all the
time but so what! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_0}Aww man, you've got
something great!
It's for me right?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}No joke?
Thanks, man!
I love this! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}I'm helpless in
front of that...
You're so lucky. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}I don't really
like that... {NextPage_49}
I'm not picky about
my food, though. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}Oh...gack...
Take it away... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}So?
I'm not interested
in it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}Get that garbage
away from me.
I kinda hate it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Hey, little man.
You're pretty cute. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}You know...
I really don't like
kids much. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Yo, dog...
You may be cute,
but cats are better. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Sorry, I'm not crazy
about dogs.
Cats are better... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}There's a cute
little cat. {NextPage_49}
Yeah, cats really
are the best. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_0}Cats act a lot like
women, don't you
think? {NextPage_49}
Their so willful
and conceited. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}C-chicken...?
Mmm...fried chicken.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}What's up with
the chicken? {NextPage_49}
What do you want me
to do with it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}A chick...?
It's kind of cute
I guess... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}Okay, it's cute,
but why are you
showing it to me? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}A d-duck...? {NextPage_49}
Do you know a story
about an ugly
duckling? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}Why are you bringing
me a duck? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}What's that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_2}Ah... So? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_0}Wow, you brought
that milk from
your farm? {NextPage_49}
It looks really
good and fresh. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_0}That milk looks very
fresh. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Did you make that
cheese? {NextPage_49}
I'm really big
into cheese and
that looks good. {NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_3}Say what?
It's for me?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}That's some really
GOOD looking cheese. {NextPage_49}
The milk must have
been good too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Did you make that
butter? {NextPage_49}
I'm really big
into butter, and
that looks good. {NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_3}Say what?
It's for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}That butter looks
really good. {NextPage_49}
No doubt, it would
taste good on
some bread or if {NextPage_1}you used it while
cooking. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_0}You got that egg
from your farm?
Pretty cool. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_0}Now there's a
good egg. {NextPage_49}
It would probably
make awesome
scrambled eggs. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Fish, huh... {NextPage_49}
I don't hate it,
but I don't like
it either. {NextPage_49}
Well, if you put
it in front of me,
I'll eat it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}Now fried fish,
that's the ticket. {NextPage_49}
Oh and don't forget
the tartar sauce. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Is fishing more fun
than the fish? {NextPage_49}
It takes talent,
right? {NextPage_49}
Maybe it might even
be cool... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}That looks so good.
{50_26_0_3}Is that for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Looking at that
reminds me of how
hungry I am... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}That's...
a farm tool. {NextPage_49}
I'm too cool for
something like
that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't you think I'd
look ridiculous
all sweaty and {NextPage_1}covered in mud and
soil? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}That's a tool for
dairy use right? {NextPage_49}
I'm too cool for
something like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't you think I'd
look ridiculous
all sweaty and {NextPage_1}taking care of
animals? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}That looks really
new. {NextPage_49}
New gear is always
feels good to have. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}It's great to have
new tools, but they
are hard to use. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}You've used that
tool for a while,
haven't you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}You've used that
tool for a while,
haven't you. {NextPage_49}
I guess my most
used tool would
be my hairbrush. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can feel that
this tool has been
used with care. {NextPage_49}
Almost like your
spirit is in the
tool... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}That must have been
used a long time... {NextPage_49}
I'd buy a new one
if I were you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_0}That's an unusual
stone. {NextPage_49}
I'd take it if it's
a gem stone...
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}Is that for me? {NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_3}Thank you!
I'll take really
good care of it! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}What is that?
It's kind of
intriguing... {NextPage_49}
Are you giving
that to me? {40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Plants?
What are you going
to do with that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}A record is such an
unusual thing
in these days. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}What kind of record
is that? {NextPage_49}
If it's rock music,
I'll listen to it. {NextPage_49}
{34_1_128}Of course I like
rock, that's my
name! {NextPage_49}
But I like rap and
reggae too... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Yo, why would you
give that to me? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Is that something
cool? {NextPage_49}
I don't really
know. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_0}It's very pretty. {NextPage_49}
But I think a ring
or earrings has more
style than a medal. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you played
Harvest Moon: Friends
of Mineral Town? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}That's an unusual
necklace. I heard
there is a very good{NextPage_1}artisan in Mineral
Town who can make
great necklaces.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}It's got a strange
design to it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}That's some strange
music you have... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}I'm not too up
on music, but that
looks difficult. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}That's a firework
right? {NextPage_49}
That looks like lots
of fun. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_0}When I think of
fireworks, I think
of festivals. {NextPage_49}
They're always
a lot of fun. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a gift for me?
{50_26_0_7}...{34_1_127}It's not? {NextPage_49}
What do you mean
that's for someone
else? {NextPage_49}
Geez... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_9}Hey, give that here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Tim and Ruby are
my parents... {NextPage_49}
{34_1_128}I don't really look
like either. {NextPage_49}
At last that's
what everyone
tells me. {NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_9}...Who cares?
A black hen lays a
white egg, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}What do I do
everyday? {NextPage_49}
I don't really
know myself.. {NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_4}Actually, and this
stays between us,
I working on a {NextPage_1}secret mission
right now.{NextPage_49}
I'm not playing
around all the time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_0}It'd be nice if I
had a set job
everyday... {NextPage_49}
Oh, well I'm sure
I'll come up with
something... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}The stuff I got
last time was
mind blowing! {NextPage_49}
It gave me the
best feeling.
Thanks! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}The stuff I got
last time made me
want to die! {NextPage_49}
I really hated
that kind of stuff. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}The {29_0} you
gave me last time
made me feel weird. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}The {29_0} you
gave me last time
tasted great. {NextPage_49}
I hope you'll
give me some more
next time! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}The {29_0} you
gave me last time
was the best! {NextPage_49}
I hope you'll
give me some more
next time! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}The {29_0} you
gave me last time
was the best thing {NextPage_1}I ever ate in my
entire life. {NextPage_49}
On top of that, it
happened to also be
my favorite food! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}Sorry, but the milk
I had last time
wasn't so good. {NextPage_49}
Can you bring me
some good tasting
milk next time? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_9}Sorry, but the milk
I had last time
tasted bland... {NextPage_49}
Can you bring me
some good tasting
milk next time? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_3}The milk I had
last time tasted
delicious. {NextPage_49}
Thanks a lot,
bro. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}The milk I had last
time was super!
Thanks! Got more?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}The cheese I had
last time was
so rich and creamy!{NextPage_49}
Thanks for giving me
something so good! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}The cheese I had
last time was
delicious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}You made the cheese
I had last time,
right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}The butter I had
last time was
so rich and creamy!{NextPage_49}
Thanks for giving me
something so good! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_2}Sorry but the butter
I had last time was
really bad. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}The butter I had
last time wasn't
bad at all. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}You made the butter
I had last time,
right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}The dish I had
last time was
delicious. {NextPage_49}
Thanks for bringing
it to me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}The fish I had last
time was tasty. {NextPage_49}
It's actually my
favorite dish! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}The fish I had last
time was tasty.
Thanks. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}The wild grasses
that you gave me
were delicious. {NextPage_49}
They're actually
one of my favorite
things to eat! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}The grass you gave
me had a very weird
taste to it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}The food you gave me
tasted weird.
Kinda good, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}You're working
everyday. {NextPage_49}
Feel like a real
farmer yet? {NextPage_49}
Next time treat
me to something
okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}You're working
everyday. {NextPage_49}
You think the field
is more important
than dairy? {NextPage_49}
Either way you look
at it, they're
both important! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}You're cooking
everyday? {NextPage_49}
Everyone is saying
how much you've
improved. {NextPage_49}
Why don't you
open a restaurant
or something? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}You're working
everyday. {NextPage_49}
I can tell that
you're getting
better. {NextPage_49}
Next time treat
me to something
okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}You work out in the
fields everyday? {NextPage_49}
I can tell that
you're getting
better. {NextPage_49}
Next time treat
me to something
okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}You're cooking
everyday? {NextPage_49}
I'm jealous that you
have such drive. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you started to
get the hang of
farming yet? {NextPage_49}
{34_1_126}It looks like it
takes a lot work. {NextPage_49}
I could never
do what you do. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you gotten used
to field work yet? {NextPage_49}
{34_1_126}It looks like it
takes a lot work... {NextPage_49}
I could never
do what you do. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Feel like you've
gotten the hang of
cooking yet? {NextPage_49}
{34_1_126}You know you could
be a cook in the
future... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}I've always known
I had a sense for
fashion and parties. {NextPage_49}
I bet if I wrote a
book about both,
I'd sell like crazy. {NextPage_49}
What do you think?
{41_2_1}Possibly.
Not likely.
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}You think so
too right !? {NextPage_49}
I bet all the young
girls and guys
would buy it! {NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_9}Unfortunately,
I don't have any
way I'd publish it {NextPage_1}since I'm totally
broke. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_4}Why not!?{NextPage_49}
I bet all the young
girls and guys
would buy it! {NextPage_49}
{50_26_0_9}Wait, I know what
you mean. {NextPage_49}
It would take money,
and I've never even
written a book once. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_2}It's a waste to try
and explain my sense
of style to people...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_2}Maybe I should make
my own clothing
line... {NextPage_49}
But how would I
get started?
Hmm... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Want a drink?
You'll feel good
my man. {NextPage_49}
This place is a
jumping party. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}My drink of choice
is the {13}Mixed Punch{17}. {NextPage_49}
Then again I think
everyone likes
that... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_3}Drink up!
Today we'll rock
the valley! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}"Take it easy, man."
Don't wanna hear
that from me? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Make yourself at
home. Do you wanna
stay overnight? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}{50_26_0_0}This place is cool,
don't you think? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So, do you like
this place?{NextPage_49}
{34_1_128}I know, it really is
the best place. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}I love this weather.
It makes me feel
so good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}{50_26_0_0}Maybe I'll go hiking
or something... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}This season is all
about free time. {NextPage_49}
Try to enjoy it as
much as possible. {NextPage_49}
It's not always so
easy to do here
in this valley... {NextPage_49}
I suppose you could
always go fishing,
that's fun. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}Sometimes I just
want to rock the
valley with a party!{NextPage_49}
This hum-drum
everyday life is
too harsh for me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}Wow, it's hot.
Summertime equals
being at the beach. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}When it's this hot
lots of girls like
to go to the beach {NextPage_1}in their very sexy
looking swimsuits? {NextPage_49}
Suddenly I feel
like going surfing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}This season always
feels the best. {NextPage_49}
Not to hot, and
not to cold... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}I love the gentle
Autumn breeze. {NextPage_49}
The only thing that
would make this
better is to have {NextPage_1}a date with a
really cute girl
somewhere. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}Brrr...
It's cold... {NextPage_49}
I know, I could go
skiing or
snowboarding... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want to go
snowboarding... {NextPage_49}
{34_1_128}I may not look it,
but I'm really
good at it. {NextPage_49}
I'm even at a
pro level for
skiing too! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Wow, you look
busy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}Life is filled with
frenzy, but you need
to zone out too. {NextPage_49}
Sometimes just
watching the clouds
is enough. {NextPage_49}
Wow, look at that.
I'm a philosopher. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}I'm thinking about
fashion right now. {NextPage_49}
I always like to
think I have great
style. {NextPage_49}
I think it's hard
to communicate my
style though... {NextPage_49}
Everyday I try to
change things just
a little... {NextPage_49}
Usually one of my
accessories or
something but {NextPage_1}then nobody ever
notices the change. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}What's cool?
Cool is about not
losing your cool. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}Life is filled with
frenzy, but you need
to zone out too. {NextPage_49}
Sometimes just
watching the stars
is enough. {NextPage_49}
You'll have a great
sleep afterwards
I guarantee it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was thinking
about something... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}It's about
Sebastian. {NextPage_49}
I used to think he
wore a wig... {NextPage_49}
Don't you think
his hair is just a
little unnatural? {NextPage_49}
Not like it really
matters, but still...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_2}I'm eating right
now. {NextPage_49}
Can you come back
later? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_2}I said I'm eating
right now.
Talk to me later. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}I wonder when that
garbage is going to
break down. {NextPage_49}
How much longer
can we keep
dumping like this? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}How long do you
think it will take
Cody to notice me? {NextPage_49}
Maybe I should go
and write something
on his face? {NextPage_49}
Then he might
notice me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}It looks like
Cody noticed me. {NextPage_49}
It's a new World
Record! Wow!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

Holding my breath?
{34_1_126}{50_26_0_0}No, I was just
zoning out. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}You look like you've
got some time. {NextPage_49}
Want to have a
milk drinking race?
{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_128}Okay, it's on now!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_126}Oh, well let's do
it when you have
time okay? {NextPage_49}
I'll be waiting
for you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_127}I've done a lot
of milk drink
racing here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry, I can't do
that right now...{NextPage_0}

{50_26_0_2}Arrrgh... {32_2_188}
You won't beat
me next time! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}{34_1_128}Ha ha ha,
I win. {32_2_188}{NextPage_49}
You won't beat me
next time either. {NextPage_0}
