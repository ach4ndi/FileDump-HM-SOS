\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136\u232a, do you like bugs\u2328and frogs?\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Ever since I was a kid, I've\u2328enjoyed hunting for bugs all\u2328day on the mountain.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136How's your work been going\u2328recently?\u232bDon't work so hard that you\u2328end up fainting!\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136You have to balance out your\u2328work with time to rest.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136This is a good place.\u232bI like it here.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Everyone in Konohana is so\u2328kind. I've been won over by\u2328everybody's warm welcome.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Where's your hometown,\u2328\u232a?
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136So is there anything you\u2328really dislike?\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136You don't seem like the type\u2328to really dislike anything\u2328strongly.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136So do you like the village\u2328that you're living in now?\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136It's really awesome, isn't\u2328it?
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Konohana has such clean\u2328water.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136And when the water is good,\u2328the food is good!
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Everyone in Konohana is so\u2328kind.\u232bWhenever I have a problem,\u2328everyone helps me out.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136What's your hometown like,\u2328\u232a?\u232bMy hometown is very bustling\u2328with windmills spinning all\u2328over the place.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136So is there anything you\u2328really dislike?\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136Everybody has one or two\u2328things that they really\u2328don't like.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Did you know that you can\u2328move from here in Konohana\u2328over to Bluebell?\u232bIf you ever want to move,\u2328talk to the mayor.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136This is a nice village.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136It has its own atmosphere\u2328that's not like other towns\u2328and villages.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136People over in Bluebell are\u2328all nice too.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136They always thank me when\u2328I make a delivery.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136My hometown is very bustling\u2328with windmills all over the\u2328place.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Bazaars are held there often\u2328and people come from all\u2328over the world.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136\u232a, take my advice...\u2328When you're going to give\u2328somebody a present...\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136Make sure it's not something\u2328that they hate!
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Did you know that you can\u2328move from here in Konohana\u2328over to Bluebell?\u232bBut you can only move once a\u2328month.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Yo, \u232a...\u2328Don't throw stuff in the\u2328river.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Not that you ever would, but\u2328I'm just saying!
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Konohana's festivals look\u2328really interesting.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136I'd like to take part too if\u2328I didn't have work.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136I've got an idea!\u2328Next time you tell me all\u2328about the festival!
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136\u232a, do you have any\u2328brothers or sisters?\u232bI have an older brother.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136He's very different from me.\u2328He's a good brother, always\u2328looking out for me.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136Do you know how to make\u2328friends with cats?\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136If you do, please tell me...
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Depending on which village\u2328you move to, the number of\u2328animals you can keep varies.\u232bIf you have more than you\u2328can keep, you have to give\u2328the extras to somebody else.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136This is a good spot for\u2328looking out over Konohana.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136I feel like singing!\u2328Do you want to sing with me?
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Everyone is Konohana is\u2328so nice.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Everyone goes around wearing\u2328a smile every day.\u232bIt reminds me of my\u2328hometown.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Mayor Ina is so cool.\u232bThe mayor of my hometown is\u2328very...energetic.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Mayor Ina is different,\u2328but what they have in\u2328common is caring for people.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136I...can't stand static\u2328electricity.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136When I touch a ball of yarn,\u2328I always get a little zap!
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136It's dangerous to go outside\u2328in a blizzard or typhoon.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Even if you wanted to move\u2328on a day like that, you\u2328can't.\u232bIt's too dangerous to go\u2328over the mountain.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Welcome to my house!\u232bMake yourself at home!
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136I work as a deliveryman.\u232bI deliver the mail to people\u2328in the village every day.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136All of Konohana's villagers\u2328get along so well with each\u2328other.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136There's a lot of wildlife up\u2328on the mountain.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136But the animals run away if\u2328you get too close.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136\u232a...\u232bYou're...\u270b\u2328\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136An interesting person.\u232bI get a kick out of talking\u2328to you.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136My job is awesome.\u232bEvery day I get to meet lots\u2328of people and chat with\u2328them!
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Whenever I make a delivery\u2328to Yun's place, she serves\u2328me tea.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136She's a really nice lady.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Georgia and Grady are good\u2328friends.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136You can tell they're close\u2328even when they quarrel!
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136There's a lot of wildlife up\u2328on the mountain.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136You'll see different animals\u2328during different seasons of\u2328the year.\u232bYou should keep an eye out\u2328for them!
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136\u232a...\u232bYou're...\u270b\u2328\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136A nice person.\u232bI feel better whenever I\u2328talk to you.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136\u232a, are you a good\u2328cook?\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136I have confidence in my own\u2328cooking skills!
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136When I make deliveries to\u2328Sheng's house, we get into\u2328interesting conversations.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136But if he starts talking\u2328about pandas, he'll go all\u2328day...\u232bThat guy is completely into\u2328pandas.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Reina and Mako are\u2328funny.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136I've seen both of them\u2328talking to plants on many\u2328occasions.\u232bThe two of them are\u2328completely into plants.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Owls are really cute.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136There are some very rare\u2328animals around here.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136\u232a...\u232bYou're...\u270b\u2328\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136A kind person.\u232bI really respect all the\u2328caring you show for people.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136My delivery job is pretty\u2328physically demanding.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136I have to work out and\u2328get stronger.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Mako usually gives me a\u2328snack when I make a delivery\u2328to his house.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136The fruit he grows is\u2328unbelievably delicious.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Ash and his sister Cheryl\u2328are really close.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f4b\u2136I was never as affectionate\u2328as that toward my brother.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Of course, it's different\u2328between brothers.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136\u232a, have you ever seen\u2328a panda before?\u232bIt's a really rare animal.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Do pandas really eat bamboo?
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136\u232a...\u2328You're...\u232bWhat's the word......\u270b\u2328\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136A wonderful person.\u232bI know why everybody thinks\u2328highly of you.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136I used to have a job at a\u2328caf.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136I tend to make a racket when\u2328I'm cooking and cleaning!
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136The other day at Kana's\u2328house, I saw a big book all\u2328about horses.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136I've been to a lot of\u2328horse-racing events, so we\u2328had a lively discussion.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Kana and Hiro are like\u2328brothers...\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136Or like a ringleader and his\u2328sidekick, don't you\u2328think?
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Alpacas are a very rare\u2328animal in these parts.\u232bThey're kind of strange...\u2328They're like little\u2328llamas.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136But the cutest thing is how\u2328they keep staring at you\u2328once you make eye contact.
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f4d\u2136............\u2328Uh.........\u232bWhen I'm with you, I have\u2328such a good time.\u232bMaybe, if it's okay...\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136...you could be my confidant\u2328from now on?
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136\u2391, how long has it\u2328been since we met?\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136I can lose all track of time\u2328when we're together.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f4d\u2136I want you to be with me\u2328forever...\u232bAnd I know you will!
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136Getting married certainly\u2328does change your outlook.\u232bNow I've got a family to\u2328look out for.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f49\u2136\u2391, I'm still not\u2328the most mature guy in the\u2328world, but stick with me!
\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f48\u2136\u2391...\u2328.........\u232b\u1f41\u1fc0\u1f4d\u2136Thank you for being my\u2328partner in life...\u232bI'll be good to you for as\u2328long as I live!
