\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136I'm so sorry, Dad. I\u2328completely forgot I promised\u2328to help you today.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb5\u1f48\u2135Oh, that's alright, Laney.\u2328I shouldn't have asked you\u2328to help out on your day off.\u232bBut it's not like you not to\u2328come in when you say you\u2328will, so I was worr--
\u1f40\u1fb5\u1f48\u2135Now don't tell me that the\u2328two of you were together!?\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Huh? Yeah.\u232bActually, \u232a\u2328says he wants to help out.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb5\u1f48\u2135Does he, now?\u2328Hmmm...
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136Why are you staring at him\u2328like that, Dad?\u232bYou're making \u232a\u2328uncomfortable.\u232bGo on, get back to work.\u2328There are customers waiting!\u2328\u232b\u1f40\u1fb5\u1f49\u2135So there are. Excuse me.\u2328I think I'll take you up\u2328on your offer to help out.\u232bThank you sooo much,\u2328\u232a!
\u1f40\u1fb5\u1f48\u2135Phew. What a crowd!\u2328\u232b\u1f40\u1fb5\u1f49\u2135I don't know what we\u2328would've done without you,\u2328\u232a.\u232bYou're a natural!\u2328
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136I hope we didn't tire you\u2328out!
\u2332 I'm too tired to move.\u2328 I'm fine. This was fun.
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4c\u2136Really? Farm work seems\u2328like it would take a lot\u2328more out of you...\u232b\u1f41\u1fab\u1f48\u2136Anyway, you were a big help.\u2328Thanks so much.\u2328See you later, \u232a.

\u1f40\u1fb5\u1f49\u2135How about ditching the farm\u2328and working here as\u2328Laney's husband?\u232bIt would be wonderful to\u2328have you here every day!
\u1f41\u1fab\u1f4d\u2136D-Dad!!\u2328Don't say things like that!
