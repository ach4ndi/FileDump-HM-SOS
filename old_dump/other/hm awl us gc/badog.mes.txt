Behold, such a
perfect limb!
Isn't my bonsai{NextPage_1}the best? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No, no, really.
My bonsai is
truly amazing! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You came just at
the right time
actually.{NextPage_49}
Which bonsai do you
think is better? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hah ha ha ha ha!
You got that right!{NextPage_49}
My bonsai really is
magnificent. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmmm!
I lost!? {NextPage_49}
Wait till you see
my true skill! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, I see.
You like bonsai too?
{41_2_0}A little.
Not at all.
----------x----------
Hmm. If that's the
case, it costs 300G
to join my club.{NextPage_49}
You only pay this
one time, so don't
you worry. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There is nothing
wrong with you
right now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But, you can't push
too hard now. {NextPage_49}
Let's both live a
long life. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll be going now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{36_1}What the!?{36_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, it's you.
Don't surprise me
like that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ahhh, this.
Long ago I used this
during surgery. {NextPage_49}
Look at it! Isn't
that a fine blade? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't use it
anymore, but I still
sharpen it.{NextPage_49}
It's pointless to
have something you
don't use, so I'm{NextPage_1}giving it to you.
Here, take it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So long. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey!? {32_1_244}
Are you okay?? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you awake? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks like you
pushed yourself
a little too hard. {NextPage_49}
Lucky for you it
happened in my
house. {NextPage_49}
You'll be fine.{NextPage_49}
This Doctor is
never wrong in his
diagnosis. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah, yes.
You probably already
know this but, I {NextPage_1}just moved here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've got things to
attend to, so I can't
stay and watch you. {NextPage_1}Get home safely. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So sorry...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How can one much
younger than I go
before I do...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {CharName_27}.
How about a song for
{CharName_0}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time for me to
be going to bed...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm very sleepy...
Will you please go
home? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to bed...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I need to be going...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Off I go...
Can you come later?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take care of
yourself...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, come here a
second. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Over here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you don't have
anything...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sold out for today?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you don't have
anything to sell,
close your stand. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nope, just looking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nothing that
interesting... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0}, eh...?
How much you want?
{41_3_2}{2a_1_5}G is OK.
{2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
{50_31_0_3}Hmmm...
That's pretty cheap.
I'll take it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, if that's
what it is.
I'll take it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_31_0_4}Don't show stuff
that can't be sold!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How much is that
{29_0}?
{41_3_2}{2a_1_5}G for you.
{2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
That's enough buying
for today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm Doctor Hardy.
Please to make
your acquaintance...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not feeling so
well today...{NextPage_49}
A Doctor can't get
sick, though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_31_0_9}Sorry...
Will you leave me
alone today...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_31_0_4}What...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_31_0_4}...You need
something from me? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_31_0_4}If you're
smart you won't talk
to me today...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_31_0_4}I'm not feeling
too well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_151}Good morning. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_151}Oh, what's up? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_151}Good evening. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_151}What's going on
tonight? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah, you've got
something good there.{NextPage_49}
Will you give it
to me? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_31_0_3}Are you sure...?
Thank you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_31_0_4}Hmph, thanks for
nothing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like that...
How did you know what
I like?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like that kind of
stuff. Please keep
that in mind. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_31_0_4}...Yuck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
As a doctor, I
shouldn't say my
likes and dislikes,{NextPage_1}but hey, when you
don't like something,
you don't like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really hate that.
Please try and
remember that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not interested
in that at all. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_150}Ugh...
What do you want me
to do with it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't you have
something better
than that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_150}Hmmm...Hmm...
He's healthy.
Everything's good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your son has got
nerves of steel. {NextPage_49}
He doesn't even
cry when he looks
at my face. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Quite a wise looking
face...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a naughty
looking face. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Such a quiet looking
face. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When most dogs look
at me, they tend to
howl...{NextPage_49}
{34_1_150}But this little guy
is so relaxed. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good dog...
He's probably very
healthy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not a
veterinarian...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like cats because
they don't care about
me. {NextPage_49}
{34_1_150}Nice kitty...
Cute kitty...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cat...
Is probably very
healthy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You need to monitor
your own chickens'
health. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know how to
gauge the health of
little chicks. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_150}Well, at present
it seems to be
okay...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You need to monitor
your own ducks'
health. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't diagnose
something like
that...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is a crop that
you grew?
Good job indeed. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're giving me
a share of your
crops? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_31_0_3}I see...
Well, I'll gladly
receive it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_150}I see...
So you're that
kind of person...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that organic? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that milk taken
from your farm?
{34_1_150}Is it fresh...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk looks
rich... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that
cheese? {NextPage_49}
{34_1_150}It looks quite
delicious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Delicious cheese
goes well with any
cuisine. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cheese is good
for you, so eat
a lot of it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whether an egg is
good or not depends
on hens. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Try not to eat too
many eggs. {NextPage_49}
They're high in
cholesterol. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wild plants taken
from around here...{NextPage_49}
They're tasty if
you cook them. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The wild plants from
around here have an
unusual flavor. {NextPage_49}
One taste and you're
hooked...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you cook it?
It looks good...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks good, but
I like fish.
Remember that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of sickle
is that? It looks
pretty unwieldy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know where
you picked that up,
but it looks dull...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How do you like
that sickle?
{41_3_1}I like it.
Don't use it.
Give it back.
----------x----------
{50_31_0_3}Good. There's nothing
like a good sharp
blade.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_31_0_4}After all I did for
you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...
Well, if you don't
want it... {NextPage_49}
Maybe I can use it
next time I have
to operate...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't swing that
around so much.
You'll get hurt...{NextPage_49}
But if you get hurt,
I'll fix you up...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cut your grass with
it. That's why I gave
it to you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you going
to do with that
sickle? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't run with a
sickle in your hand.
You'll get hurt...{NextPage_49}
But if you get hurt,
I'll fix you up...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_150}That's a pump for
milking cows...{NextPage_49}
The human mothers use
something like that
too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_150}It's a fine
machine...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Clippers, huh...?
I have no need for
those. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Go some place where
there are a lot of
hair things if you {NextPage_49}
want to use those
clippers. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those clippers are
way too big to use
on my head. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you trying to
cut off my head? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_150}What's that...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Won't you show me
something a little
more interesting? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's quite an
unusual stone...{NextPage_49}
It'll fetch quite a
nice price if sold. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_150}That's a rare looking
stone. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wild plants around
here may be
medicinal...{NextPage_49}
I'll look into it
one of these days...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't eat all the
wild plants around
here, but it could{NextPage_1}be useful depending
on how you use it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a record.
It's not commonly
found around here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's not a
frisbee, okay?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_150}What's that?
It's got a really
strong odor to it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you use that when
you cook, the food
becomes too pungent.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}Hmmm???
{34_1_150}It makes a
nice sound...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}That's a really
good drum...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that Wally's
medal...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh well.
Guess it's yours
now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, it's a pendant.
Is it for me...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_31_0_3}Um, thanks really,
but I have to pass.{NextPage_49}
Go find someone
else to give it to. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_31_0_3}Hah hah hah...
I was kidding, really! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's such a pretty
necklace.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've been Romana's
family doctor for
quite some time,{NextPage_1}yet she's still
as stubborn as
ever when I tell {NextPage_1}her to take her
medicine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Still, it's better
than working for a
big hospital.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, do you know
the other Doctor?{NextPage_49}
He's a friend of
mine who lives in
Mineral Town...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what he's
doing now...
I heard he made a{NextPage_1}girlfriend in Mineral
Town... I wonder if
they are doing well{NextPage_1}together. He's a good
doctor but pretty
shy. I taught him{NextPage_1}everything I know
about medicine, but
I can't do anything{NextPage_1}about his shyness.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer
in Mineral Town is
obsessed with money.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farm
owner in Mineral
Town is quite {NextPage_1}popular among
the townspeople. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard {29_0}
"cleared" the field
work.{NextPage_49}
What the heck is
"clear" anyway? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farm
owner in Mineral
Town raises a lot {NextPage_1}of animals.
How about you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farm
owner in Mineral
Town mines a lot...{NextPage_49}
The ore seems to
have no end...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farm
owner in Mineral Town
is quite an amazing{NextPage_1}fisherman... I wonder
if he earned the
title...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's a story that
{29_0} of
Mineral Town walked{NextPage_1}1,000,000 steps.
So what...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} Farm in
Mineral Town is said
to have been around {NextPage_1}for over 50 years.
It's really lasted
the test of time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farm
owner in Mineral
Town ignores his {NextPage_1}farm and fishes
all day long. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is money that
important?{NextPage_49}
I'm talking about
{29_0} Farm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer
in Mineral Town owns
3 vacation homes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Seems there's a
blacksmith who can
make amazing tools.{NextPage_49}
I wonder if he'd
make me a scalpel? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_31_0_3}I loved the stuff
you gave me last
time...{NextPage_49}
I'd love to have
it again...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_31_0_9}The stuff you gave
me last time was
really disgusting.{NextPage_49}
Don't give me any
more ever, okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} I
had last time wasn't
half bad. {NextPage_49}
Still not better
than what Vesta
makes, though. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} I
had last time was
really delicious.{NextPage_1}Bring me some more
next time...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_31_0_3}The {29_0} I
had last time was
quite possibly the{NextPage_1}most delicious thing
I've EVER eaten.{NextPage_49}
Even better than
what Vesta makes.{NextPage_49}
But, keep that last
part a secret...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_31_0_3}I loved the taste
of the {29_0}
you gave me before.{NextPage_49}
That fresh, crisp
taste is my
favorite...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk you gave
me before was good.
It was very fresh.{NextPage_49}
It made my stomach
rumble a little
though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk I had
before was good,
but I imagine it {NextPage_1}would also make
a great cheese. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My goodness, the
milk I had last
time was delicious! {NextPage_1}You've got quite
a cow there...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk I had last
time was pretty good,
but kind of too rich.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk I had
last time was a
little smelly...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_31_0_3}That cheese last time
was great! Can you
give me some more?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The cheese I had
last time was a
little smelly. {NextPage_1}Yet, I could get
addicted to it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you
gave me was very
delicious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The stuff you cooked
last time was tasty. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The wild plant you
gave me had a very
unusual flavor. {NextPage_49}
I love that sort
of stuff...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The wild plant you
gave me was very
good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're looking good
nowadays. {NextPage_49}
You have the look
of a seasoned
farmer now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard you're
getting good at
farming. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got
a reputation for
being a good cook. {NextPage_49}
You might want to
become a chef
maybe? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've become quite
skilled you're really
working hard.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're working hard
in your fields. {NextPage_49}
I can tell just by
looking at your
hands. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your cooking skills
have gotten better,
don't you think?{NextPage_49}
You've got quite
a reputation now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So, how's farm life?
You seem to be
picking it up easy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How's the fields?
You seem to be doing
well...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So can you cook
now? You seem to
be getting better...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's wrong?
Are you feeling okay?
{41_3_1}I'm okay.
My stomach's Gruu...
I get dizzy easily.
----------x----------
Well, that's good
to hear. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't you have
any food? Go eat some
wild plants.{NextPage_49}
It's better than
nothing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're just tired.
Take a good rest.
Eat and sleep well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The human body is
an amazing thing. {NextPage_49}
It lets you know
when you need to
sleep, eat, or rest. {NextPage_49}
Heed your body's
signals, otherwise
you'll get sick. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you don't eat,
you're more open
to exhaustion. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're wondering
about my left eye...?{NextPage_49}
I'll tell you
about it sometime. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't this desk big?{NextPage_49}
Long ago, I used to
use it to operate
on my patients. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Even doctors get
to go to the Bar. {NextPage_49}
The drink here
gives you energy.
I assure you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you feel tired,
drink something here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My personal
recommendation is
the Stone Oil. {NextPage_49}
It's a good one,
but maybe it's
a little strong...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The most affordable
stuff is named
Moon Trip. {NextPage_49}
Even the name
sounds good...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you need
medicine, buy it
from Van. {NextPage_49}
I made them, so
you can count on
them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take care of your
body. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can take a look
at my bonsai if
you want to. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes I like to
come here to relax
and enjoy my {NextPage_1}favorite drink.
It really refreshes
my body. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What did you order?{NextPage_49}
My personal
recommendation is
the Stone Oil. {NextPage_49}
It's a good one,
but maybe it's
a little strong...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How are you feeling?
Don't push yourself
too hard...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_31_0_9}It's too bad I
wasn't able to
save Nina. {NextPage_49}
I want Galen to live
long for her... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How are you feeling?
I can give you some
advise on your health{NextPage_1}when you come to my
house. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I come here to check
up on Old Ms.
Romana.{NextPage_49}
It's pretty far, so
it tires me out...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's a lot of
unique people in
this town...{NextPage_49}
I don't stand out
so much, right...?
No...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...What are you
looking at?{NextPage_49}
Don't judge people
by appearances.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You need to really
be careful not to
get heat exhaustion{NextPage_1}during the really
hot seasons.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_31_0_9}{34_1_150}It's really hot... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How are you feeling
today? {NextPage_49}
Are you getting
enough rest...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The food during this
season is really
good. {NextPage_49}
You've got to be
careful not to
overeat. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be careful not to
catch a cold. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_31_0_9}{34_1_150}My legs are cold... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This garden is kept
very well. {NextPage_49}
Sebastian does such
a good job.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm concerned by
Galen's sudden
aging after {NextPage_1}Nina's death. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When this old man
speaks about bonsai,
he gets lively. {NextPage_49}
Sometimes he's
a little stubborn...
...Me too...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Visiting a graveyard
like this makes me
realize how very {NextPage_1}powerless we
doctors are in the
Grand Scheme. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Speaking of which, I
was walking around
here a few nights {NextPage_1}ago, and heard
a girl screaming...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you know Nina
well? She was such a
nice person...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure she'd
appreciate it if
you were to clean {NextPage_1}her gravesite
now and again. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm worried about
Van. He only eats
very high-calorie {NextPage_1}foods. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He tries to diet, but
usually he tends
to overeat... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, okay...{NextPage_1}...Nah, maybe later.{NextPage_0}
