\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136I must say, we are getting\u2328on a bit in years...\u232bSeeing all those young folks\u2328makes me nostalgic for my\u2328own youth.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb1\u1f49\u2135Oh my, what's all this?\u2328You don't usually talk\u2328about the "good old days."\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136Well, for some reason, I\u2328feel like talking about\u2328them tonight, Rose...\u232bYou were the belle of the\u2328ball back then, and I was\u2328head over heels for you...\u232bI gave you flowers, love\u2328letters... Anything to win\u2328your hand. And I did!
\u1f40\u1fb1\u1f49\u2135Flattery will get you\u2328everywhere, my dear.
\u1f40\u1fb1\u1f48\u2135That's enough for tonight.\u2328We should head to bed.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136I didn't realize it was\u2328so late.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136Here's to many more years\u2328to reminisce over together.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb1\u1f49\u2135Yes, darling.
