Have you seen {CharName_4} today?
{41_2_0}I saw her.
I haven't seen her.
----------x----------
W-w-w-where did you see her?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We wanted her to stay a lot longer, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We thought for sure {CharName_4} had left
{Location_43_30_23} for good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh dear, that's right.
I can't just stand around like this!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's to be lonely about? It's actually{NextPage_1}a relief. If you are going to lead this
family you have to be strong!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take good care of {CharName_26} for us.
He's too old to just be
partying every day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you seen {CharName_4} today?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}...
Please do.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_0},
How've you been, dear?{32_1_244}
Are you hungry?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
By the way, I heard that you've
been cooking at home. Is that right?
{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_1}Well then, I've got something
for you. Just a minute.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_7}Oh, I see.{32_3_232}
{50_25_0_1}Well, why don't you give this
to your spouse? Just a minute.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_1}This is a very rare spice that
I got when my husband and I were
traveling in the south seas.{NextPage_49}
It's a little strong, but with it you can
make some great dishes.{32_1_244}
Why don't you try using it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}Oh, {CharName_0}.
You were hungry, weren't you?
Well,{32_1_244} why don't you go home and eat. {32_1_244}OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_35}You were in too much of a hurry, {CharName_0}...
Couldn't you have stayed a bit longer?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, could you
sing a little something for our friend
{CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Excuse me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't you have anything to
sell today?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, if you don't have anything
to sell, I guess I'd better go.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm just looking...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_35}Not much here that I'm interested in.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No, I'm just window shopping...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like the {29_0},
but how much is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
{50_25_0_10}Really?
That's a steal! Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll take it.
Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a little expensive.
But I guess I'll take it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well then, never mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wouldn't mind that {29_0}...
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
I guess I'll pass today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you working hard?
Or hardly working? Haha.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_2}I'm not feeling so well today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_2}I'm sorry. Could you leave me alone?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_4}I'm in a bad mood today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_120}Morning.
How are you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_120}Hello.
I hope you're well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_120}What are you doing out at this hour?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_120}What are you doing out at this hour?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_120}Well, make yourself at home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello there.
How are things?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I love that kind of thing.
Could I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_120}Are you sure it's OK?
{50_25_0_10}Well, thank you very much!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry.
{50_25_0_26}I guess I was a little too pushy there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Could I have that?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_120}It looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Say, you've got something nice there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's one of my favorites.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_9}No, I'm afraid I don't like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_9}I love cooking, but to be honest,
I can't stand that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_9}I'm sorry, I'll have to pass on that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that you have there?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_2}I certainly don't want it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_10}What a cute child.
He looks a lot like Marlin.
His mouth in particular...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_10}{CharName_1}, how old are you?
{50_25_0_10}{32_5_220}How old are you?
{32_5_220}{50_25_0_35}...........Not much of a talker.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_10}What a cute kid.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going to take over the farm
when you grow up?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_10}Hello, cutie pie.
You look a lot like your Daddy.{NextPage_1}Your eyes are practically identical.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_10}What a cute child.
Looks a lot like you.{NextPage_1}His mouth looks a bit like Gustafa's.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute little doggie.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_35}Shake!{32_5_220}Come on, shake!
{32_5_220}{50_25_0_9}Maybe he doesn't like me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute doggie.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, a kitty cat.
How cute...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks like a fine chicken.
I bet it lays good eggs.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How cute.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They say that if you take care of
your chickens, they'll lay golden eggs.
You believe that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you know that ducks can't
keep their own eggs warm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cute duck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you get a good look at them,
ducks can be pretty cute, you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of seed is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you need seeds, you can buy them
over at Vesta's farm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet that would sprout if you'd
just plant it somewhere.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you grow that on your farm?
How about giving us some once in a while?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess there are lots of kinds of crops.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that cheese on your farm?
I bet it'd be good in cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The taste of cheese changes depending on
the milk you use. Did you know that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The quality of an egg depends on how
the chicken is treated.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Eggs can be used in all kinds of dishes.
They're very useful.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess you can't really tell a duck
egg from a chicken egg, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you catch that fish?
You must be a good fisherman.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are lots of kinds of fish dishes,
but I think a nice fish stew is the
best.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That fish looks pretty fresh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you find that around here?
Those are pretty good in cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's see... I bet that kind of thing
would be good in tempura.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are lots of unusual plants in
Forget-Me-Not Valley. That's one of them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you cook that?
It looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That dish looks tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that the hoe my husband used to
have? We were keeping it because it's so
unusual, but we never used it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure that hoe is happy to be
used by you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty strange hoe, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Didn't I see that hoe at Vesta's farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe looks well broken in and
easy to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a fine hoe you've got there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you've got a new tool, you've
got to break it in.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got to use that more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that your hoe?
You've been using it a lot, I see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks very easy to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now that's an unusual sickle.
It looks kind of hard to use, though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a strange sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That sure looks sharp.
Don't go waving it around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_35}You could hurt somebody
with one of those things.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that your sickle?
You've been using it a lot, I see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a watering can?
What an unusual shape.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an odd-looking watering can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a strange contraption.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what it's for?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, clippers.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe you can give my husband a trim?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_35}I don't need a haircut myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those look like they would hurt
if you used them to cut somebody's hair.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_35}I don't think those would work
very well for cutting your kid's hair.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now that's a handsome tool.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an unusual stone.
It might be worth something.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that thing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's pretty weird looking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, a record.
You don't see many of those anymore.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You shouldn't throw those, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So?
How do you like that?
{41_3_1}It's delicious.
It's not great.
How do you use it?
----------x----------
{50_25_0_10}That's good.
You must like spicy foods,
huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_9}Oh, I see...
You don't like it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you boil some vegetables with that
spice you can make some delicious
curry. Can't make curry without it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty rare spice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}We've got a lot of unusual things,
but I've never seen anything like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that the medal that Wally
used to have?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder why Wally decided
to get rid of that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an unusual necklace.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Not my taste, though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that anyway?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why are you showing me that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now that's quite a firecracker.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going to set it off?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a present for someone?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_35}I don't need it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've been thinking about going to
Mineral Town.
Maybe I'll find some new recipes...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you been cooking recently?
Let me tell you something interesting.

----------x----------
Before we came here, my husband and
I traveled around the world.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love cooking, so we went all over
trying out all kinds of different
foods.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My husband and I met while we were
traveling, but we never
had a proper wedding.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer from Mineral Town is
crazy with greed.
Don't spread that around, though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer from Mineral Town is
very popular in town, I hear.
You think that's true?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
To grow every crop there is... Wow!
Oh, I was just talking about Mineral Town.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer from Mineral Town is
very kind to her animals, or so
I've heard.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer from Mineral Town apparently
spends all day digging the mountains.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer from Mineral Town is
quite an angler, I hear.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer from Mineral Town walks
a lot from what I hear.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} Farm in Mineral Town has
been operating for 50 years.
Can you last that long?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer from Mineral Town is
ignoring his farm and spends all
day fishing. At least that's the rumor.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer from Mineral Town has
really bad taste from what I hear.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer from Mineral Town has
three cottages.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} Farm in Mineral Town has
some amazing tools, I hear.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_10}That thing you gave me was
just fantastic.
Did you know it was one of my favorites?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_9}That thing you gave me
wasn't the best.
Could you give me a better one next time?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave me was rich
and very delicious.
{50_25_0_10}I'd love some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese was kind of smelly.
But it was nice and rich.
I could get to like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave me is
hard to come by, isn't it?
It's quite exceptional.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that cheese you gave
me, didn't you?
It was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me
tasted just fantastic.
You made that yourself?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That dish you gave me wasn't bad.
Maybe it's just not my taste.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The fish you caught for me was just great
as part of a Meuniere Set.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That fish you gave me was pretty
tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That wild plant you gave me was
very tasty.
I made it into some Tempura.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That wild plant you gave me was
pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That thing you gave me tasted...
well, it was OK, I guess.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It seems like you're better
at your work recently.
{50_25_0_10}You've become quite a farmer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're quite good at growing
things, aren't you?
I think you have talent.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're quite good at cooking, aren't you?
I think you have talent.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're working hard on your farm.
I can tell by the way you look.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Growing crops is hard, isn't it?
But you're working hard.
One look at your hands tells me that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you cook a lot at home?
I've heard you're pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks like you're used
to working on the farm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks like you're used
to working in the fields.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks like you're used
to cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love cooking, so my hobby is to
go to lots of different places collecting
recipes.{NextPage_49}
So if I feel like it, I might tell you
some interesting recipes sometime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My husband and I have traveled all over,
so I've had all kinds of delicious foods.{NextPage_49}
I think that's what made me want to
cook for myself. No, really.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you make any tasty dishes,
bring them here for me to see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, make yourself at home.
Sorry I can't get you anything
to eat or drink.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take it easy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're here too?
Be sure and stop by our
inn sometime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't waste too much time here.
I've got to get home and start supper...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
In most places, spring would be the time
when the inns and hotels get a lot of
business, but things never change here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, let's just take it easy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's so darn hot.
I always feel hot anyway, so I
can't stand this time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's so hot...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a bit cooler now, isn't it?
There are so many good foods in the fall.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wild plants and mushrooms are good now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's so darn cold.
I always feel chilled anyway, so I
can't stand this time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_35}Brrrrr.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was just saying how Vesta's
vegetables are all so
tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Vesta and I have been talking
about making a diet menu using
her vegetables.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What should I cook today?
I know so many recipes that it's
hard to choose.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe you've noticed, Van comes here
sometimes.{NextPage_49}
Every time he comes in this
house it feels like it's going to
collapse.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_35}All of the decorations in our inn
are very rare and valuable, so be careful
not to break them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you.
But I'll have to pass for now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't stand this kind of weather.
I hope it stops raining soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going somewhere?
----------x----------
I heard that {29_0} from Mineral
Town has a dog that's really good
at catching dog disks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that {29_0} from Mineral
Town has won the horse race
10 times.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is a chicken festival, anyway?
Oh, I just heard that the farmer from
Mineral Town won it 10 times.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that {29_0} from Mineral
Town has won the cow festival
10 times.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is a sheep festival, anyway?
Oh, I just heard that {29_0} from
Mineral Town won it 10 times.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to be going to bed soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's my bedtime.
Could you be moving along?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I need to be going out soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to leave now, so
if you don't mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See you later!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_9}Now now, {CharName_29}.
Don't get so upset.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_7}Oh, I see...{32_3_232}
{50_25_0_1}Well, maybe you can save it for
your future spouse. Just a minute.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_1}Welcome.
Make yourself at home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_9}Um... There's something I want
to talk to you about.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_9}Is that all right?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}What is it?
I'm a little busy right now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_9}You're getting along well with Rock.{NextPage_1}I was just wondering what it
was that you liked about
him.{NextPage_1}You see, most people don't seem to like to
spend time with him...with the way he
is, so I wondered what kind of a weird...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Err. What kind of an understanding
person you must be...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_9}I suppose you don't know what I'm talking
about, coming to you like this.{NextPage_1}But if you like him even a little
bit, I was wondering if you would
like to be with him.{NextPage_1}I'm afraid we may never find another
person who can put up with him.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_9}Of course, I won't force you.
I just thought there might be some hope.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_9}We don't have to talk about it.
Just please stay with him.{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Well, um, OK then...
I'll pass.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_7}Oh, I see.
I guess I must have been mistaken. I
thought that you and Rock were...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_7}I see.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have brought it up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_7}I see.
Never mind then.
I'm sorry for bothering you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_1}What is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_1}What are you saying?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_1}Tim...{NextPage_1}I don't regret it one bit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_10}I love it here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_1}You feel the same way, right?{NextPage_1}So there's no problem.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_9}Are you sure you're satisfied with me?{NextPage_1}I'm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_25_0_10}Well, I guess I'd better get
dinner ready for Nami...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You planned all of this,
Nami?{NextPage_1}Thank you very much!{NextPage_0}
