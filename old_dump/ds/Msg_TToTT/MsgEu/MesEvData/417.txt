\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f48\u2135Not at all. What is it?\u232b\u1f41\u1fb5\u1f48\u2136It's about my daughter.\u2328She won't talk to me about\u2328her personal life anymore.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f48\u2135Oh is that all?\u2328That's not unusual\u2328for girls her age.\u232bI know that you're worried,\u2328but you mustn't push it.\u232bShe'll come around in her\u2328own time, Howard.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fb5\u1f48\u2136I know, but still...
\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f49\u2135I'll have an order of\u2328\u1000.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136It's tough when you realize\u2328your children don't need\u2328you as much anymore.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f48\u2135Yes. It's hard to let go.
\u1f41\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136Of course. But you have to\u2328start treating them as\u2328adults sometime.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb6\u1f49\u2136Laney needs to see if she\u2328can make it without her\u2328father's advice.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f49\u2135Yes. It's all part of\u2328growing up.
\u1f41\u1fb5\u1f48\u2136Sorry to keep you waiting,\u2328Mr. Rutger.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f48\u2135No problem.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f49\u2135You've got to trust that\u2328your daughter will come to\u2328you if she really needs you.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f48\u2135Well then, I'll be going.
\u1f41\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136I'm sure Laney will talk to\u2328you if you give her time.\u232bJust wait and see.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb5\u1f48\u2135You're right. I'll do that.
\u1f41\u1fb6\u1f49\u2136See you later.
