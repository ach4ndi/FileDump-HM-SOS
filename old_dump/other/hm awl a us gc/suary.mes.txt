Oh, it's you.{32_3_232}
You came just at the right time.{NextPage_49}
Would you like to have these
clippers?{NextPage_49}
{CharName_13} is more conscious of his
appearance and won't let me use them.{NextPage_49}
But I thought they might come in
handy on your farm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Use them well.
Bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm. Not a bad time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're certainly fast. It's important
to keep your knees up, though.{NextPage_49}
Pretty soon {CharName_13} will
have himself quite a competitor.
Keep practicing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The three of us were just talking about
having a race.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We'd like you to be the starter.{32_7_208}
OK, we really
appreciate your help.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, Hugh... pant pant...{32_3_232}
trains... every day... pant pant...{32_3_232}
But to be able...to keep up with {CharName_13}...{32_3_232}{NextPage_1}You must be quite a runner too...
Whew....{32_3_232} Pretty impressive... Pant pant...{32_3_232}
I'm getting too old for this...Pant...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No... pant pant.... Seriously...{32_3_232}
I'd be happy to be your coach... pant....
Do you think you would{32_3_232}{NextPage_1}want to play... pant... sports with {CharName_13}?
There are so many new sports around...{32_3_232}
I bet you'd have a chance... at a medal.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like the {29_0}, but
how much is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
{50_11_0_10}Really?!
{50_11_0_0}That's pretty good...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK, I guess I'll take it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a little expensive.
Well, OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...
OK then...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll take the {29_0}.
How much is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
{34_1_67}Hi, how're you doing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_67}Hey there! Good morning!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_67}Hello.
How are you feeling today?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're out late.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_67}Welcome.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's one of my favorites.
Is it for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_11_0_10}Well, thanks very much.{50_11_0_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_11_0_4}Then don't show it to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ooh! That looks good!
Could I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
That looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's something nice there.
Are you giving it to me?
{41_2_1}Give it to him.
Don't give it to him.
----------x----------
{50_11_0_10}All right! Thanks a lot.
{50_11_0_0}I'll treasure it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_11_0_2}Why you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's very nice.
You not going to give it to me, are you?
{41_2_1}It's yours.
Of course not.
----------x----------
{50_11_0_9}Eww. Get that away from me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute child.
The spitting image of {CharName_0}. I'd be glad
to train him when he's older.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come and run with me!
Maybe it's a little too early, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My son Hugh would be glad to
race your child in a few years.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute dog.
Want to race, doggie?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a cute dog, all right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not very fond of cats.
I wonder if he could run faster than me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cute chick.
Want to race? What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cute chick.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Forget about the chicken,
bring me the eggs.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ducks are slow runners, so I don't
think it would be much of a contest.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know much about plants, but
that's some kind of seed, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a crop from your farm?
If it's fresh, I'd be glad to take it.
If it's OK with you, that is.{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Could I have that?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Fresh vegetables are good for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wild plants are good for you. Good fiber.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's one of those wild plants.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make this yourself?
It looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you cook, too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks very good, but I wonder how many
calories it has?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know much about farming, but I
think that's a hoe, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing with that hoe?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know much about farming, but I
think that's a sickle, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing with that sickle?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We don't have a garden at my house
so we don't need those.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are the clippers I gave you.
Do you like them?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_11_0_10}That's good.{50_11_0_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_11_0_9}Oh, I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A lot of memories in those clippers...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't train with something like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know much about tools
like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those grow all along my
jogging course...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh!
Are you going to be participating in
the discus throw?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That seems a little light
for throwing, though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that some kind of seasoning?
I wonder if it's good for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's the medal I used to
have.
Take good care of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That medal is the result of my sweat and
tears. Don't sell it or anything.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I look at that I remember the past.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that anyway?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Forget-Me-Not Valley is nice and
big. Perfect for running. You don't have
to worry about bumping into people.{NextPage_49}
I'm a marathon coach for a company in the
city, so it would really be more
convenient for us to live there.{NextPage_49}
But I wanted to be able to run somewhere
like this, so we moved here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know, I used to be kind
of famous a long time ago.
As a pro athlete, of course...{NextPage_49}
But I injured my leg during
a race and...
So now I'm a coach, you see?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you think about Hugh?
He's a pretty fast runner, don't you
think? I know he's got talent.{NextPage_49}
I'll make him into a top-class athlete
if it kills me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
・・・・・{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard {29_0} from Mineral Town
has walked one million paces, but I've
run at least that much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That thing you gave me was
really delicious.
I'd love some more sometime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me was
good. I'm sure it's good for you, too.
No, really.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me seemed like
it was really nutritious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That fish you caught was
fair.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That wild plant you gave me tasted
all right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That food you gave me was...
Well, I don't know how to describe it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You look different somehow...
Like a real farmer...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Raising crops is difficult, but you're
doing well.
And you look quite fit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you like running?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
I thought so...
You look pretty fast.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's can't be true, can it?
I've seen you run around this
area many times.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you get tired from running,
you have to take little breaks.
And don't forget to eat right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I jog with my son every day,
so if you like you can join us.
It feels good, you know!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Running is good for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got to sweat to be a real athlete.
{50_11_0_10}{34_1_66}Ha ha ha...{50_11_0_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Recently my running pace has
gotten slower.
Maybe it's my age...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's strange... Recently I feel like
the weights on my training machines and
dumbbells are disappearing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nobody would want to steal a
dumbbell weight, would they?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you don't have weights on your
barbells, there's no point in training.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like to come here sometimes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe it's not so good for you though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't touch the machines or devices
around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_11_0_10}Are you sweating, my friend?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's important keep up your
training every day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This time of year is perfect for running.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sweating while you exercise is
good for you.
And it feels good, too!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This time of year is a little hot
for running.{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
I love running at this time of year,
with the autumn leaves, and all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When it's this cold, you've got to
go running to warm yourself up.{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
The snow doesn't accumulate
around here, so it's great
for running.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm training at the moment.
Pant, pant... Could you talk to me later?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If I talk while I'm running, pant...
I'll mess up my breathing rhythm, pant...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_11_0_4}I'm training at the moment... pant...
Could you...pant... talk to me later?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The old man who lives here may be
stubborn, but he's a good husband.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't you think that this room
makes you relaxed? It's like... I don't
know, it calms me down somehow.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Stopping by places like this to
relax is an important part of
any training regime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
To a top athlete, maintaining your
health is almost as important as training.
So I sometimes get a checkup like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
For an athlete, having a doctor
so close by is really very
convenient.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Shouldn't you get an examination
yourself?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, how are you?
{50_11_0_9}My Hugh doesn't seem to want to
listen to me these days...{NextPage_49}
I guess he's in a rebellious stage.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hugh always used to be so good about
doing what I told him, but recently he's
been skipping his training.{NextPage_49}
{50_11_0_9}I wonder why...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Children can be difficult, can't they?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, I've got something
for you. I got this medal
when I won a race long ago.{NextPage_49}
You may think its strange, but please
take it. I'd like to forget
my past. Please...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you.
But I'll have to pass right now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't skip your training just because
of the rain.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
On days like this I miss asphalt
roads.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0},
you've gone to your eternal rest.{NextPage_49}
Leave {CharName_1} to me.
I may not be able to replace you, but
I'll do my best to be a good role model.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27},
how about a song?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm getting kind of sleepy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time for me to go to bed.
Could you be going home now?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to be leaving soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to go out now,
so I'll see you later.
----------x----------
Well, goodbye.{NextPage_0}
