Oh, listen to me for
second.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Something great happened today!
My boss called me into his office.{NextPage_49}
He said, “You always work so hard,
Grant. I've got some good news for you.{NextPage_49}
You've been chosen to be the
head of our new branch office.
Congratulations.”{NextPage_49}
Heh heh heh.{NextPage_49}
Finally. Finally!
My time has come.{NextPage_49}
It was a long time coming, too.
A very long time.{NextPage_49}
At last, I am one of the
elite of the business world!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ha ha, ha!{32_1_144}
I'm going to go out drinking tonight!{32_3_232}
----------x----------
Hello there.
Make yourself at home...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_3}Oh, that's right!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}I've got a little present
for you.
Well, it used to be mine, but...{NextPage_49}
I've been a businessman for many years.
I have to get up early, so I've always
slept with an alarm clock set.{NextPage_49}
But recently I find that I wake up before
the alarm rings.
I guess it's become a habit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Anyway, I don't need this alarm clock
anymore, so I thought I would
give it to you...{NextPage_49}
I thought I might bring it over now,
if it's no trouble.
{41_2_0}Sure.
No.
----------x----------
{50_14_0_3}That's good.
Well, let's go.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_9}............................{NextPage_49}
I see...
Well, I'll leave right after I drop it
off, so let's go anyway.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll just leave it here.
It's very easy to use... I'm sure you
farmers need to get up early.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well then, I'll see you later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This clock keeps very good time,
so take care of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Excuse me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All sold out today...?
Oh well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't seem to have anything,
so I guess I'll come back some other day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_0}.
How's the farm going?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}Oh! That's one of my favorites.
Could I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_3}Well, thank you
very much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_9}{34_1_81}Ah.
I should have known...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}Ooh, you've got something nice there.
I love that kind of thing.
I couldn't have that, could I?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_3}Really?!
Thank you very much!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_9}{34_1_81}I'm not very fond of that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_9}I'll pass.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not interested in that
kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute child.
Would make a nice friend for my Kate.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute child.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Does that dog do something?
You know, talk, sing, do your taxes...{NextPage_49}
Just kidding.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cats live their own lives, don't they?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, is it that chicken that
cries out every morning...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you have geese at your farm too?
Making foie gras or something...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that milk on your farm?
I don't suppose I could have it...?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
That milk must be tastier than
the kind you get in the city.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that cheese on your farm?
I don't suppose I could have it...?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
That cheese looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that butter on your farm?
I don't suppose I could have it...?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
That butter looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}Could I have that?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Eggs change in flavor depending on how
the chicken was raised, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I used to go fishing all the time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see those around here quite often.
I guess they're edible...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But you probably can't eat them raw.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a new hoe, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Something about that hoe...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a normal hoe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a new sickle, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Something about that sickle..?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a normal sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You shouldn't walk around with a sickle...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've used that sickle quite a bit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not sure what kind of reaction you're
expecting by showing me that...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Something about that watering can...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you cut your hair with those?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are some big clippers.{NextPage_1}If you used that on somebody's head
I bet they'd bleed all over the place...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are some big clippers.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are those clippers?
{50_14_0_9}Actually, I already have a
barber who I go to...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a pretty flower.
Going to decorate your room or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a pretty flower.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}That's a strange drum.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}..........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Does that medal have a special meaning?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a souvenir or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sheet music, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_9}Ah!! A bomb!?{32_1_244}
{50_14_0_0}Oh, fireworks...
You scared me there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a big firecracker.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I work as an accountant in the
city, but I wanted to live somewhere
quiet, so I came here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I'm tired from work I
always want to have a drink, so I
stop by the {Location_43_33_23} across the way.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm feeling tired
recently.
Tired of everything...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Back when I used to fish, I
once met someone who was called a
fishing master.{NextPage_49}
He had apparently caught all of the
fish in the world.
I think his name was...Greg.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear that the farmer in Mineral Town
is a very good person.
I bet she'll be the next mayor.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} Farm's animals
must be very happy.
After all, they're well taken care of.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear that the farmer in Mineral Town
is a master angler.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer in Mineral Town has certainly
lived a long life.
Why, she's been farming for 50 years.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear that the farmer in Mineral Town
ignores her farm and goes fishing all
day. Sounds pretty good, actually.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear that the farmer in Mineral Town
has three cottages.
I wish I had three cottages. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}That thing you gave me a bit ago
was incredibly delicious.
I'd love some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_9}That thing you gave me
was really... um...
bad. (Sorry!){NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That {29_0} you gave me
was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}The {29_0} you gave me
was pretty good.
I'd love some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}The {29_0} you gave me
was the best!
It was really good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me
was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me
was incredibly good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese was a little smelly,
but I could get to like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave me
was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}That {29_0} you gave me
was seasoned just perfectly.
You made it, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}That dish you gave me
was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}My wife cooked that fish you
caught.
It was delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}My wife cooked those
wild plants you gave me.
They were delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That thing you gave me
was good. Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear that you're quite a
good cook.
I bet you have talent.{NextPage_49}
I'm jealous.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Working in the fields must be tough.
But you're doing well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You seem to have gotten used to farm work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My wife Samantha decorated this room.
Not bad, is it?
I like it too. Yes...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A wooden house just feels good.
So warm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm glad we came here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I enjoy listening to music.
I used to have a good stereo, but my wife
said it was too noisy and got rid of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You have a stereo, right?
I often hear music playing at your farm.
That's nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be sure to show me if you
get any good records.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Kate's getting to that age...
I suppose she'll want
to find a boyfriend soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Samantha doesn't seem to be very
worried about Kate, but
fathers worry about their daughters...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be sure and tell me if Kate
gets a boyfriend.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_7}...I'm not afraid of that
boss of mine!
----------x----------
{50_14_0_7}{34_1_81}...I'm sorry...
I shink I'm a lil' drink...
I'm jush fine... Not drunk at all...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_7}{34_1_81}Hic!
.........Whew.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_7}My daughter seems to be
avoiding me recently...
{34_1_82}It's so lonely...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_7}Samantha and Kate
don't like me very much.
Don't you think so?
{41_3_1}That's not true!
That's right.
I wouldn't know.
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}Really? Thanks.
You're the only one who cares enough
to say things like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_7}{34_1_82}You think so too?
It doesn't matter...
I'm just... Sigh...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_7}{34_1_82}Of course not.
Nobody understands me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_82}{50_14_0_9}You know, sometimes I think...
Maybe there should be more to life...
You know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I sometimes like to stop by
places like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't mind me.
Go about your business...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hate going to the office
in weather like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We have air conditioning there, but
it's so strong that it's freezing.
It can't be good for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I see scenery like this,
I think that I really made the right
choice coming here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't stand the cold, so I don't
like going outside very much nowadays...
But I don't have any choice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The snow doesn't accumulate around here
so it's easy to walk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_82}Another hard day...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I get a chance to reflect like this,
I start thinking about my life... Is there
something more I could make of it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I must be happy.
After all, I'm living here with Samantha
and Kate...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_81}Could you leave me
alone for a while...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_2}{34_1_81}Ugh... I don't feel so well.
Jus a lil' too much to drink...
So.... Ugh....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_2}{34_1_81}Ugh.......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_2}{34_1_81}I'll be... fine...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_5}You think I drink 'cause I'm afraid
of my wife! I'm the boss in the family!{NextPage_49}
{50_14_0_7}{34_1_81}Ugh... Sorry...
Please Don't tell her I said that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_5}I'm not afraid of Samantha...
Not at all...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_7}{34_1_82}I'm sorry.
I'm a little drunk...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_14_0_10}I feel great today.
Would you like to play a little game?
It's a milk drinking contest. Heh heh.{NextPage_49}
So...do you want to try it?
{41_2_1}Sure.
No thanks.
----------x----------
Well, let's do it in the kitchen.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...
Well, maybe next time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I may not look it, but I'm quite a fast
milk drinker.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Want to try the milk drinking contest?
{41_2_1}Sure.
No thanks.
----------x----------
Thanks...
But I think I'll pass for today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd rather stay at home listening
to music on a day like this...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're working hard...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0} was such a good
friend...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, would you mind singing
a song for {CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to go to bed soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to bed now.
Would you mind leaving?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to be leaving soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to leave now...
See you later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See you later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Darn, I lose.{32_2_188}
But you won't beat me so easily next time.
Whew....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ha, ha! Even I can win at something!{32_2_188}
I'll try hard next time, too.{NextPage_0}
