Looks delicious...{NextPage_0}

That's nice. Is
that for me?{40_0_0}

I'm so happy now.{NextPage_0}

You want me to eat

Is it your chicken?{NextPage_0}

How cute.{NextPage_0}

A chicken well taken
care of has a Golden
Egg, I heard.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ducks don't
incubate their eggs.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute duck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ducks are pretty
cute actually.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what kind
of plant that is...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a seed?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that form your
farm? Looks pretty
good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You grow all kinds of
crops, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that from your
farm? Must be fresh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Milk tastes different
depending on cows and
their health.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that from your
farm? ...{24_1}Farm Original Cheese.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cheese tastes
different depending
on milk you use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that from your
farm? ...{24_1}Farm Original Butter.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Butter tastes
different depending
on the milk you use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Eggs taste different
depending on how
chickens are doing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hard to tell if it's
a chicken egg or
duck egg.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You caught that fish?
...Good job.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a pretty fish.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you get that
around here? You can
cook something good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are unique wild
plants in the valley.
That's one of them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that?
Looks pretty good...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, you can cook?
----------x----------
Looks delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a unique one.
Looks very heavy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That must be pretty
rare.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looks pretty old.
Can you still use it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looks dirty...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is it new? You have
to break it in...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It hasn't been used
much, has it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You have to break
it in more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where are you going
with that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that yours?
Looks like it fits
right in your hands.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It seems to be easy
to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a unique
sickle... Is it hard
to use...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an interesting
sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's so sharp.
You can't swing it
around here, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a strange
sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is it your sickle?
You have to break it
in more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's pretty new,
isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You have to break it
in to make it fit in
your hands.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't walk around
the town with a
sickle in your hands.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that your sickle?
...That's cool.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It must work very
well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a...
watering can?
Looks kind of funny.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a strange
watering can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You haven't used it
much, have you? Do
you water everyday?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That must be new.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can break in your
watering can to fit
right for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you watering?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It must be old, but
seems like it's very
easy to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That seems to be a
useful watering can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...What is it?
Milker...? Really.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that your new
milker?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can milk your
cows everyday, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where are you going
with that thing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looks dirty, but the
cows might like what
they are used to.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Seems like it's
very easy to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Clippers? I used to
have one of those.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's not electric.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are those new wool
clippers? Your sheep
must be very happy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You haven't used it
much, have you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They seem to work
quite well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you gonna shave
my hair with them?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They must be old, but
seems to work pretty
well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They look old.
----------x----------
It takes a while to
get used to a new
tool.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's exiting to
get a new too,
isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You waste a good
tool by laying it
around.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good tools save a
lot of time and
energy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can tell if you are
a good worker just by
looking at it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Seems to be a very
interesting tool...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an interesting
stone. You must be
able to sell it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's pretty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that...?
Where did you find
it...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks weird.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Some wild plants
around here are
medicinal.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you find it
around here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a record.
It's pretty rare in
this town.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's not a frisbee,
did you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Some kind of
seasoning? It must be
from {CharName_25}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can cook a
delicious meal with
it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}...
Sounds interesting...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}
What an interesting
looking drum.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that...
Wally's medal?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty
medal.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an interesting
pendant... Is it
something special?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's pretty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Uh...
Is that a music
sheet?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you want me
to do with it...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Fireworks...?
Oh, Kassey made it.
Or Patrick's?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are some large
fireworks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A gift for someone?
...I wonder if that's
a good idea...{NextPage_0}

What do you want me

----------x----------
That milk was so-so,
but it might be good
for something...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me
the other day was
pretty good, but{NextPage_1}it might be better if
you use it to make
cheese...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk was the
best! Why don't you

Takakura left a memo.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Mmm....mmmm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
TeeVee... Zoo TV...
Moo moo and baby
sheep... TeeVee...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your grandson got
big.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, and... {52_0_0_0}
{39_1}{CharName_0}
remodeled his house.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...He's helping his
mother too... Well,
sometimes...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It'll be interesting
to see him and the
farm from now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}He's so energetic
and cheerful just
like you were... {32_39_16}
----------x----------
He's mimicking
everything
{CharName_0} does.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He's gentle and
obedient, just like
his mother...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...But he's mimics
everything
{CharName_0} does.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You'd do anything for
your precious kids...
He worked hard to{NextPage_1}make a kid's room.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He'll now work even
harder on the farm...
I'd better, too...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farm is fine, and
he just made a kid's
room.{NextPage_49}
Kids need a good room
as they grow up...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your son has become a
good father.{NextPage_49}
...No wonder I'm
getting old...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...See? He's growing
up. He looks like you
now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't control
your kid's life
forever...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Well, isn't he
pretty tough now...?
He's healthy. {32_11_184}
----------x----------
What? Who is he? {32_3_232}
It's the little one.{32_3_232}
He's {CharName_1}.
{CharName_0}'s son.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's the rebellious
stage... You remember
that, don't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What? Who is he? {32_3_232}
It's the little one.{32_3_232}
He's {CharName_1}.
{CharName_0}'s son.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's the rebellious
stage... You remember
that, don't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Look carefully... {52_0_0_0}
{39_1}Your son's house
got bigger, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now that their son is
older, they had time
to make a bedroom.{NextPage_49}
The neighbors helped
{CharName_0} to
build it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He'll now work even
harder on the farm...
I'd better, too...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0} is
such a hard worker. {32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
He built a great
master bedroom.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your son is now a
proud farm owner.
Am I retiring soon?{NextPage_49}
Not quite. I'm gonna
keep working for a
while.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}He's grown up, eh? {32_39_16}
----------x----------
{35_2}How does it feel to
see your grandson all
grown up...? {32_39_16}{NextPage_49}
Look at him. He's
just like {CharName_0}.{32_39_16}{NextPage_49}
That means he's just
like you too. {32_39_16}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}'s an
adult now. He's
enjoying his life...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They must be happy to
see their son grown
up, but it must be{NextPage_1}hard to let him go...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
By the way, the
farm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your son is really a
hard worker. {32_7_208}{NextPage_49}
I was worried in the
beginning, but...
He's done so well.{NextPage_49}
He makes me busy too,
but I'll keep working
as long as I can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your son is working
hard and doing well
on the farm.{NextPage_49}
His family is happy,
so there's nothing to
worry about.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
His work is not going
too well, but... {32_7_208}{NextPage_49}
Your son is enjoying
his life.{NextPage_49}
It's okay...
Don't you think?
Enjoy your life...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your son got old...{32_7_208}
...So am I...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_73} still looks
young even though her
son has grown up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} has become
a good young man.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} is
tougher than his
father now...{NextPage_49}
...It might be time
for me to retire...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{41_2_0}Go after.
Forget it.
----------x----------
...Your son was not
meant to work on the
farm.{NextPage_49}
It's alright...
He needs to live in
his own way...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello? {32_2_188}
----------x----------
This way! {32_2_188}
----------x----------
Crops can't grow near
fruit trees!{NextPage_49}
Trees are stronger, so
they take all the
nutrients!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Takakura left a note.{NextPage_49}
"Someone wants to buy
that strange crop.{NextPage_49}
Seeds, too. Put those
crops in this box.
I'll go sell them."{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isolate the cow?
{41_2_0}Yes
No
----------x----------
A few days later...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It happened just like
that. We don't know
why, but he's gone.{NextPage_49}
Did you come to...?
It was my turn to
go, man...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...But your son did
everything he could.{NextPage_49}
The farm is fine, and
his wife and son...{NextPage_49}
Oh, your son has
decided what to do.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Forget-Me-Not Valley
is quieter now, but
everyone is fine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When did you come
here for the fist
time...? {32_7_208}{NextPage_49}
And when did your
son come here...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your son made your
dream come true...
Are you happy?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll come to see you
guys soon, so let's
run a farm together.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He decided to{32_3_232}
follow his father's
footsteps. {32_3_232}
He's working hard to
learn about farming.{32_3_232}
...He's just like
your son when he
first came here. {32_3_232}
It's kinda funny... {32_7_208}
----------x----------
Well, but {CharName_1}
grew up here.{32_1_244}
He knows what to do.{32_3_232}
He might become a
better farmer than
his father.{32_1_244}
It could happen,
you know. {32_7_208}
----------x----------
Do you think he'll
get mad if I said
that...? {32_1_244}
He might haunt me...{32_3_232}
Sorry, {CharName_0}.{32_3_232}
You did well...{32_5_220}
Really well...{32_7_208}
----------x----------
He decided to follow
his father's
footsteps. {32_3_232}
He seems to like
growing crops...{32_7_208}
----------x----------
He's getting along
with {CharName_38}.{32_3_232}
{CharName_38} said
good things about
{CharName_1}, too.{32_1_244}
He'll make some crops
{CharName_0} never
made before...{32_3_232}
----------x----------
An odd one is living
on the farm now.{32_0_100}
{CharName_38} is the
name, and if you feed
him seeds or crops,{NextPage_1}he'll make new crops.{32_7_208}
{CharName_1} started
making unique crops
with him right away.{32_7_208}
----------x----------
I kind of want him to
put more effort on
his animals...{32_3_232}
But...{32_3_232}
It's alright...{32_7_208}
----------x----------
He's a pretty good
singer, did you know?{32_15_160}
...I've never heard
{CharName_0} singing.{32_15_160}
You were...
terrible...{32_3_232}
You sounded like a
dinosaur...{32_7_208}
He must have taken
after {CharName_73}.{32_7_208}
{CharName_8} was
surprised, too.{32_15_160}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} is
{CharName_20}'s buddy
now... They made a{NextPage_1}little band.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He left for a
concert tour with
his son. {CharName_20}
is a traveler, so...
They might not come
back here anymore...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He was interested in
art. He became a good
friend of {CharName_21}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know too much
about it, but he had
many ideas.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He just left one day.
{CharName_73} was
very surprised...{32_7_208}
It's just the time of
his life...{32_7_208}
I kind of understand
how he feels...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} wrote
to {CharName_73} one day.{NextPage_1}"I'm looking for my
shape..."{32_7_208}
Artists tend to think
differently...
I have no idea...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He decided to live
as an athlete.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_11} introduced
him to a club.{32_7_208}
...{CharName_12} told me
later {CharName_1}'s
ability is different
than {CharName_13}'s, so
{CharName_11} decided
to leave him with
his friend.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I saw his debut match
on TV.{32_3_232}
What's that sport...?
It's like baseball,
but a bit different.{32_3_232}
A pitcher is next to
a batter...{32_3_232}
He made a big hit,
but it was foul.
Whatever that means.{32_3_232}
...Oh, it's called
"Pesapallo".{32_3_232}
His team lost that
day, but they'll do
well...{32_7_208}
...Do I sound like
his father...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He loved to read.
{CharName_73} told
me all about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He was helping {CharName_19}
with his experiments
sometimes.{32_3_232}
...He was used as a
guinea pig, more
like...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Anyway, he started
saying he wants to go
to the university.{32_58_152}
{CharName_73} was worried
about money, but he
got a scholarship!{32_5_220}
Pretty impressive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} wrote
to me the other day.{32_3_232}
"I'm inventing a
robot," he said.{32_5_220}
{CharName_19} had a
weird influence on
him, so...{32_1_244}
I'm worried he might
keep making junk...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wanted to go to see
you first and enjoy
watching the farm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But now your grandson
is taking over,
I can retire...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_73} is
doing well...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}They'll keep running
the farm together
from now on.{32_3_232}
Please watch over
them with your son.{32_11_184}
----------x----------
I wanted to go to see
you first and enjoy
watching the farm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_73} will keep
running the farm with
a memory of your son.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was gonna retire,
but I guess I can't.{32_3_232}
I can't let {CharName_73}
work by herself...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{41_2_0}Let's jump in!
Next time.
----------x----------
A few days later...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}He wasn't unhappy.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
But he didn't seem
to have a direction
in life. {35_0}{NextPage_49}
{35_2}One day,{32_1_44}I went to
see him.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
{35_0}I told him about the
farm you left to him.{NextPage_49}
{35_2}Your son didn't seem
to know much about
farming, but he was{NextPage_1}willing to give it
a try.{35_0}{NextPage_49}
{35_2}So I brought him to
Forget-Me-Not Valley.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}A few days later...{NextPage_49}
As you always wished,
he started working on
the farm with me.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Chop the tree?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
...!?{32_3_32}
----------x----------
{36_1}     {_28}{_04}{32_11_184}
----------x----------
{36_1}    {_28}{05_50}{_0b}{_b8}

----------x----------
{36_1}    {_28}{_08}{32_11_184}
----------x----------
{36_1}     {_28}{_09}{32_11_184}
----------x----------
You can't enter with
an item in your hand.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{41_2_0}Go after.
Forget it.
----------x----------
...Your son must have
had something else he
wanted to do.{NextPage_49}
It's alright...
You've gotta live
your own life...{NextPage_0}
