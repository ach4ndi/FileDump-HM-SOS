Oh, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_1}We're about to start our New Year's
celebration. Won't you join us?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you all for coming today.
I hope you all have a wonderful time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you all for coming today.
I wish you all a very Happy New Year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pardon me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Excuse me, {CharName_0}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You probably shouldn't have your shop
open if you don't have anything to sell.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, if you don't have anything to sell,
I guess there's no point in shopping here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you'd just bring something to sell,
I'd be happy to buy it from you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you, I'm just looking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Not much here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No, I'm just looking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I rather like the {29_0}, but
how much is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
{50_8_0_3}My goodness. Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll take it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh dear, that's too bad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello {CharName_0}.
I'm usually not busy, so feel free
to stop by for a visit any time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_9}I'm feeling a bit under the weather
today. I don't feel much like talking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_9}Could you please leave me alone?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_2}You're starting to annoy me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_2}I'm not feeling well today.
I'd rather not talk right now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_58}Good morning.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_58}Good day.
I try to take walks occasionally.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_58}Good day.
I take strolls occasionally.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_58}Good evening.
I've got to get back home.
I'm hungry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_58}Oh, hello {CharName_0}.
You're out late tonight.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_58}Good evening.
Don't you get sleepy staying up
so late?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_58}Oh, hello {CharName_0}.
Thank you for coming.
Make yourself at home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_58}My, what you doing out so late?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_58}Oh hello, {CharName_0}.
How are you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_58}My goodness, is that for me?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_3}Heeheehee...
Why that's one of my favorites.
Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_57}It looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_58}Hm? What is that you've got?
It looks interesting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_10}That's one of my weaknesses...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, that doesn't look very good, does it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_4}Ugh! Please take it away!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_4}None of that for me, thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_2}Why are you doing this to an old woman?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_57}Hm? What is that?
It doesn't look very interesting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No, I don't need that, thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_3}What an adorable child.
He looks a lot like you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_3}Say “Hello Auntie Romana.”
Come on... You can do it...
{34_1_57}{50_8_0_0}...........Doesn't talk much, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Any child of yours and Marlin's has to be
smart. I'm sure of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_3}What a healthy looking child.
Looks a lot like you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Any child of yours and Rock's has to be
healthy and strong. I'm sure of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_3}What a well-behaved child.
Looks a lot like Gustafa.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Any child of yours and Gustafa's has to be
funny. I'm sure of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dogs certainly are cute, but
I'm more of a cat person, myself...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can your dog do any tricks?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a good doggie.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cats don't like it if you bother them too
much. And yet they do follow you a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just love little kitty cats.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cats are nice, aren't they?
They're so relaxed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Am I the only person who
feels like chasing a duck every
time I see one walking by?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, what a plump duck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_57}It looks delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be sure to show me what that
grows into.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if that would grow in my garden.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you grow that?
It looks very fresh and delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that milk from {24_2}Farm?
I'll bet it's very fresh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk looks quite fresh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that cheese?
{24_2}Farm's original cheese?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess there are lots of kinds of cheese.
I don't really know anything about that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese looks delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sebastian knows a great deal
about cheese, you know.
He's quite a cook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that butter yourself?
Is it called “{24_2}Butter”?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've been trying to cut down on
fatty foods recently.
At least Sebastian says I should.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dishes cooked with butter are delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_58}Could I have that butter?
All right, please give it to
Sebastian.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did one of your chickens lay that egg?
It looks very fresh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love egg dishes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, well. I didn't know you could
catch fish like that around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that an edible fish?
But raw? No thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take it away. It smells all fishy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_58}My, did you find that around here?
Is it edible?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_2}That plant could be poisonous,
you know.{50_8_0_3} Hee hee.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an odd plant.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, did you make that for me?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_10}Well, thank you very much indeed.
I'll take it then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_2}Oh, I see.
Well, why don't you eat it yourself
then?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing with that hoe?
There's no point in trying to till
the soil around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Off to work in the fields?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please don't wave that thing around
here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, that sickle's still somewhat new.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You shouldn't wander around with that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've used that sickle quite a lot.
Take good care of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you think of that watering can?
Do you like it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_10}That's good.
I knew that you'd like it.
Yes sir.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_9}{34_1_57}Hmm. It is a strange shape, I'll admit.
But if you'd use it, I'm sure you'll get
to like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's the watering can I gave you.
It may be strangely shaped, but I
think you'll find it easy to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's the watering can I gave you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Use it well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, did you get a new watering can?
It looks like you haven't used it much.
Don't forget to water your plants.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you've used a watering can for a
long time, it becomes like a part of you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I may not look it, but people called me a
master of watering in my day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's no point in using that here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Goodness, what an old watering can.
But I bet it's very easy to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That watering can has been used a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I was a little girl, I had to milk
the cows by hand. Things certainly
are more convenient nowadays.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There aren't any cows around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you use that to shear your sheep?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe you should use that to cut
Cody's hair. {34_1_59}Heh heh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those must make shearing sheep easier.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've certainly used those clippers for a
long time. They must be well made.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_57}Don't you have anything more
interesting to show me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where are you going with that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, what an unusual stone.
That might be rather valuable.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that stone for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_10}Thank you.
I'll treasure it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_57}{50_8_0_2}Oh... Hmph...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's kind of dusty for an antique.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you find that around here?
Sebastian often takes strolls, so maybe
he'd know more about that than me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if that's edible.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_58}My, isn't that a record?
How unusual.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of record is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I used to listen to records a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that some kind of spice?
My, I bet you could make some very
tasty dishes with that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_57}I wonder what it tastes like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}{50_8_0_12}{34_1_58}Hm? What was that sound?
Was it that drum?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}{50_8_0_12}What an odd drum.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess Wally won that in some kind
of race.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Doesn't Wally want that anymore?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an odd necklace. I bet there's
an interesting history behind it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's not really my taste, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that Lumina's
sheet music?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did Lumina give it to you?
Since she can't play herself
she gave it to you, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I cannot play.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet that firecracker would be pretty
if you set it off.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We should set that off sometime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a present for someone?
I certainly don't need it, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Who are you going to give that to?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's no point in showing that to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I came here to live out my golden years
in peace and quiet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just between you and me...
I'm rather fond of practical jokes.
I like to play jokes on the people here.{NextPage_49}
You'd better watch out, too. Heh heh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You remind me of my dear husband.
It happened long ago, but...{NextPage_49}
I once went on a cruise on a great
ocean liner. But the ship sank.
I was the only one who survived.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everyone lives with many memories
of their past.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_10}That thing you gave me
was just heavenly.
That's one of my favorites!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_57}{50_8_0_2}I guess it's a little late to say this,
but I really can't stand that thing
that you gave me a while ago.{NextPage_49}
Did you know that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me was
pretty good.
I'd love some more sometime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_10}The {29_0} you gave me was great!
That was the best {29_0} I've
ever tasted!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_10}The {29_0} you gave me was
one of my favorite foods.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me
certainly tasted nutritious.
It might be good for babies.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_10}That milk you gave me
was just fantastic.
It was really very good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me
tasted pretty good, but it might
be even better made into cheese.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me
tasted just fantastic. You simply
have to try making cheese with it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me was rich and
very delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me tasted pretty
good, but I think it would be even
better made into butter.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me tasted
just wonderful. But it might be
a little rich for me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave me was
rich and very delicious.
I'd love some more...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave me was a little
smelly. But I could get to like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter you gave me was
rich and very delicious.
I'd love some more...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter you gave me was a little
smelly. It's a little too much for me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me was
one of my favorite foods.
You made that, didn't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that dish you gave me?
You're not quite as good as
Sebastian.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That fish that you caught for me
tasted just wonderful.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That wild plant that you gave me
was one of my favorites.
Feel free to give me some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That wild plant that you gave me
was pretty good when Sebastian
cooked it for me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're working hard, aren't you?
{50_8_0_10}You've become quite a
farmer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're quite good at growing crops,
aren't you?
I think you have natural talent.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that you're very good at
cooking.
I think you have natural talent.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're working hard with your animals.
Yes, you look somehow more mature...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Growing crops must be difficult.
But I can tell you're doing your best.
One look at your arms tells me that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you often cook at home?
I've heard that you're a very good cook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess you've gotten used to working
on the farm?
You seem somehow more relaxed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've gotten used to growing crops,
I guess?{NextPage_1}That's good.
----------x----------
I've heard that you're quite a
good cook.
I'd love to taste your cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This area has changed a great deal.
Why, when Sebastian and I came here, there
weren't any other houses here at all.{NextPage_49}
But soon the farm across the river came,
and then Wally and his family.{NextPage_49}
And those... strange ones.
You know -- Kassey, Patrick and Cody.
They came around the same time.{NextPage_49}
Then the inn and the bar were built.
It's pretty active around here nowadays.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Speaking of which, your farm has actually
been here for quite a long time.{NextPage_49}
But its owner went off somewhere and left
it empty for a long time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lumina was so small when she came to
live here, but she's grown so big now.
It's hard to believe.{NextPage_49}
She's my granddaughter, but something
happened and I had to take care
of her, you see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why, I think I could nod off
right here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm feeling rather sleepy all
of a sudden.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.....................................
.....................................
.....................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_10}I feel so relaxed here.
Good drinks and good music.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_25}Don't tell Sebastian that you
saw me here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah, I feel good today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I sometimes get a little lonely,
living in this big old house.
That's why I love having visitors.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Recently getting around has gotten harder
for me. But I do try to take walks when
the weather is nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you're free, please come and
visit us.
But I guess you're quite busy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I sometimes like to pay many different
people a visit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're always welcome here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I try to take walks on days like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It feels good to get out once in a while.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's been so hot recently.
But I'm sure it's nothing compared to
how hot it is in the city.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
At this time of year, the forest is the
most comfortable place to be.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Walking is very good for you, as long
as you don't overdo it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please come to see us at the
Villa sometime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My joints bother me at this
time of year.
Getting old is no picnic.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It certainly is cold today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This weather isn't good for people my age.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
She practices a lot, so I'm sure
she'll improve.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love the piano myself.
I used to play when I was younger.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I see Lumina playing the piano,
I remember my childhood.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Shhh!
She's playing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you think?
Doesn't Lumina sound a bit better?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that a nice song?
I love that one.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I should start charging admission...
{50_8_0_26}Heheheh...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh dear, to think that I have to subject
myself to the services of this quack
doctor. Getting old is no fun.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I keep telling him that there's
nothing wrong with me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Getting old is not for the faint of heart.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've never liked doctors.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did I ever tell you?
I'm having a little contest with that
quack.{NextPage_49}
Hm? What kind of contest?
Isn't it obvious? We're seeing who's
going to kick the bucket first!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I forget to mention it, but in my contest
with that quack, the one who dies first
is the loser. And I hate losing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't mind dying, but I'll be darned if
I'm going to let that quack beat me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I always play to win, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You remember the contest I told you about?
I bet I'll live longer than Dr Hardy.
A doctor can't operate on himself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've been saddled with that quack since
before I moved here. I keep telling him
I'm fine, but he insists on examining me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That Dr Hardy has guts, I'll give him
that. Imagine, competing with me.
I never lose, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dr. Hardy is more stubborn than I thought.
Well, two can play at this game.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come to think of it, you've
gotten older too, haven't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_25}I'm busy snacking at the moment.
Please be quiet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_25}I told you not to talk to me.
If Sebastian hears you, he'll catch
me snacking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_2}I said be quiet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Kate is interviewing me at the moment. She
said she's going to write a book about me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what kind of book it'll be.
I think I'd make a great tragic heroine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be sure to read the book when it
gets published.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_59}I'm looking forward to it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Kate is interviewing me at the moment. She
said she's going to write a book about me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It seems to be taking a very long time.
It must be a quite a book she's writing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope she finishes it while I'm
still alive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I see.
But I really shouldn't now...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This weather isn't good for walking.
This is a sun umbrella, you know.
A parasol.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It can be slippery around here.
Watch your step.{NextPage_1}.
----------x----------
.........Lumina.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well done. You can play the music
just as it's written on the page.
But try to be a little more creative, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I suppose you think there's no point in an
old lady like me having nice things, eh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I'm just joking.{NextPage_1}....{32_1_244}
Go ahead and look.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No, that's not for sale.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wouldn't think so.
It's one of a kind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess you could say that.
She was very fond of Ronet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Anyway, it's not for sale.
Why don't you move along?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's no point if it's not for sale.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I never said she was Ronet's apprentice.
I just said she liked Ronet.
Isn't that right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_10}Don't you worry, I will.
But even if you do come back with a lot
of money, I'll tell you the same thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_10}Oh, that Van's a character!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_0}...{32_1_244}
There was something I wanted to be sure
and tell you. Now what was it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah!
Oh, {32_1_244}that's right.
I have something for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was cleaning out the closet when I
found one of my old watering cans.
You've got fields at your farm, right?{NextPage_49}
So I thought I'd give it to you.
It's all right. It's still usable.
Sebastian! Sebastian!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Will you bring the watering can that
we found in the closet over to
{CharName_0}'s farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I used to use it for watering flowers
long ago.{NextPage_49}
It's shaped kind of strangely,
but it's very easy to use.
I'm sure you'll like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you.{32_1_244}
Very good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's nothing but an old watering can,
but I hope it'll be of some use to you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_0}You'll have to excuse me
for visiting you like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_0}But this cat showed up at my
doorstep a while ago.{32_1_244}
I already have two cats, you see...{NextPage_49}
But I can't bear to throw him out.{32_1_244}
So I thought maybe you'd like to have him.
What do you think?{41_2_0}Keep it.
Refuse.
----------x----------
{50_8_0_1}Heeheehee. {32_1_244}I knew you'd say
yes!{NextPage_1}All right. Take good care of him.
Oh, {32_1_244}that's right.
You've got to think of a name...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_8_0_7}Oh... {32_1_244}But he's such a cute kitty...
I see.{32_1_244} Oh well...{32_1_244}

Take good care of him!

Who would have thought she would have

{CharName_27}, please sing something
for our departed friend.{NextPage_0}

I have to be going to bed soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's my bedtime.
Could you be moving along?{NextPage_0}

Good night. Shoo!{NextPage_0}

I'm going to be leaving soon.{NextPage_0}
