\u1f41\u1fae\u1f48\u2136I love it here down by the\u2328river.\u232bThe sound of water, the\u2328fresh scent of greenery...\u232b\u1f41\u1fae\u1f49\u2136Whenever I need to calm\u2328down or I'm feeling blue,\u2328this is where I come.
\u1f41\u1fae\u1f4c\u2136Oh, you can't imagine me\u2328losing my calm, huh...?\u232b\u1f41\u1fae\u1f48\u2136Well, of course I do.\u232bA lot of people think I'm so\u2328even-tempered, but nobody\u2328is calm all the time.\u232b\u1f41\u1fae\u1f4c\u2136A lot of times I get really\u2328nervous that I'll let people\u2328down.\u232b\u1f41\u1fae\u1f4b\u2136Especially when they need\u2328something difficult from me.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fae\u1f49\u2136And sometimes I panic when\u2328I'm in too much of a rush to\u2328get everything done.
\u1f41\u1fae\u1f48\u2136And would you believe, as\u2328a kid I was never calm!\u2328I was a little wildcat!\u232bThe river certainly wasn't a\u2328place for me to be calm in\u2328those days!
\u1f41\u1fae\u1f48\u2136It was a place to play and\u2328throw rocks and be wild!\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fae\u1f49\u2136When I was trying to catch\u2328fish, I'd dive right in\u2328after them!
\u1f41\u1fae\u1f49\u2136Ha ha!\u2328Is it that surprising?
\u2332 You're not who I thought.\u2328 A new side to you. Neat!
\u1f41\u1fae\u1f4c\u2136Really? Sorry about that.\u232b\u1f41\u1fae\u1f4a\u2136But this responsible person\u2328you think of me as...\u232bIsn't that just an image you\u2328came up with on your own?\u232bIt's a drag when somebody\u2328forces their image on you.\u232b\u1f41\u1fae\u1f4b\u2136...Wow, I probably said\u2328too much there.\u232bI guess I'm going to call it\u2328a day. Bye!
\u1f41\u1fae\u1f4d\u2136Y-You really think so? I'm\u2328glad to hear you say that.
\u1f41\u1fae\u1f4d\u2136Oh, I know...\u232b\u1f41\u1fae\u1f49\u2136That's right!\u2328\u232a, why don't you tell\u2328me about yourself!\u232bI'd love to know more about\u2328you.\u232b\u1f41\u1fae\u1f4d\u2136It's unfair that you know\u2328all about me and I don't\u2328know anything about you.
\u1f41\u1fae\u1f49\u2136Ha ha!\u2328Why don't you come with me\u2328to Yun's Tea House?\u232bYou can tell me all about\u2328yourself while we eat.\u232b\u1f41\u1fae\u1f48\u2136Let's go, \u232a!
