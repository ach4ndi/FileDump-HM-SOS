{50_1_0_35}{34_1_167}People always like
brighter guys.
Don't you agree? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_168}{50_1_0_35}"Just be yourself."
Sometimes that's
not so clear to me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_169}{50_1_0_12}I wonder if I've
changed since
I was little. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}{34_1_167}People always like
cheerful guys.
Don't you agree? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_168}{50_1_0_35}"Just be yourself."
Sometimes that's
not so clear to me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_169}{50_1_0_12}I wonder if I've
changed since
I was little. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}When you were a kid,
did you always wake
up early too?{NextPage_49}
{41_2_0}Of course.
He oversleeps.
----------x----------
{34_1_165}{50_1_0_3}Right!
Do you think I can
grow bigger if I go{NextPage_1}to bed and get up
early?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_166}{50_1_0_9}Really? You were a
bad boy! {50_1_0_1}I'll go to
bed and get up early{NextPage_1}to become a model
citizen!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_10}I'm a good boy! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I want to become a
great adult some
day. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I should be like
{CharName_14}! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I'm able to decide
what I want from
my life... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_169}{50_1_0_35}I always wonder why
we have things like
rules... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_168}{50_1_0_35}I don't ever want
to grow-up. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I think I've finally
come to understand...{NextPage_49}
Rules really are
important. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}Everyday it's
the same thing. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_1}But it's life's
simple routines
that are precious... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I think that all
people should see
the world at least{NextPage_1}once.
in their lives. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_1}Do you know the world
outside the Valley? {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_7}{34_1_168}All I know is this
valley... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, are you getting
proper rest?
{41_2_0}Not really...
You bet!
----------x----------
{34_1_168}{50_1_0_9}You always need to
get enough rest. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_25}You're getting on
in years, you know. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I see.
{50_1_0_9}Try not to push
yourself too hard. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_25}You're not as young
as you used to be. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Time is money.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I wonder what my
purpose in life is...{NextPage_49}
I've been pondering
that a lot lately. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I've been thinking
about how I'm going
to have to make some{NextPage_1}pretty serious
decisions and plans
about my life. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is work hard
{41_2_0}Of course!
Not really...
----------x----------
{34_1_167}{50_1_0_9}I see.
Grown-ups have it
rough sometimes. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_12}Is that so? {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_0}I always thought
that work was
supposed to be hard. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_12}Are you slacking off?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's normal to be
tired after
working hard. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Have a good day at
work! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I hope I make a
difference.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}You need to have
rules in a society.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's important
to be on time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are your goals
in life?
{41_3_0}A bigger farm.
This is it!
To be rich.
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Oh, really?
It's always good to
have goals in life.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_168}{50_1_0_9}What do you mean
this is it? {NextPage_49}
You still have
plenty of time.{NextPage_49}
If you don't have
goals there's no
point in living. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_13}Tsk, well what else
should I have
expected from you...{NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_25}But I know there is
something else you
really dream of... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}Keep your body
healthy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}Eat 3 meals a day. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}Hey, get more rest.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_36}I'm so bored...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_165}{50_1_0_26}I scraped my
hands up again... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_166}{50_1_0_4}I'll never let you
have my treasure,
you evil monster! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_169}{50_1_0_4}What's your problem,
old man!? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_13}Adults don't really
understand how
I feel. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_169}{50_1_0_4}I'm already an
adult! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_168}{50_1_0_9}I wish I could go
back to being a
kid again. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}There's nothing fun
to do around here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}I need to do
something to get my
blood moving again. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_167}{50_1_0_25}She is mad at me
again.{NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_4}She's always nagging!
{41_3_0}Who's a nag?!
You deserve it.
She is strict.
----------x----------
{50_1_0_4}So now you're angry
at me too?
Jerk! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}Yeah she is!
{50_1_0_12}How could you
marry a witch?! {NextPage_49}
You must have been
out of your mind!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_10}I've got wings! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_10}I can call the wind!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_2}Who cares about
rules? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_169}{50_1_0_2}Is it wrong to be
self-centered? {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_4}I'm tired of looking
at everyone else! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_169}{50_1_0_2}What do you want? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_168}{50_1_0_9}Sorry but I can't
live a life that is
bound by time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I'll do what I want,
when I want.
{34_1_170}That's the life. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}Just go with the
flow... {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_1}Don't push yourself
too hard... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}If you and Mom
home, I'd play
outside instead {NextPage_1}of going to sleep
at night. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_167}{50_1_0_35}I wonder what it's
like in a world with
no clocks... {NextPage_1}{50_1_0_1}I'd like to know. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_168}{50_1_0_2}I want to be able to
stand on my own
soon. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_2}It'd be better if
people just did what
they wanted to do... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Can't be too worried
about time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_168}{50_1_0_7}Relationships with
people are very
complex. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}Okay, whatever... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_167}{50_1_0_12}Am I very lady-like?
{50_1_0_9}At least that's what
Kate told me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_2}Are you making
fun of me? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_168}{50_1_0_7}It would probably be
better if I was
never born. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}A guy like me is
better behind the
scenes. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_168}{50_1_0_7}There's nobody out
there for me...
Hah... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_12}Do you think I'm
a good boy?
{41_3_0}Aren't you?
You're a bad boy.
What do you think?
----------x----------
{34_1_165}{50_1_0_3}Yup!
I'm a good boy!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_167}{50_1_0_9}Um...bad...?
But it's better to
be good, right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_167}{50_1_0_9}Hmm...I dunno...?
I could be good,
or bad...? {NextPage_1}{50_1_0_3}It doesn't matter
to me! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I don't mind being
bad but... {NextPage_1}{50_1_0_9}I don't want to grow
up to be a bad
person. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_167}{50_1_0_35}It's definitely
better to be a
good boy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_167}{50_1_0_35}If I'm a good boy,
people won't get
mad at me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_4}Just leave me alone! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_4}Stop treating me
like a child! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_4}Adults are SO dumb! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_168}{50_1_0_9}What does it mean
to "know yourself"? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}No matter what,
people have to live
their lives within {NextPage_1}certain limits. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Life is so much
easier when it's
a set routine. {NextPage_49}
At least that's
what I've come
to believe. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_167}{50_1_0_9}I don't think I'll
ever be a good boy
to everyone. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_167}{50_1_0_9}Sometimes I feel
people don't like
me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_2}Doesn't matter...
I'm a loser
anyway... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_168}{50_1_0_2}I don't know what
they mean by
"childlike" or {NextPage_1}"manly" at all.
I'm just me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_26}I think I understand
what it means to be
an adult... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}Relationships with
others are a very
special thing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_36}I wonder how I'll
play today... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_165}{50_1_0_3}There's a treasure
rotting somewhere in
my room! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_4}I'll waste away if
I stay on this farm
forever... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_4}Don't worry about
me at all! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}Now and then I think
I had a good
childhood. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Suddenly I just
want to shout out. {NextPage_49}
It reminds me of
when I was a kid. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_30}{34_1_166}{23} has a cavity
too! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Owls are nocturnal
creatures, so you can
only hear them {NextPage_1}hoot at night! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_3}Even dogs have some
sensibility. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_3}Near the ocean is a
huge land turtle! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_2}I think it would be
better if you studied
more about animals. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}Deep in the forest
is a multitude of
wild beasts. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I'm studying what
you should do to
make delicious milk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I've got to think of
more ways to improve
{24_2}Farm... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}Maybe it would be
best to move our
operations towards {NextPage_1}more of an
automatic approach. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}Maybe people could
find another use for
animal waste... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I'm confident that
I can run a better
farm than you! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}{CharName_19} told me
some farms use all
machines to operate.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_3}Shouldn't you be
retiring?
{50_1_0_26}Just kidding... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_4}I'm gonna make this
farm more advanced!{NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_1}{CharName_19} says we
should use more
machines.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}There's an owl
in the woods at
night! {NextPage_49}
He lives in a
big tree. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_3}{CharName_8}'s cats
answer when I call
them!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I figured out how a
turtle moves!
Maybe... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}{34_1_167}I get the feeling
that {23} is
making a fool of me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_2}I think I understand
what animals are
feeling better. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_2}I feel the animal
like me the most
in my family. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_3}If you put all your
heart into looking
after your animals, {NextPage_49}
they will return the
feeling 10 times
over! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_3}Hey, you know
you could retire or
just keep working. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_25}I could handle
things even though
I lack any {NextPage_1}real experience! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_170}{50_1_0_1}I'm understanding
things from the
animals' mindset. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_13}I'm serious... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}I've never thought
that I was an animal
too before... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}There's still so
much for me to
learn... {NextPage_49}
Both about the
farm and the
animals. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I wonder if {CharName_7}
would take me into
the city with him. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_1}It's good to
learn all sorts of
things. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}I often hear how
it's experience
not knowledge that {NextPage_1}benefits a farm
owner... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_7}{34_1_168}I need to study
more...{NextPage_49}
If I don't, then
you'll never be
able to retire. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_3}The pasture grass
is filled with
living energy! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_166}{50_1_0_3}Deep in the fields
is some dark soil! {NextPage_49}
It's definitely
good soil! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Black soil is the
best. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_167}{50_1_0_35}The light from
Mr. Sun is a
precious gift. {NextPage_49}
It's the same for
humans and animals. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_2}Too much nutrition
causes warped
growth... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Crops grown outside
are better than
greenhouse ones.{NextPage_49}
They taste
better too! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I'm thinking of a
more efficient way
to cultivate crops. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_4}I heard the
"Hybrid Crops" are in
the city. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_3}I'd like to take a
look at something
like that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I'd like to try
using a cultivator. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_4}I heard the
"Hybrid Crops" are in
the city. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_3}I'd like to take a
look at something
like that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I want to put more
energy into growing
crops. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_1}I'm curious to know
what a Bio-form is. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_12}{CharName_19} might know
more about it...{NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_1}Maybe I'll go ask
him about it... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{CharName_29}
I've got to learn
more from {CharName_29}
about crops... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I was just thinking
it would be good if
we could somehow {NextPage_1}find another use
for animal waste. {NextPage_49}
{CharName_19} knows a lot
about material
recycling. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_12}I'll try talking
to him about it... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think I've figured
out a way to recycle
animal waste. {NextPage_49}
Maybe...{NextPage_49}
I've got to look
up a few more
things first...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_3}I can smell good soil
now! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_166}{50_1_0_3}I memorized
where to find the
wild plants! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I think I know which
flowers bloom in
which season. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I'm trying
to become good at
raising plants. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_2}Even if you get good
at raising crops,
it's not cool. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_2}There's no way
people are going to
say that I smell {NextPage_1}like veggies and
farm animals! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}There's a sense of
attachment to
farm tools. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}A proper amount of
patience is needed
for farming. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}It's more important
to enjoy the process
then to worry about {NextPage_1}all the waiting that
has to be done. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}"Delicious things
take time."{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, McCoy G is an
amazing songwriter!
Do you know him?
{41_3_0}McCoy who?
Of course!
I'm better!
----------x----------
{34_1_166}{50_1_0_30}You don't know?!
{50_1_0_1}He's so famous he's
even in books!{NextPage_1}{50_1_0_9}Your not too
knowledgeable! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_165}Yeah, he's so
famous, isn't he? {NextPage_49}
I wanna take a look
at his famous
instrument.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_13}No way... You can
only whistle with
your fingers... {NextPage_49}
McCoy G can play all
types of cool
instruments! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I want a flute that
sounds like an
owl's hoot! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}The sound of the
waterfall is not
always the same! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}McCoy G is an
expert at playing
the Ogracci. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}If you were an
instrument,
you'd be a bell. {NextPage_49}
That's just my
opinion. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}I want a 7-octave
voice... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_2}I get kind of
annoyed when I
hear your voice... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}Sometimes {CharName_27}'s
guitar needs to be
tuned. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{CharName_8}'s piano isn't
that much of an
antique... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Music is kind of
like a puzzle. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}There are also songs
where one person
uses two voices. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_9}That can't be good
for the vocal cords. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I just thought of a
great melody, but it
escaped me... {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_9}Hmmm...{34_1_168} {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_26}Listening to {CharName_9}
play piano makes me
want to hum along. {NextPage_49}
I feel embarrassed
to do it, so I
unconsciously stop. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I think there's a
special element in
soothing music...{NextPage_49}
I'll go ask {CharName_19}
what he thinks. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}There's got to be
some kind of secret
in soothing music... {NextPage_49}
I'll go ask {CharName_19}
about it next time...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Performing music and
connecting with
other people's {NextPage_1}hearts and souls
looks like a lot
of fun. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I feel great when I
sing out loud! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}The body moves
automatically if it
hears good music! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}If I hear the same
rhythm over and over,
I get sleepy... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_26}The body responds to
rhythm. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}I want to listen to
other records... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_24}A...a...u... {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_2}I can't sing high
anymore...
Darn. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}It'd be nice to
express my feelings
through music {NextPage_1}instead of always
using words. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I think my voice
changes when I sing. {NextPage_49}
It feels like my
whole body is
shaking when I sing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}When you change the
performer, you
change the feeling {NextPage_1}someone gets
from the song. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Someone said people
who don't perform
their own music lack{NextPage_1}a sense of
originality. {NextPage_49}
But I have to
disagree. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I memorized lots
of color types!
Indigo, Sienna...
{41_3_0}Indigo?
Sienna?
What about Lavender?
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}It's dark blue/
purple with a hint
of gray!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}It's kind of a fuzzy
looking reddish
brown color! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}It's a beautiful
light pink-purple
color right? {NextPage_49}
Wow, you know
a lot, Dad!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Things are pretty
when they're
symmetrical! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}If you mix lights of
different colors
together, you'll get{NextPage_1}white! That's so
mysterious! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}I heard that the
bronze statue,
"The Thinker" is {NextPage_1}actually staring out
at the afterlife.
{50_1_0_27}That's scary. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}It's not easy to
draw pictures of
animals. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I wonder what the
most beautiful thing
in the world is? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I wonder why {CharName_21}
makes art out
of metal... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}It's said that
aesthetics varies
by the person. {NextPage_49}
I get the feeling
that there's a
principle behind it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}The female body is
so beautiful. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_26}I-I'm no pervert!
I was just talking
about the shape! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}You could say that
women's makeup is
a form of art. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Art isn't always
about showing it to
other people. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I want to see more
things around the
world. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I'm curious about
how the brain works
when someone thinks {NextPage_1}that something is
"beautiful."{NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_35}Maybe {CharName_19} can
help me out... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I wonder how the
brain is able to
take in knowledge {NextPage_1}and identify what
shapes are. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_1}I'll go ask {CharName_19}
about it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}People seem to talk
to themselves when
nobody is around... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}You know, I have
a talent for art! {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_13}I'm not kidding!
{50_1_0_10}Really! {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_25}I just shouldn't
show it to anyone
else yet! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_10}When I showed Mom
what I drew, she
was so happy! {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_25}Maybe I made her
too pretty... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}When I showed Mom her
picture I drew,
she was so happy! {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_25}{34_1_167}Maybe it's because I
drew it better than
in real life... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}It's fun to color
what you drew
yourself. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I wonder what color
I am now... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}Purple looks really
nice I think. {NextPage_1}Then again,
maybe not... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I think art is a
form of expression
for peoples souls. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}There's works of
art that make you
wonder if there's {NextPage_1}another existence
in the painting. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}There's no end to
the complexity and
deepness of art. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}Just because someone
can draw or paint
does not suddenly {NextPage_1}make them an
artist. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I want to become
left-handed! {NextPage_49}
Left-handed people
have many advantages,
I heard. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I want to be faster,
bigger, and
stronger! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{34_1_167}Can't train all
the time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}You know, I think my
reflexes might be
really good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_2}I don't want to be
all sweaty and
smelly... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_2}I don't want to
become too muscular.
Yuck! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}You'll get better
results if you
focus on one {NextPage_1}specific muscle when
training. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}Now and then I think
about training with
{CharName_11}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I don't think just
guts are enough to
exceed your limits. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_1}You also need to
view training on a
mental level. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I think that you
should learn how the
mind and body works{NextPage_1}in order to train
well and exceed your
own limits. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_1}Maybe {CharName_19} can
teach me more... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}The world is filled
with different types
of sports. {NextPage_49}
I think I might be
good at some of
them. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I want to try some
sports that require
strategies.{NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_35}I think I might
be good at them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I think I might be
good at sports that
require strategies.{NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_1}I'll go ask {CharName_11}
for advice. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}There's not much
appeal in sports
where only your {NextPage_1}strength decides
the match. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I want to be able to
jump higher! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}You know, I'm faster
than {CharName_16}! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I can run up the hill
by Grandma {CharName_8}'s
house easy now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I'm really good at
running.
Really. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}Sports stars get all
the babes.{NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_2}The country doesn't
have any though. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}Maybe I should try
some popular sports
in town. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Did you know my abs
are like a six-pack. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}Your body atrophies
quickly if you
stop training. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}{CharName_11} seems to be
a "no pain, no gain"
kind of teacher. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I wonder how much
you need to workout
to go pro...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Dad, is farm work
fun?
{41_3_0}Not at all.
It's fun.
Why ask?
----------x----------
{50_1_0_12}Oh, really?
{50_1_0_35}{34_1_167}I guess you can't
just like animals... {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_1}I guess work is
really hard! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Yeah, you're right!{NextPage_49}
The animals are so
cute, how can it not
be fun? {NextPage_49}
I want to be a
farmer too when I
grow up! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I like animals so I
thought I should be
a farmer! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Can't keep working
if I you don't
like animals! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_12}I see...
{50_1_0_35}It's more than just
liking animals huh...{NextPage_49}
{34_1_167}Hmm... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I knew it.
I want to be a
farmer too! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I like animals so I
thought I might try
being a farmer too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Animals are so cute. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}I think that being
a farmer takes a lot
more than just being {NextPage_1}able to like all
the animals. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}I'm kind of curious
about being a
farmer someday... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}Hey, Dad.
{50_1_0_35}What do you enjoy
most on the farm?
{41_3_0}The animals.
The money.
The food.
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I can understand.
You can just get
lost in their eyes. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_9}I do it myself
quite often. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}Huh? Is that so?
I never thought of
that... {NextPage_49}
Imagine a farm that
brings in a lot of
money... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}That's true. {NextPage_49}
You get to eat great
food before anyone
else does. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}It's normal for me
to be interested in
the farm. {NextPage_49}
I was brought up on
a farm after all. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}Hey, Dad.
{50_1_0_0}Do you want me to
be a farmer like {NextPage_1}you?
{41_3_0}Of course.
Not really.
Do your own thing.
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}That would be the
natural thing to
do... {NextPage_49}
I'll think about
it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Oh, really?
{50_1_0_35}I didn't expect
that... {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_26}That's fine. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I'm happy that you
think that way. {NextPage_49}
But, I was thinking
of trying out life
on the farm too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I think I'll try out
life as a farmer. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Dad, there's a
tree that closes
it's leaves up {NextPage_1}when it gets dark,
you know!
I want to see it! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Plants are
interesting. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_12}{34_1_167}I wonder if {CharName_29}'s
field has
grasshoppers? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_2}Plants can't ever
betray you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I wonder which is
easier... {NextPage_49}
Raising plants or
raising animals...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I'd like to try and
grow my own original
crop... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}I don't understand
the beauty in
dried flowers. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Dad, have you ever
seen {CharName_27} live
before?
{41_2_0}Of course.
Not yet.
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Hurray! Yeah!
I want to become a
grown-up soon! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}Really?
{50_1_0_1}I heard {CharName_27}
is amazing!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}People who can play
instruments are
totally cool. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}You're lucky...
I want to become a
grown-up soon... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Oh really?{NextPage_49}
I heard {CharName_27}'s
guitar can bring
tears to your eyes. {NextPage_49}
I want to hear it
sometime... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_2}I want to hear music
that floods me with
emotion... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I wonder what it's
like to live a life
without sounds... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{CharName_20}'s style
of music is called
"Healing". {NextPage_49}
It really relaxes
me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Can {CharName_9}
play other songs? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}What's the big
thingy in front of
{CharName_21}'s house?
{41_3_0}A lump of metal.
A work of art.
Didn't I tell you?.
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I see...
{50_1_0_35}It kind of catches
my interest. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_1}It doesn't look like
just a hunk of metal
to me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Really. {CharName_21}'s
must be in it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_12}Huh?
Oh, I guess I did. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_1}{34_1_167}No matter how
many times I
see it, {NextPage_49}
if I look at it, I'll
begin to wonder just
what it is... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Wow, to think that
he could make
something out of{NextPage_1}such immovable
material. {NextPage_49}
{CharName_21} really is
an amazing guy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Easy to understand
pictures are OK, but
so is abstract art. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}If I paint will this
fog in my head go
away...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}Artists are always
thinking of very
complex things. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}All art is created
first in the heart
of the artist. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Hey, Dad.
{CharName_11} is a lot faster
than you right?
{41_2_0}I guess.
I'm faster!
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I see. He is really
is something, isn't
he. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Really? You should
race him next time. {NextPage_49}
I'll be the
timekeeper. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}People who can run
fast are cool. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I'm thinking about
working-out myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I don't think my
arms will get any
bigger... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{CharName_13}'s shoes
have got to be
special. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_9}I guess the shoes
are important when
trying to excel? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}It feels good when
the body moves. {NextPage_49}
Gotta exercise a
little everyday.
That's the key. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Dad, how many number
places can you
handle?
{41_3_0}Not much.
At least three.
Any and all!
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}Geeze, if you can't
do at least the tens,
you're done for... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{34_1_166}Wow, that's good.
I can do up to
double digits. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}{34_1_166}Wow! Anything?!
Okay, okay... {NextPage_49}
What's 2,654 plus
398? {32_3_232}{31}
....................
{50_1_0_9}Um, Dad? Are you
feeling okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}I want to become
smarter. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I'm interested in
{CharName_19}'s research.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I wonder what my
IQ is. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I'd like to take a
look inside {CharName_19}'s
brain. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}At first it's easy
to think that {CharName_19}
is a little weird. {NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_1}It's uncanny how
much he knows... {NextPage_0}
