\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136It's a cat! But what's it\u2328doing over there...?
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136You're going to save it?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136Hey, w-wait!
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136It's wearing a collar.\u2328It must be lost.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Everything's going to be\u2328all right. Don't cry.\u232bHey, will you help me\u2328find its owner,\u2328\u232a?
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136Thanks!\u232bFirst, let's ask around, and\u2328see if anyone knows anything\u2328about this cat.
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135A lost cat?\u232b\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2135Hmm... I feel like I've\u2328seen that cat around here\u2328before...\u232b\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f4b\u2135Sorry... I can't remember\u2328anything more than that...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136It's OK. Sorry to bother\u2328you.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135Oh, don't worry about it!\u2328I hope you guys are able\u2328to find its owner!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Thanks...
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136All right, let's go ask\u2328someone else.
\u1f40\u1fac\u1f4c\u2135I reckon I've seen that\u2328cat somewhere before...\u232b\u1f40\u1fac\u1f4b\u2135But I can't rightly remember\u2328where...\u232b\u1f40\u1fac\u1f48\u2135I've got a hunch it was\u2328with one of our regulars\u2328at our shop.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136Really...?\u232b\u1f40\u1fac\u1f48\u2135I reckon so. I'll let y'all\u2328know if I remember anything\u2328else.\u232bI'd be glad to look after it\u2328for a while if y'all need.\u2328Just say the word!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Thanks a lot. We will.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136*sigh*... The search isn't\u2328going so well...
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136What'll happen to this\u2328cat if we can't find\u2328its owner?
\u2332 Let's put it back...\u2328 We can't give up now!
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4a\u2136Put it back...? You mean\u2328leave it by the river\u2328where we found it?\u232bThat's horrible! What\u2328kind of cold, uncaring\u2328person are you?!
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4a\u2136Never mind.\u2328I'll find the owner\u2328myself.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136Here, come with me...
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136Sorry I dragged you\u2328into this.\u232bSee you.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136You're right...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4d\u2136You know, just hearing you\u2328say that, I think everything\u2328will be all right.
Nico! Here, Nico!\u2328Where are you...?
Oh! It's you,\u2328Nico!\u232bThank goodness! You had\u2328me worried there!\u232bYou chased off after that\u2328bug and disappeared! I've\u2328been looking everywhere!\u232bWell, I'm just glad that\u2328you're all right!
Were you kids looking\u2328after him?\u2328\u232bThank you very much!\u2328I'm Nico's owner.\u2328
Oh dear! If we don't hurry,\u2328Nico and I will miss our\u2328ride out of town!\u232bI wanted to thank you\u2328somehow, but I don't have\u2328the time now. I'm sorry...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Oh no, don't worry about\u2328it. We're just glad we\u2328found his owner.
What nice kids you are!\u2328You'll have to excuse me,\u2328then. I have to go.\u232bLet's go, Nico!
Oh! Nico thanked you, too!
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4d\u2136Oh, uh...\u2328You're...welcome?
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136...\u270a\u270aWell, that was a bit\u2328of an adventure.\u232bAll's well that ends\u2328well, I guess.
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136A-Anyway...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136I'm so glad you were\u2328with me, \u232a...\u232bYou said everything would be\u2328all right, and it was...
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136You're always so positive,\u2328and it makes me feel\u2328the same way.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4d\u2136Thanks again, \u232a.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Anyway, it's getting late.\u2328Time always goes so quickly\u2328when I'm with you...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136I'll walk you home.\u2328Let's go, \u232a...
