\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136This spring has such a\u2328mysterious atmosphere about\u2328it...
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136I wonder if some sacred\u2328presence dwells here.
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Speaking of mysteries...\u232bAt the town hall I heard the\u2328girls relating the legend\u2328of the church bell.
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136It seems there is a church\u2328on the outskirts of Bluebell\u2328Village.\u232bThe church bell was once\u2328used to ring out the time,\u2328weddings, and so on.\u232bBut it became decrepit and\u2328fell into disuse for some\u2328time...\u232bAnd yet, even though the\u2328church was abandoned...\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f4c\u2136Couples who got married atop\u2328the mountain sometimes heard\u2328the sound of the bell...
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136They said it was a sign\u2328of the Harvest Goddess\u2328giving her blessing...\u232bNow legend says if a couple\u2328marry atop the mountain and\u2328hear the bell ring...\u232bThey'll be happy forever...\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f49\u2136Those girls certainly have\u2328a vivid imagination!\u2328It's a charming fancy.\u232bWhat do you think of this\u2328tale, \u232a?
\u2332 It's wonderful!\u2328 Fairytales mean nothing.
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f49\u2136You think so?\u2328Just the sort of girl I\u2328thought you were, then!\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f4c\u2136On that subject...do you\u2328have anyone you are hoping\u2328to marry someday?
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f49\u2136No?\u2328I am glad to hear that.\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136In that case, I hope...\u2328...\u270a...\u270a...\u270a\u270a\u1f41\u1faa\u1f4d\u2136No,\u2328the time for that is later.
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f49\u2136Pardon me.\u2328It's nothing at all.\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136But now, \u232a, let me\u2328see you home.\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f4d\u2136I want to spend that extra\u2328time with you as we go.
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f4c\u2136Mean nothing? You may be\u2328right.\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136You are a more practical-\u2328minded girl than I expected.\u232bNot that there's anything\u2328wrong with that.\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f4b\u2136But don't you think that\u2328you miss out on some of\u2328life that way?\u232bMusic, feelings...\u2328Not everything that matters\u2328is visible to the eye.\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Isn't it okay to sometimes\u2328have a daydream, or believe\u2328in a legend?\u232bFor myself, I believe so.
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136In any case, we should be\u2328getting back.\u2328Goodbye, \u232a.
