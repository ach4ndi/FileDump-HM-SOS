(Food)
Cows eat {13}{25_0_3}{17}. When the {13}{25_0_3}{17}
in their feedbox disappears, put more in.{NextPage_49}
If half a day passes without the food
disappearing, the cow isn't eating and
should be fed by hand.{NextPage_49}
You can make more {13}{25_0_3}{17} by cutting
grass. Get it from the {Location_43_20_23}'s dispenser.{NextPage_49}
(Grazing)
On days when the weather is good, it is
best to let your animals outside.{NextPage_49}
It reduces stress and keeps them healthy.
To move a cow, push them in a direction.
But don't let them out in the rain.{NextPage_49}
If there is grass in the pasture, the cows
eat that, so fodder won't be necessary.{NextPage_49}
(Giving Birth)
If you have cows and bulls, or if you ask
M.P. service, your cow may get pregnant.{NextPage_49}
In about 18 days, the calf will be born.
For about 10 days after the calf is born
it will be in the Calf Hutch.{NextPage_49}
During that time it lives off of milk.{NextPage_49}
(Sickness)
When cows get too stressed or hungry, they
can get sick.{NextPage_49}
When they are sick, use {13}{25_0_5}{17}.
{13}{25_0_5}{17} only works once a day.
It may work in one day, but serious cases{NextPage_49}
may take three or more doses to cure.
If you leave them when they are sick, they
will die, so keep an eye on their health.{NextPage_49}
To keep them healthy, nuzzle your cows,
brush them, and talk to them to see
how they are feeling.{NextPage_49}
(Interaction)
Close contact is necessary for raising
happy cows. Brush and wash them.{NextPage_49}
Your cows will be sure to appreciate it.
Nuzzling them is also a good idea.
But don't wake them when they're sleeping.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can milk female cows for about 40 days
after they give birth. But you can only do
it for a few days before they give birth.{NextPage_49}
To milk a cow, approach its side and milk
it by hand or with a {13}{25_5_6}{17}.
The amount and quality of the milk you{NextPage_49}
get will depend on the cow's condition, so
keep them happy and healthy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can buy:
Normal Cows
Star Cows{NextPage_49}
Brown Cows
Marble Cows
in town.{NextPage_49}
They each give different kinds of milk,
and some are better for processing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
(Food)
Sheep eat {13}{25_0_3}{17}. When the {13}{25_0_3}{17}
in their feedbox disappears, put more in.{NextPage_49}
If half a day passes without the food
disappearing, the sheep isn't eating and
should be fed by hand.{NextPage_49}
You can make more {13}{25_0_3}{17} by cutting
grass. Get it from the {Location_43_20_23}'s dispenser.{NextPage_49}
(Grazing)
On days when the weather is good, it is
best to let your animals outside.{NextPage_49}
It reduces stress and keeps them healthy.
To move a sheep, push them in a direction.
But don't let them out in the rain.{NextPage_49}
If there is grass in the pasture, the
sheep will eat that, so fodder won't
be necessary.{NextPage_49}
(Sickness)
When sheep get too stressed or hungry,
they can get sick.{NextPage_49}
When they are sick, use {13}{25_0_5}{17}.
{13}{25_0_5}{17} only works once a day.
It may work in one day, but serious cases{NextPage_49}
may take three or more doses to cure.
If you leave them when they are sick, they
will die, so keep an eye on their health.{NextPage_49}
To keep them healthy, nuzzle your sheep,
brush them, and talk to them to see
how they are feeling.{NextPage_49}
(Interaction)
Close contact is necessary for raising
happy sheep. Brush and wash them.{NextPage_49}
Your sheep will be sure to appreciate it.
Nuzzling them is also a good idea.
But don't wake them when they're sleeping.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can use {13}{25_5_10}{17} to get {13}{25_0_25}{17} from a
sheep. Once you get {13}{25_0_25}{17} from a sheep, it
takes about 10 days for it to grow back.{NextPage_49}
The quality of the {13}{25_0_25}{17} depends on the
sheep's condition, so try to always keep
an eye on their health and happiness.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
(Food)
Chickens eat {13}{25_0_2}{17}.
When the feed area is empty, add more.{NextPage_49}
I can buy {13}{25_0_2}{17} in the city.
All of the chickens eat out of one
feed area.{NextPage_49}
(Letting them outside)
On days when the weather is good, it is
good to let your chickens outside.{NextPage_49}
When outside, they'll feed themselves and
they are happier and healthier.
But don't let them out in the rain.{NextPage_49}
(Sickness)
When chickens get too stressed or hungry,
they can get sick.{NextPage_49}
When they are sick, use {13}{25_0_5}{17}.
{13}{25_0_5}{17} only works once a day.
It may work in one day, but serious cases{NextPage_49}
may take three or more doses to cure.
If you leave them when they are sick, they
will die, so keep an eye on their health.{NextPage_49}
To keep them healthy, nuzzle your chickens
and talk to them to see
how they are feeling.{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
A healthy female chicken lays about one
{13}{25_0_28}{17} per day.
Also, if you have a rooster,{NextPage_49}
you may get {13}{25_0_30}s{17} as well.
Put a {13}{25_0_30}{17} in the {Location_43_25_23}
and it will hatch.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can buy male and female chickens
in town.{NextPage_0}

(Seeds)
There are many types of crops seeds, and
each must be planted at a particular time{NextPage_49}
of year and in a particular kinds of soil.
If you analyze a seed, you can determine
the best soil and season for it.{NextPage_49}
(Soil)
The soil at this farm gets better the
farther you get from your house.{NextPage_49}
The biggest field is the most fertile.{NextPage_49}
(Seasons)
It's best to plant a seed as soon as
possible in a compatible season.{NextPage_49}
If the seed's season ends before the
harvest, it will wilt.{NextPage_49}
(Caution)
Don't plant seeds next to trees.
They will wilt.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
After you plant a seed, you must water it.
Water again when the soil dries out.
After the harvest, water isn't necessary.{NextPage_49}
Trees don't have to be watered.
Also remember that there is a limit to the
amount of water that will be effective.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Fruits and vegetables can be harvested
a while after the plant's flowers bloom.
Root crops can be harvested{NextPage_49}
when the plant's flowers wilt.
Trees grow tall and produce a large
amount of fruit when in season.{NextPage_49}
When the fruit is ready to pick, you can
shake the tree and then pick up the
fallen fruit from the ground.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
At the moment, the only things you can
ship are {13}Milk{17} and {13}Eggs{17}.
To ship items, look at the {NextPage_49}
{Location_43_5_23} in the {Location_43_24_23} and
move things from your rucksack to the bin
or just put something directly inside.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If there's something you want me to buy in
town, make a note of it on the
Order Form in the {Location_43_24_23}.{NextPage_49}
Remember that buildings will take a while
to build after ordering them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you want to sell something I can't sell
in town, you can put it in your rucksack
and sell it yourself.{NextPage_49}
To open your own shop, go to the empty
lot by the {Location_43_35_23}. People walking
by may buy things from you.{NextPage_0}
