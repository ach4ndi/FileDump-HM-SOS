\u1f41\u1fc3\u1f49\u2136Did you come to hang out?\u2328Diego and Enrique would be\u2328glad, but it's so late.\u232b\u1f41\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Sorry, but I'm about to\u2328wake up Enrique and Diego\u2328so I can talk to them.
\u1f41\u1fc3\u1f4a\u2136Besides, it's late...\u270a...\u270a\u2328And you shouldn't come\u2328in without knocking!\u232b\u1f41\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Can you just go home?\u2328
\u1f41\u1fc3\u1f48\u2136Where are you going?\u232bYou have to go out the\u2328front door, not the\u2328back door.
