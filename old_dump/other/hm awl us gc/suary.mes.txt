Ah, how are you? {32_3_232}
You've come at just
the right time. {NextPage_49}
If you don't mind,
would you accept
these clippers as a{NextPage_1}gift from me?
{CharName_13} no longer
needs them now that{NextPage_1}he's all handsome.
Still, I'm sure you{NextPage_1}could get some use
out of them. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please take care of
them.
Off you go then. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
An adequate amount
of time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, you're
quite fast. {NextPage_49}
Your footwork is
also quite good. {NextPage_49}
At this rate you'll
be able to compete
with {CharName_13}. {NextPage_49}
Keep up your
training son. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Actually we were
just talking about
a 3-man race. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We'd like you to
be the starter. {32_7_208}{NextPage_49}
Sorry to drop this
on you so suddenly. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He...pant pant...{32_3_232}
trains everyday...{32_3_232}
But {CharName_13}...{32_3_232}
You might be able to{32_3_232}
...pant pant...keep
up with him...{32_3_232}
Whew...he's really
something...{32_3_232}
I'm too...pant pant
...old now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No...pant pant...
really. {32_3_232}
I'll be your coach...{32_3_232}
Why don't you train
to be a athlete like
{CharName_13}?{32_3_232}
We've got to prepare
for a new...race... {32_3_232}
If you train...you
could easily take
a medal... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I kind of like
{29_0}.
How much is it?
{41_3_2}{2a_1_5}G is enough.
{2a_2_5}G.
That's not for sale.
----------x----------
{50_11_0_10}Really!?
{50_11_0_0}That's quite
a deal. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, thank you... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a little much...
Well, that's fine
by me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, guess that's
it then. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd love {29_0}.
How much?
{41_3_2}{2a_1_5}G is enough.
{2a_2_5} G.
That's not for sale.
----------x----------
{34_1_67}Are you well,
my friend? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_67}Good morning, my
friend! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_67}How are you feeling
today? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing
here in the middle
of the night? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, take it easy.
Just don't touch
the machines okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's my favorite
dish.
Is it for me? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_11_0_10}Thanks a bunch my
friend. {50_11_0_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_11_0_4}Then, don't be
putting it in my
face. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, that does look
good!
Can I have it? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
Such a delicious
looking thing you've
got there. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got something
good to eat there. {NextPage_1}Would you give it
to me?
{41_2_1}Give it.
Don't give it.
----------x----------
{50_11_0_10}Thank you, my friend.
{50_11_0_0}I'll treasure it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_11_0_2}Why you...
That's so cheap. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's great.
So you'll give it
to me then?
{41_2_1}Sure.
No way.
----------x----------
{50_11_0_9}Blarrgh.
Get that out of
here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute boy.
He looks a lot like
Celia... {NextPage_49}
I'll train him
when he gets bigger.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Go running with
Grandpa, eh...? {NextPage_49}
Hmm, not quite yet,
he needs more time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He's so cute.
He looks just like
Muffy... {NextPage_49}
I'll train him
when he gets bigger. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He's so cute.
He looks just like
Nami... {NextPage_49}
I'll train him
when he gets bigger. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute little
dog you have. {NextPage_49}
Hey buddy, do you
want to race me? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cute little doggie. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not really a
cat person. {NextPage_49}
But I wonder who's
faster, me or
the cat...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cute little chicky.
Come to me little
guy... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Here chicky chicky. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't need any
more chickens, but
I'll take some {NextPage_1}eggs if it lays
any. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ducks run too
slow. {NextPage_49}
They're no match
for me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not too
knowledgeable
on plants. {NextPage_49}
What kind of seed
is that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Crops from your
farm? {NextPage_49}
I'll have some if
they're fresh.
May I? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
Can I have that? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
Fresh vegetables are
good for the body. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that wild plant
good for the body...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You cooked that
dish? Looks pretty
good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, you can cook?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's good looking
food, but how many
calories are in it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know much
about agriculture
and the like, but {NextPage_1}I know that's
a hoe. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you want me
to do with it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know much
about agriculture
and the like, but {NextPage_1}I know that's
a sickle. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you want me
to do with it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't have a field
so I have no use for
something like that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are the
clippers I gave you.
Do you like them? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_11_0_10}That's good to
hear.{50_11_0_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_11_0_9}...I see... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've got some fond
memories of them. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't make your
body stronger if
you use tools. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not too wise
about tools and
such. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those grow all over
my running track... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh!
Do you throw discus?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's too light
to throw it well...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of
ingredient is
that? {NextPage_49}
I wonder if it's
healthy for you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's...
Is that my
gold medal? {NextPage_49}
Take care of it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That medal is the
result of blood,
sweat, and tears. {NextPage_49}
Don't you ever
sell it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looking at it makes
me remember the
old days... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love the wide open
space of this
valley.{NextPage_49}
No worries about
elbow room... {NextPage_49}
I'm sure it'd be
more convenient to
live in the city, {NextPage_49}
but I love running
in such open green
fields. {NextPage_49}
That's why I
moved out here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Once, I was a great
athlete, but I had
injured my leg in {NextPage_1}the middle of a
race. {NextPage_49}
That's why I became
a race director. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That do you think of
Hugh? He's got some
kind of genius. {NextPage_49}
I want to show Hugh
the true ability
he has within. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've heard how
{29_0} of
Mineral Town had{NextPage_1}walked over a total
of 1,000,000 steps. {NextPage_49}
I've run over
1,000,000 paces
myself. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I loved that stuff
I got before.
It was delicious. {NextPage_49}
Hope I can get
it again sometime. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That {29_0} was
terrific! {NextPage_49}
It's gotta be good
for the body.
I mean it... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk I got
before really made
my body feel good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That fish you gave
me last time tasted
okay. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That wild grass you
gave me last time
tasted okay. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That food...
The taste was...
I can't place it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your farm has become
something else. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Raising crops seems
to take a lot but
you're doing well. {NextPage_49}
You've got quite a
physique now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you like running?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
I can tell...
You look pretty
fast. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That can't be.
I see you running
around here often. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Make sure you take
crucial breaks
when you get {NextPage_1}tried from all
the running. {NextPage_49}
Otherwise you won't
burn up enough
calories. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everyday I go
running with my son. {NextPage_49}
Your welcome to
join us. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Running is good for
the body. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Beautiful, shining
sweat is the true
symbol of a man. {NextPage_49}
{50_11_0_10}{34_1_66}Ha ha ha!{50_11_0_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Seems my speed has
dropped a bit.{NextPage_49}
Must be getting
on in years. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's strange really.
I feel like the
weights on my {NextPage_1}machines are
vanishing... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if someone
is stealing my
weights... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How can I train if
I don't have weights?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes a place
like this is nice. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't feel so
good... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you exercising? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's important
to train everyday. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Running is great in
the Spring. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's good for the
body to exercise
and sweat. {NextPage_49}
Ah, such a great
feeling it is. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a little too
hot for running
this season. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love running
through the forest.{NextPage_49}
The leaves change to
such beautiful
colors in the Fall. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you run in the
Winter, your body
will warm up. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Here the snow falls
heavily. It's not
even fun to run. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm training right
now. Talk to me
later okay? Whew... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't talk when
I'm running...
...pant pant...{NextPage_49}
It disrupts my
breathing...
patterns... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_11_0_4}Don't talk to me...
I'm training right
now...pant pant... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This old man may be
stubborn at times,
but my wife thinks {NextPage_1}that I'm a good
person anyway. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't you think
this room is
peaceful..? {NextPage_49}
It's almost like
your spirit is
relaxing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Even when you train
it's important
to have a place {NextPage_1}where you can
go and relax. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
To be a top athlete
you always need to
think of what the {NextPage_1}next step is going
to be. {NextPage_49}
That's why
observation is
important. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's lucky for an
athlete to have a
doctor live nearby.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It'd be good if
you'd come and
observe me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is {CharName_1} well?{NextPage_49}
{50_11_0_9}My Hugh hasn't been
listening to me much
lately. {NextPage_49}
Must be adolescent
rebelliousness... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He's always listened
to me before but
he's now and then {NextPage_1}he skips out
on his training. {NextPage_49}
{50_11_0_9}I wonder why... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Raising children is
no easy task. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, I actually
have something I'd
like you to take. {NextPage_49}
It's a medal I won
back when used to
race. {NextPage_49}
You might think it's
a weird request
of me , but please. {NextPage_1}I need to let that
memory go... {NextPage_1}Please... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you.
But not today. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0},
how are you doing?{NextPage_49}
Leave {CharName_1}
to me. I won't be
able to replace you,{NextPage_49}
but I'll do my best
to train him.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}.
A song! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to hit
the sack soon so...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time for bed
so please go home. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I need to be on
my way so... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really have to
leave now...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So long my friend. {NextPage_0}
