\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136The air is so clear\u2328and pure around this\u2328spring.\u232bThe chirp of crickets, the\u2328song of birds... Listen\u2328to nature's symphony.
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f49\u2136This would be a wonderful\u2328spot for some violin music,\u2328don't you think?
\u2332 Would you please play?\u2328 You don't have to play.
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f49\u2136I wouldn't deny the request\u2328of a lovely lady like\u2328yourself.
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f49\u2136Ah, the air has a unique\u2328quality here. It gives my\u2328violin a richer sound.\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Did you enjoy hearing\u2328me play?
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f49\u2136Wonderful. I hoped you\u2328would.\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Anyway, the hour is growing\u2328late. Perhaps we should\u2328call it a day.\u232bI quite enjoyed spending\u2328time with you, though. We\u2328should do this again soon.
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f4b\u2136So you don't want to hear\u2328me play? Is that what you're\u2328saying?\u232bThat...saddens me deeply.\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f4c\u2136Have you no appreciation\u2328for music at all?\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f4b\u2136Well, I should go.\u232bPerhaps someday you'll be\u2328able to understand my music.
