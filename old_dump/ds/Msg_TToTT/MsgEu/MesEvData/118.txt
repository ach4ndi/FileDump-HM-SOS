\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136The Harvest Goddess made\u2328the storm yesterday to show\u2328us that she was angry.\u232bI wonder why?\u2328Oh, Harvest Goddess...
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136You're working again today?
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136You're working again today?
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136You're working again today?
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136How adorable.\u2328And so soft!\u2328Hee hee! It seems so happy.
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136Oh, Harvest Goddess,\u2328please forgive me\u2328for being so mean.\u232bI had unkind thoughts\u2328about this poor animal.

\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136So that's a blue feather...\u2328It joins couples in\u2328happiness.\u232bWhoever you give it to, I\u2328wish you the best of luck.
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136Oh, I couldn't accept that.\u2328I wouldn't feel right about\u2328it.
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136I couldn't accept another\u2328gift today. Greed corrupts\u2328the heart.
\u1f40\u1fb8\u1f49\u2135Oh, today's Harmony Day!\u2328Thank you, \u232a.
\u1f40\u1fb8\u1f49\u2135Thank you, \u232a.\u2328\u232b\u1f40\u1fb8\u1f48\u2135Make sure you give one to\u2328your wife, too!
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136I'm sorry, but\u2328I can't accept this.
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f4d\u2136Oh, \u232a, you remembered\u2328that today is my birthday!\u232bAnd you're giving me\u2328\u206dice cream\u206c? You're \u2328so sweet! Thank you!♪

\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136You're working again today?
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136You're working again today?
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136Oh, thank you so much!\u2328\u2328\u232b\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f4d\u2136This is a wonderful birthday\u2328present!\u2328\u232b\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136Oh, Harvest Goddess, I'm\u2328so happy right now. 
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136I'm quite impressed\u2328that you know what I like!\u2328Thank you.\u232bOh, I must thank\u2328the Harvest Goddess as well.

\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136Thank you. I accept your\u2328gift with gratitude.
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136Today's my birthday, but\u2328you've given me something\u2328that makes me sad.\u232bHarvest Goddess, is this\u2328some sort of test? If it is,\u2328I suppose I can bear it.
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136Oh what should I do?\u2328Harvest Goddess, is this\u2328terrible gift a test?
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136What a cruel gift, \u232a!\u2328This is too much to bear!
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136You're working again today?
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136You're working again today?

\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136The Harvest Goddess made\u2328this storm to show her\u2328anger.\u232bI hope she calms down soon.
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136The Goddess brings this snow\u2328to show her anger.\u2328I hope she calms down soon.

\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136It makes me so happy to see\u2328you in church so often.\u232bI'm glad you share my love\u2328for the Harvest Goddess.
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136I lost my parents when I\u2328was young. The church took\u2328me in after that.\u232bEver since then, the church\u2328has been my family.
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136Nathan knows just how to\u2328explain the teaching of our\u2328Harvest Goddess.\u232bI really look up to him.
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136I'm still in training.\u2328Even cleaning up is part\u2328of my training.\u232bI've got to do a good job.
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136I help share the teachings\u2328of our Harvest Goddess with\u2328the people of this village.\u232b\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f49\u2136I just want everyone to be\u2328happy. Now let's give thanks\u2328together.
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136You're working again today?
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f4a\u2136\u232a, you're so mean!\u2328I'm telling the Harvest\u2328Goddess!
\u2332 I'm sorry.\u2328 I have nothing to say.
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136It's okay. As long as you\u2328understand, the Harvest\u2328Goddess will forgive you.
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f4a\u2136Is that so? That's a pity.\u2328Then I wash my hands of you!
\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f48\u2136You're working again today?

\u1f46\u1fb8\u1f4b\u2136I may have romanticized\u2328marriage a little.\u232bIt's not quite how I thought\u2328it would be.
