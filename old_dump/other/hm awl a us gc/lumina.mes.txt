Excuse me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pardon me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you don't have anything?
Never mind then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you don't have anything to sell,
I'll have to come back later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I'm just looking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess there's nothing that I want here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like the {29_0},
but how much is it..?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}My, that's a bargain.
Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh... Never mind then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello, {CharName_0}.
How are you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}I'm bored today...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}How boring...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Good morning!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Oh, hello, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, hello {CharName_0}.
What are you doing out at this hour?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, hello {CharName_0}.
What are you doing out at this hour?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Thank you for coming.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Oh, I love that kind of thing.
Could I have it?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}{34_1_60}Yippee! Thank you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}Oh... How boring...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Ooh, that's nice.
Can I have it?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}I love that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}Eww, that looks gross.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}I hate that kind of thing.
Are you trying to taunt me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}Yuck! What is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where did you get something like that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}How cute.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Yes, you're a cutie!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}What a cute doggie.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My auntie likes kitties, but I
love doggies myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute little doggie.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You shouldn't carry cats
around like that, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cats are so mysterious.
The cats at our house are pretty
cute and lovable, don't you think?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}I don't like chickens.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't like chickens, but I
don't mind baby chicks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}I told you I don't like them!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, you have ducks, too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do ducks lay eggs too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Some kind of seed?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you grow that on your farm?
Growing things must be fun...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are lots of kinds of crops, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't like milk very much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sebastian always tells me that milk
is good for me and makes me drink it.
But afterward my stomach gets upset.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that cheese on your farm?
It looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Oh, is it for me?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
That cheese looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cheese is good for you, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that butter on your farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet Sebastian would like to
have that...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Butter. Butter... Butter?
It's kind of a strange word
if you listen to it being uttered.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, an egg.
Is it for me?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
If you kept that egg warm, do
you think it would hatch?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is there something special about that egg?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you always walk around
carrying things like that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Raw fish is all slimy and
yucky.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a wild plant from around here.
I guess Sebastian sometimes uses those
in his cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you like those, {CharName_0}?
I don't like them very much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a wild plant from around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that, {CharName_0}?
{50_9_0_10}Wow, it looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you like to cook,
huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a weird hoe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know anything about tools.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a worn hoe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a hoe, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a strange sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You shouldn't wave that thing around.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a sickle, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is something special about that sickle?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Say, isn't that the watering can
that we used to have around the house?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did my auntie give that to you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a strange watering can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That's a watering can, right?
When I was younger, I used to water
the trees in the garden with one of those.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}{34_1_60}If you fill that up with water and spin
around, it can be pretty fun. Heehee!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you like watering cans or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an odd machine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what that's used for?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
............{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those flowers grow all around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a pretty flower.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that, anyway?
A seasoning?
What does it taste like?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If it's a seasoning, I bet Sebastian
would know something about it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what kind of seasoning it is?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}That's a strange sound.
But I like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what that medal is for?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an unusual necklace.
It's very pretty though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you find out what kind of
music that was?
I suppose not.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I wonder what kind of song it is?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's the sheet music I gave you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Could that be a... firecracker?
Cool! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did Kassey make that?
Or maybe Patrick...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet that'd be pretty if you set it off.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That sure is a big firecracker.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}What is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Auntie Romana is actually my
grandmother. But she likes me to
call her “Auntie” here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I often practice my piano when
I'm at home.
You can hear it from outside, I think.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My mother and father both
died in an accident when I was
still very young.{NextPage_49}
I'm sorry for bringing this up so
suddenly...{NextPage_49}
But it feels better to tell you
about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the person running the
farm in Mineral Town is
really rich...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the person running the
farm in Mineral Town is
really popular...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that someone has grown every crop
there is. In Mineral Town, I think...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you ever been to Mineral Town?
The person who runs the farm there
is really kind to her animals, I hear.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the person running the
farm in Mineral Town really likes
digging holes...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that somebody in Mineral Town
caught every kind of fish there is.
I wonder if she caught the fish here too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Walking one million step is amazing.{NextPage_1}But does it really accomplish
anything...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farm in Mineral Town
has been going for 50 years...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard there's a master angler
in Mineral Town.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the person running the
farm in Mineral Town has
really bad taste.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard somebody in Mineral Town has
three cottages.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know, I heard that they have
something called “Mythic Tools”
in Mineral Town.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That thing you gave me
was really delicious.
I'd love some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me
tasted all right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}The {29_0} you gave me
was pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}The {29_0} you gave me
was the best!{NextPage_1}Really!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me seemed...
really nutritious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me tasted
sort of weak.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That milk you gave me
was good. But it still upsets my tummy.
Do you think I'm lactose intolerant?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That milk you gave me was really
good. But it still upsets my tummy.
Do you think I'm lactose intolerant?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me tasted
good, but...
It seemed a little weak.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That milk that you gave me was the
best I've ever tasted.
But my tummy still doesn't like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me tasted
good, but...
It seemed a little too strong.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That milk you gave me
tasted just great.
But maybe it's a little strong for me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That cheese you gave me
was really good.
I'd love some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave me was
reaaally sour tasting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That cheese you made
was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That butter you gave me
was really good on bread.
I'd love some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter you gave me was
reaaally strong tasting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That cheese you made
was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}The {29_0} you made
was reaaally good.
Please make it again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}I thought that food you gave me
was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That wild plant you gave
me was one of my favorites.
It was really good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}I thought the wild plant you
gave me was good, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I ate that thing that you
gave me, but I can't remember
what it tasted like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that you're really working
hard on your farm.{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_10}Everybody says that you're
a real farmer now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}I heard that you're really
good at growing things.
Auntie was impressed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everybody says that the food you
cook is the best.{NextPage_49}
But I wonder if you're a better cook
than Sebastian...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that you've been working
really hard on your farm.
Everybody is impressed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that you're pretty good
at growing things.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everybody thinks that your
cooking is great.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, everybody's been
saying how you've gotten used
to farm life.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that you're doing your
best to raise your crops.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that you've been doing a
lot of cooking. It must be difficult.
to farm and cook at the same time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did Auntie tell you about this?{NextPage_49}
She took me in when I was young.
{50_9_0_9}My parents died, and...{NextPage_49}
And so I came to live with my
Auntie Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Apparently Kate is writing a book
about my Auntie Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Auntie Romana has a very interesting
life, so I think she'd make a great
subject for a book.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder how Kate is going to
portray Auntie Romana as...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That Kate is a gifted writer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Auntie Romana is a very good person.
She can sometimes be a little strict, but
she's also cheerful and fun.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just love living here.
Auntie Romana and Sebastian are so nice.
But I do get lonely sometimes.{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_9}After all, I don't really have any
friends, and Mom and Dad are... Well,
there's no point dwelling on that...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't tell Auntie Romana that
I'm lonely, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what my kind of person
my father was...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's kind of nice to come to a place
like this once in a while.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My Auntie says I shouldn't come here.
But that's not right, is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}I like it here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Forget-Me-Not Valley is a nice place
to live. The people are so interesting...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Auntie Romana gets angry
if I call her “Grandma.”{34_1_60}
So don't tell anybody, all right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's nothing very interesting in
my room, hmm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}At this time of year I feel like
going outside.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Is farm work fun?
It looks kind of interesting...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Sometimes when I'm just passing
time here, I come across the most
interesting animals.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes a big lizard appears near the
forest, but it's got a bandage on one of
its front legs. Who could have done that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I see beautiful scenery I feel
like painting a picture of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes a big turtle appears near
the swamp. There's red scarf wrapped
around it. Who could have done that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}The air feels nice and crisp, doesn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what would happen if the
snow accumulated?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you come to listen to me
play the piano?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I'm sorry.
I don't feel like playing right now...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Oh, that's good. Because...
{50_9_0_9}I don't feel like playing right now...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I like playing the piano, but my
practice pieces aren't very interesting.
I don't like them.{NextPage_49}
But if I don't practice, I'll never
get good enough to play the
songs that I really like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think I've improved at the piano
recently. Come and hear me again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've got to practice more...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want to get good at the piano...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want to be even better at the piano...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I should really help cleaning up
sometimes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sebastian is getting older now, so
I need to do my part...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just because I'm in the kitchen,
I won't snack on things like Auntie
Romana does.{NextPage_49}
I want to grow in the right direction.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cleaning up after a meal can be
a lot of work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_25}Oh, I almost forgot.
Do you know a lot about music,
{CharName_0}?{NextPage_49}
Would you like this sheet music?
I can't play it on the piano. In fact,
I can't make heads or tails of it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you.
But I can't right now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You always seem so busy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The sound of raindrops is pretty
nice, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just don't enjoy playing the piano
lately. Auntie Romana is so...{NextPage_49}
I just don't know what it means to
“play more freely.”
{41_2_0}Just work harder.
Just have more fun.
----------x----------
I don't know how to work
any harder than I already am!
That's impossible!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}So we can play it, and sing songs...{32_1_144}
That's why.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Of course!{32_1_144}
You know, I feel like I've just
remembered something very important.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Could I talk to you for a minute...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I started playing piano when I was three.
Auntie Romana taught me.{NextPage_49}
Whenever I played without making any
mistakes, she would praise me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But it turned into a kind of pressure for
me. The more was expected of me...{NextPage_49}
And every time I was told how good a
player my mother was... I felt worse.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
After a while I got so scared
of making mistakes...{NextPage_49}
I was so afraid that I would
disappoint Auntie Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I was trying to live up to
my mother's memory.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But Auntie Romana never wanted
that to happen.{NextPage_49}
That's why she tells me that I
should play more freely.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel so much better now.
I think I'll be able to enjoy playing
the piano now.{NextPage_49}
Thank you, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Auntie Romana! I was listening to that!
You know very well that I painted that!
What was that about Ronet's apprentice?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You said “she liked Ronet.” But I still
like her. I'm still alive, you know!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Poor Van.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, did you see that?
Isn't that terrible?{NextPage_49}
.........................{NextPage_49}
Do you think I might actually
have talent as a painter?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, I thought of you
like an older sister...{NextPage_49}
I shouldn't cry so much, I know.{32_5_220}
I'm going to continue playing my piano.
I hope you'll be watching over me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, could you please
sing a song for our friend
{CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to be going to bed soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time for me to go to bed.
Could you come back tomorrow?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to be leaving soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time for me to go out.
If you'll excuse me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Goodbye...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Umm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...I need to ask you something.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {32_1_44}{CharName_0},
have you been there all this time?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
........................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, {32_1_244}do you like art?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll paint your portrait sometime.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hee hee. {32_1_244}Well, I must be going.
Please make yourself at home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder where Sebastian could
have gone looking for another
paintbrush...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh! {32_1_244}Sebastian.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you mind?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All right then, {CharName_0}.
See you later!♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello, Rock.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_7}A toupee! I can't believe it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got to be kidding me!{NextPage_49}
Not bald!
Not you, Rock!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{13}..............?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_7}{CharName_0}...{NextPage_49}
Sebastian doesn't wear a toupee, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This has nothing to do with you, Rock!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}No!!{NextPage_49}
{32_1_44}{50_9_0_0}I was thinking about my parents.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't remember my parents at all.
I wonder what kind of people they were.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_0}But even if I ask Auntie Romana,{NextPage_1}she never gives me a straight answer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_0}Maybe Auntie Romana's told
Sebastian not to say anything?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_7}He won't tell me anything...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_7}If I could do that, there'd be no problem!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Rock...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_26}Now?
I was about to go to the Forest.{NextPage_49}
Would you like to come with me, Rock?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But I wanted to go to the forest today...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}Rock, you're not listening to me at all!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_0}{50_9_0_4}So why did we come to the sea today?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
....................{32_1_244}I don't hear anything.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Hmph!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Rock, you're just like a little kid.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But...{NextPage_1}You and I are both kind of selfish.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_25}No one's ever said that to me before.{32_1_244}
Thank you, Rock.{50_9_0_3}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sebastian...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's nothing.{NextPage_0}
