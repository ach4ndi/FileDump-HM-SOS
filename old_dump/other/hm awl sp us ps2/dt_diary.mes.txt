I'll never be a good spy if
I can't protect my treasures
from the bad guys.{NextPage_1}I'll do my best!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad looked really tired today.
I tried to be helpful by running a
bath for him...that is when I realized{NextPage_1}that he is not as young as I always
thought he was. I should start doing
more to help him out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have a new friend in my room.
It's a huuuge teddy bear!{NextPage_49}
But I think that bear must be
a spy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad bought me a stuffed animal.
I think I'm way too old to get excited
over some dumb stuffed animal...{NextPage_1}But something's fishy about this one.
There's this zipper on its back...I
keep thinking someone's gonna jump out.{NextPage_1}It's kinda scary, but it's
kinda exciting, too...{u_805a}{NextPage_0}

----------x----------
{CharName_13} is a really fast runner.
He's awesome!
I wish I could run as fast as{NextPage_1}{CharName_13} can...
Boys are so lucky.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lately I've become interested
in all kinds of sports.
Athletes sure are cool.{NextPage_1}I sure wish my dad were an
athlete...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I tried jumping at tree branches today.
I think I might have touched one.
If I practice, I bet I'll be able{NextPage_1}to jump high enough to touch
that branch for sure.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lately I've been thinking that girls
really should try working out.
After all, they say having a little{NextPage_1}muscle on you is stylish and hip!
I'll give it a shot!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think boys who are good
at sports are really cool.{NextPage_49}
Wouldn't it be nice to go running
together on a beach at sunset...{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What brand of running shoes
does {CharName_13} wear, I wonder?
It's really been bugging me lately.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lately I've realized that my clothes
aren't really made for exercising.
My heavy shoes are a real bother.{NextPage_1}I wonder if they'll end up actually
being better for my training.
Hmm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Meals are important when you're
training! You won't get any muscles
if you don't eat a lot of protein.{NextPage_1}I wonder what kind of meals
{CharName_13}'s been eating.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Animal movements apply in sports, too.
Especially the way a cat moves...
Flexibility is key.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are so many people here
who have musical instruments.
I want one, too.{NextPage_1}Mom will get mad if I keep asking
for one, so I guess I'll try to
be patient instead.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_20} is so cool!
He's such a good guitar player.
I think it would be great if he{NextPage_1}could play a song just for me.
One day I'd like a husband who
can play an instrument, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_7} said that Dad's dad
was completely tone deaf.
Maybe Dad is, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Instruments are cool!
They help you express feelings that
are so hard to express otherwise.{NextPage_1}But if you express too many of your
feelings, people might not want to
listen to you anymore...{NextPage_1}How embarrassing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want to hear some really intense music.
Dad's records aren't enough for me.
I hope {CharName_36} brings me something better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Music can be healing.
Actually, listening to music makes
me feel really calm and relaxed...{NextPage_1}Interesting...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think a life with music is much
more fun than one without music.{NextPage_49}
But I've never lived a life without
music, so I guess I can't be sure.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's pretty fun to find out what
kind of music people listen to.
I understand how {CharName_14} can listen to{NextPage_1}classical music, but I can't imagine
him listening to pop tunes at all.
Everyone has a style of music that{NextPage_1}suits them best...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's hard to describe sounds in words.
To begin with, I can't tell how others
hear the same sounds I'm hearing.{NextPage_1}I feel like putting on someone else's
ears for a change. Wouldn't it be cool
to visit a whole new world of sounds?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My scribble pad has lots of pictures
that I drew when I was little.
But I can't tell what they are!{NextPage_1}Mom says they're really nostalgic.
What does ♪nostalgic♪ mean?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today I drew a picture of the ocean.
It was just a quick sketch, and when
I looked at the ocean again, I noticed{NextPage_1}that it was an entirely different color.
How strange...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_21} is always sitting by
the rocks, thinking about something.
I thought that was very weird.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is this ♪self-expression♪ thing?
Is it drawing pictures?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lately I prefer dark colors.
Black, silver...
They're both so cool.{NextPage_1}Am I sick?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why are the lines of people's bodies--
especially women's--so beautiful?
ÄMine aren't, though.Ö{NextPage_1}I wonder if anyone will be my model.
Maybe Flora will...
Now that I think about it, that woman{NextPage_1}in Takakura's photo sure is beautiful.
Maybe she'd model for me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's the theme of {CharName_21}'s artwork?
There must be some reason he puts
so much time and effort into it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can't the things our minds produce
be called ♪natural♪?
They may be ♪artificial♪ or ♪manmade♪,{NextPage_1}but I don't think the opposite of that is
♪natural♪. Aren't humans part of nature?
It makes my head hurt so much.{NextPage_1}I think that's enough for today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's the definition of an ♪artist♪?
If you think you're an artist, are you?
And furthermore, what is ♪art♪?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_8}'s kitty can't go outside
by itself.
Poor kitty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think it would be fun if
I had lots and lots of animals
on my farm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I saw a turtle in the swamp today.
I was surprised by how big it was.
It was really huge, but it somehow{NextPage_1}manages to stay out of sight.
Not bad for a turtle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think {CharName_8}'s cat must
be smarter than I am.
What a blow to my ego!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I saw an owl in the forest.
Birds of prey are so awesome!
I just love how dignified they are.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do city boys think about a girl
who grew up on a farm?
I bet they'd think she's really pure.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do I have a likeable face?
I mean, would animals like me?
That just might be important{NextPage_1}when you work on a farm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If I were an animal, would I be
a dog or a cat?
Maybe a cat... no, a dog.{NextPage_1}And Dad is definitely a dog ÄsomehowÖ.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I saw my first lizard in a long time.
They look so much like dinosaurs.
Is that because it's evolved so much,{NextPage_1}or because it's hardly evolved at all?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_29}'s fields have
so many different smells.
And sometimes they really stink!{NextPage_1}Can you grow stuff even if your
fields don't have that smell?
Maybe you need it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I saw some really pretty flowers.
When I picked them, these three
tiny little guys came out and{NextPage_1}got really mad at me.
They don't need to be so stingy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today I found a leaf that had a neat
shape. But there was a bug on it,
so I threw it away.{NextPage_1}I hate bugs.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nice-smelling flowers attract lots of
bugs. If I were that flower, would I
attract lots of boys? ÄYikes!Ö{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes I think that girls admire
flowers because they see themselves
in them.{NextPage_1}I sure wish I could be a flower girl.
ÄOr is that something different?Ö{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Does {CharName_30} do any farmwork?
I can't say I've seen him do much...
How terrible that {CharName_29} has to work{NextPage_1}that huge farm all by herself.
{CharName_29} can only do so much,
after all. Who can't use help?{NextPage_1}I couldn't do it alone...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are all sorts of new technologies
making their way into the market.
I sure would like to see some.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Growing the most delicious crops
requires hard work and effort. That's
all there is to it.{NextPage_1}Isn't there an easier way?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What if we could speed up
crop growth by 2111 percent?
Or maybe that would take{NextPage_1}all the fun out of farming.
I wonder.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_19}'s roof is always making
this kind of crackling noise.
Even on rainy days.{NextPage_1}{CharName_19} just keeps doing his
experiments every day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like studying.
But {CharName_16} said she hates it.
I thought that was weird.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I made a big discovery today.
Mom changes her voice depending
on who she's talking to.{NextPage_1}She has a higher voice when she's
talking with other people than when
she's talking to Dad. Why?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lately I've been so obsessed about
the most ordinary things. Why... how...
since when...{NextPage_1}Wish I could answer all those questions,
but my head is still full of puzzles.
I've got to study more...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks like {CharName_19}'s growing something
funny in his flowerbed.
I'll have to ask about it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's neat to think about cooking
from a scientific point of view.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Even grownups still have a lot to
learn. Once you get your feet wet,
you get pulled in deeper and deeper.{NextPage_1}Understand 2 thing, and you'll have
21 questions. That must be how we
build up knowledge, huh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's so fun solving things!{u_805a}
Now I know why {CharName_19} gets so
absorbed in his work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't have enough books.
I've read all the ones at home...{NextPage_49}
I want to read so many more.
There must be tons in the city.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad is always so busy.
But I like him a lot because he's
real nice to me.{NextPage_1}I hope I can marry someone like
Dad one day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad has such kind eyes
when he looks at animals.
He does when he looks at me,{NextPage_1}too, but with animals, it's a little
different.
Those animals can be so annoying.{NextPage_1}I told Mom about my feelings.
She said, ♪Are you jealous?♪
What does ♪jealous♪ mean?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad is always so busy.
But I like him a lot because he's
real nice to me.{NextPage_1}I hope I can marry someone like
Dad one day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Which does Dad like more, me or the farm?
The farm. I'm sure of it.
All he thinks about is work!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I may not ever take over the farm,
but if I did, would I be able to run
it as well as Dad does?{NextPage_1}I bet it would be too hard for me
to handle. No way could I ever do
half the stuff Dad does around here...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Doesn't Mom ever want to help Dad?
Hmmm...
Maybe I can lend him a hand.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lately I've come to realize just
how cool my dad really is.
I was born and raised here, so I{NextPage_1}can probably slip right into farm work.
Then again, Dad left everything
behind to start this farm here.{NextPage_1}I'll probably never know the
hardships he endured.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is Dad thinking about leaving me
the farm? Probably not.
But I don't have any brothers.{NextPage_1}Hmmm...I wonder.{NextPage_0}

----------x----------
What does Dad think about
{CharName_29}'s farm, I wonder?
They must be rivals, after all...{NextPage_1}How awful.
Grownups are always so hypocritical.
ÄDoes that make me a hypocrite, too?Ö{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe Dad should focus more on
raising animals than growing crops.
We're more of a ranch, after all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes I think Dad isn't
cut out for farm work...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad's become a real pro at using that
hoe, but he's no spring chicken.
If he's not careful, he could end up{NextPage_1}really hurting himself.
Mom must be worried about him, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet we could live off the
crops we grow here.
ÄWe'd put ourselves out of business!Ö{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

These days, men have to know how to cook.
I guess Dad passes that test!{u_805a}
ÄYou're great, Dad! ❤Ö{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad's cooking is so delicious!
I think it's even better than Mom's.
ÄSorry, Mom.Ö{NextPage_1}I bet he could open a restaurant.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

I think it's even better than Mom's.
ÄSorry, Mom.Ö{NextPage_1}I bet he could open a restaurant.{NextPage_0}

I watched Dad cook and decided
to try it myself. What a mistake!
I'll never be a good cook at this rate.{NextPage_1}Practice, practice, practice!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think Dad is so cool. He can even
cook fish dishes that turn out great.
I wouldn't know where to start!{NextPage_1}ÄI'm just not a good cook, period.
Fish has nothing to do with it.Ö{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I watched Dad cook and decided
to try it myself. What a mistake!

I think Dad must be rich.
{CharName_36} said so, too.
But I always wear the same clothes.{NextPage_1}I wish he'd buy me a new outfit,
at least.{NextPage_0}

Dad's very good at saving money.
Either that, or he's a real tightwad.
I guess that's not such a bad quality{NextPage_1}in a husband.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes I look at Dad and wonder
if money is really that important
out here in the sticks.{NextPage_1}I guess we need money to
expand {24_2}Farm, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad's very good at saving money.
Either that, or he's a real tightwad.
I guess that's not such a bad quality{NextPage_1}in a husband.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know, if Dad's saving up all
that money, he ought to use some
of it to take Mom on a nice trip{NextPage_1}somewhere.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Listen, Dad, you can't take that
money with you when you're gone!
Oh, if only I could tell him!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think we have just enough to
get by out here in the country...
ÄOr maybe I'm being naive.Ö{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom doesn't usually talk much.

I wish she would talk more.{NextPage_1}That would be nice.{NextPage_0}

Why did Mom want to marry Dad?
After all, she doesn't seem like
the marrying type. Weird.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom's skin is still so nice and firm!
I hope mine's like that at her age...
Actually, it feels like none of the{NextPage_1}women here age very much.
Is it the fresh air and water?
ÄI'm in luck!{u_805a}Ö{NextPage_0}

I've always thought my mom was

She could at least study with me.{NextPage_0}

Mom's not really much for cooking.
She just doesn't have the knack.
Ack, what if I inherited that?!{NextPage_1}I'll never be a good cook...!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom still has her old figure, and at
her age, too! Her tummy's flat and
her curves are just right.{NextPage_1}I've got to find out her secret!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom is a makeup pro!
Her face is still pretty even without
any, though Äfor someone her ageÖ.{NextPage_1}With makeup, she looks 21 years younger.
I'd better have her teach me her
techniques soon!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now that I'm all grown up, I get the
feeling that {CharName_27} liked Mom once
upon a time.{NextPage_49}
But their ages are so far apart, and
I don't think Mom was ever really
interested in {CharName_27} in that way...{NextPage_49}
Call it women's intuition, but
something sure is fishy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom always tells me I'm a real
beauty, so I started feeling all full
of myself and took a good look{NextPage_1}in the bathroom mirror.
You know what? I don't look much
like Mom after all.{NextPage_1}But wait a minute--
Dad's plenty handsome!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom manages to stay cute
even as she gets older.
I thought she was so charming when{NextPage_1}she lost her hankie the other day.
A woman is lovable no matter her age!
I'm writing that one down.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The grownups say Mom shouldn't
go to the Blue Bar alone at night.
When am I going to be a grownup?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Someone told me I take after my dad.
But Dad's a boy, so how could I?
Mom's a girl like me.{NextPage_49}
If I really took after Dad, would
I have to have a boy's face?{NextPage_49}
Yuck!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes Dad eats a mushroom
in the woods and disappears!
I want to try that, too, but Mom{NextPage_1}gets mad when I find stuff and
just eat it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad was tossing and turning a lot
in his sleep the other night. He
was mumbling, too. It scared me.{NextPage_1}Was he having a weird dream?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today I asked Mom and Dad
how they met, but Mom got all
red-faced and wouldn't tell me.{NextPage_1}Why not? That's mean.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My hair is thick and coarse.
I guess I inherited Dad's hair.
But I wish it weren't so bristly.{NextPage_1}If only I had nice fluffy hair that
would wave softly in the wind...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have a snub nose! Mom tells me
it's part of why I'm so beautiful,
but somehow...{NextPage_1}I think she's just being a mom.
Oh, {CharName_31}--
can't you fix me up?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what {CharName_13}
thinks about me.
Does he like {CharName_16}?{NextPage_1}But what does he think about me?
----------x----------
Uh-oh. I think I've gained
a little weight lately.
I'd better stop snacking on{NextPage_1}things right out of the fridge.
I just get so hungry.
Argh! What to do, what to do...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lately Dad doesn't smell so hot.
Maybe it's that old-person smell...
It really is disgusting.{NextPage_1}I wonder why middle-aged men start
smelling like that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Seems like I grew up before I knew it.
Soon I'll be thinking about marriage.
Hmm... marriage.{NextPage_1}I'd like to get married, but somehow
I can't picture it--having a family...
I wonder what Mom was thinking{NextPage_1}when she was my age?
I'll have to ask her.{NextPage_0}

I ought to stay away from alcohol.
I think I drank too much.
Now I'm worried that I might have{NextPage_1}said some really stupid things.{NextPage_0}

A world beyond an unknown mountain pass.
It may be unknown, but I doubt it's very

----------x----------
Hugh's dad said I ran so fast,
I should think about becoming
an athlete when I grow up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm developing muscles in my calves.
I feel like a gazelle...
I know it's kind of the whole point{NextPage_1}of exercise, but I'd rather not get
huge buff muscles. I'm not into the
brawny bodybuilder look.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I might be a little too athletic.
I'm sure I'm the most sports-
minded girl in Forget-Me-Not Valley ÄduhÖ.{NextPage_1}If I keep this up, I might
even beat Hugh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I went to a training meet and came
home way more flexible than before.
I'll be able to do full splits soon!{NextPage_1}I know I can do it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Could I survive in the world of pro
sports? I wonder about that sometimes.
I'd kind of like to test my skill.{NextPage_1}Unless I change my mind, that is.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You need to find a sponsor before
you can become a pro athlete.
If my talents would truly benefit a{NextPage_1}sponsor, I'm sure one would show up.
Where do I stand right now?
What level am I at?{NextPage_0}

Mom told me I'm pretty good
at singing. Maybe I'll be a singer
when I grow up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I sing, the animals calm down
and start nuzzling each other.
Could my songs have some kind{NextPage_1}of magical power?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Birds sing in musical notes.
Cows moo in musical notes.
Every sound is a note!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can finally sing in a nice, clear
falsetto. A little more practice and
I'll be able to sing in 5 octaves.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My good ear for music comes from
being born in Forget-Me-Not Valley.
That's what Gustafa said.{NextPage_1}Also, quiet nights and bird songs are
essential for developing a good ear.
I didn't know that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I found out that if I put my chin down,
I can really belt out the high notes.
My repertoire just got bigger! Hooray!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How will my songs affect people's hearts?
I'd like to leave the valley and see.
Then again,{NextPage_1}around here, I've only ever
sung anything to Gustafa.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Songs have the power to heal.
I would love to soothe people's
hearts with my songs.{NextPage_1}That's what I've been thinking, anyway.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There was a McCoy special on TV.
I want to move people with my songs,
but instruments are pretty cool, too.{NextPage_1}I was so impressed by the special that
I want to learn an instrument, too...
I guess I'm starting to like the{NextPage_1}sound of the word ♪diva♪.{NextPage_0}

When I showed Patrick my drawing,
he said I had a way with colors.
That made me happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now that I can draw a good circle, I
tried drawing a man using only circles.
It didn't look like a man, though.{NextPage_1}Hmm, this is tough.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I showed {CharName_21} my drawing,
he said I had potential.
What's ♪potential♪? Is it tasty?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just might be an artistic genius--
I drew a perfect portrait of Murrey!
Though I'm still not sure exactly why{NextPage_1}I chose Murrey to model for me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's hard to get the hang of sketching,
but caricatures are even worse!
When I got tired of doing sketches,{NextPage_1}I tried distorting my drawings a little.
They didn't come out that well, and{NextPage_1}I ended up throwing them away...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Somehow I do think I have a talent
for drawing pictures, but I also feel
I have a long way to go before I reach{NextPage_1}a level I can be satisfied with.
I need to improve my sketching
and fine-tune my use of colors, too.{NextPage_1}Basically, I'm still not at the point
where I can really express myself...
That's my biggest challenge... argh!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have so many things I want to
express. I can't do it in words, though.
That's where my art comes in.{NextPage_1}I don't know for sure if my feelings
will come through, but if I can draw
them well enough, I bet they will.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Creativity comes from within.
Or so it's been said. I wonder if
that's really true.{NextPage_1}To make a good piece, you must first
be honest. It won't work if you're
worried about how others see you.{NextPage_1}That has to be my motto, even if
I become a pro artist one day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Being an artist isn't about
making a lot of money.
Still, I'd like to try to earn a living{NextPage_1}with my artwork, if I can.
I can't always live off my parents.
This'll take some thought.{NextPage_1}{NextPage_0}

Since I grew up on a farm, I
know I can make friends with
animals really quickly.{NextPage_0}

I saw a lizard in the forest. He
saw me, too, but he didn't run away.
But then a man came and the lizard{NextPage_1}hid in a little patch of grass.{NextPage_0}

I'm considering taking over the farm.
Mom said she approves, but I'm sure
she really has mixed feelings about it.{NextPage_1}I know it can be pretty hard work
for a girl, but if I don't do it,
who will?{NextPage_1}I still have a lot to learn, but
I'm just positive I can do it!{NextPage_0}

I'll try secretly growing a flower or two.{NextPage_0}

I think I've finally settled on my

Nothing's set in stone yet, but I{NextPage_1}know that's the path I want to follow.

Sometimes Mom sings songs as she
washes the dishes in the kitchen.
She's really good at it, too.{NextPage_1}I want to be a good singer like
Mom is.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Romana told me that
Mom used to be a talented
piano player.{NextPage_1}I've never seen Mom play the
piano. I think I'd like to,
one day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom's always kind, but sometimes
she can get a little selfish.
When I told Romana, she said,{NextPage_1}♪Your mother was raised
like a little princess.♪
Am I a little princess, too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I talk with Mom, I sometimes
think she must have had a really
good upbringing.{NextPage_1}I have Mom's genes, so I know I
could have turned out more elegant,
but since I was born on a farm, I{NextPage_1}guess I'm stuck being who I am...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom may have been raised like a
princess, but she doesn't always act
like one. As a girl, she didn't like{NextPage_1}wearing skirts--she always wore pants.
She said she hated how ♪young ladies♪
were expected to wear skirts and act{NextPage_1}so demure and modest. Somehow I
agree with her there.{NextPage_0}

When Mom and Dad decided to get
married, Romana must have
taught Mom some home basics.{NextPage_1}Mom was a lot younger than I am
now, so I bet it must have been
rough for her...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I realized that at my age, Mom
had already had a baby--me.
I just can't picture myself{NextPage_1}having a baby, though.
It must have hurt like crazy...
Nice work, Mom...and thanks.{NextPage_0}
