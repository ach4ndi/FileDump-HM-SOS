\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f49\u2135Georgia takes such good\u2328care of her horses.\u232bShe makes sure to give\u2328each one all the love and\u2328attention it needs.
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135So we have this new lamb\u2328now called Snow...\u232bShe likes to run away. If\u2328you take your eyes off her\u2328for a second, she's gone!\u232bI guess she still misses\u2328her parents. Poor thing.\u232bShe doesn't seem to be\u2328getting along with the \u2328other animals yet.
\u1f41\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2136Oh no! And there she is now.\u2328Looks like she got out\u2328again.
\u2332 Push her back to her pen.\u2328 Try and talk to her.
\u1f41\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2136Hey, stop it!\u2328Now she's totally stressed\u2328out.
\u1f41\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136I can't believe it.\u2328What did you say to Snow?\u2328\u232bI've never seen anyone\u2328reason with a lamb before.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fa6\u1f4b\u2136But the way you tried to\u2328force her back into her\u2328pen at first hurt to watch.\u232bI could tell from Snow's\u2328cries that she was really\u2328scared.
\u1f41\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Oh well.\u2328I'm glad she went\u2328back to her pen.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Thanks, \u232a.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Well, I want to check on\u2328Snow, so I should be\u2328getting home.

\u1f41\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136I can't believe she just\u2328headed off to her pen on\u2328her own.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Thanks, \u232a.\u232bIt looks like there are some\u2328things I could learn from\u2328you about animal care!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa6\u1f48\u2136Alright! Well, I want to\u2328check on Snow, so I should\u2328be getting home.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136Thanks! Let's hang out\u2328again soon. See you\u2328later, \u232a!
