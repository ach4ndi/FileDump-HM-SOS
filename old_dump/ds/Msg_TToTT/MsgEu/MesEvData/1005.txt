\u1f41\u1faa\u1f4b\u2136*Yawn*...
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Oh, pardon me.\u2328I haven't been getting\u2328enough sleep recently.\u232bI'm writing a song, but it's\u2328not coming out the way I had\u2328in mind.\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f4c\u2136So I find myself staying\u2328up late into the night...
\u2332 Could I help in some way?\u2328 Maybe you lack talent...?
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Oh? You'd like to offer your\u2328assistance?
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f49\u2136Thank you. That's very\u2328generous.\u232bI think I will take you up\u2328on your offer.
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f4c\u2136The question is...help in\u2328what way?\u232bHmmm.\u2328Well, here's an idea...\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136I'd appreciate it if you'd\u2328find some sound that can\u2328inspire me.\u232bA loud sound, a soft sound,\u2328a weird sound, a painful\u2328sound...any sound at all.
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136Hmm?\u2328You thought of one?
\u1f40\u1faa\u1f48\u2135This bell?\u2328Come to think of it, I've\u2328never heard it rung.\u232bBut how do we ring it?
\u1f40\u1faa\u1f4c\u2135Sometimes you really do the\u2328most surprising things...
\u1f40\u1faa\u1f48\u2135I've got it...
\u1f40\u1faa\u1f49\u2135That musical phrase that\u2328just wouldn't come to me!\u2328It's miraculous!\u232b\u1f40\u1faa\u1f48\u2135Now I feel as though I can\u2328finish my song.\u232b\u1f40\u1faa\u1f49\u2135Thank you, \u232a!\u232bIncredible how it came\u2328to me so easily now...\u2328I'm so glad I talked to you!
\u1f40\u1faa\u1f48\u2135I've got to get back and\u2328write that song right away.\u2328See you later, \u232a.
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f4a\u2136How could you think that?\u2328What a rude thing to say!\u2328
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f4b\u2136Your voice seems to grate\u2328on my ears today, disturbing\u2328my harmony.
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f4b\u2136I'm sorry, but I will be\u2328going home now.\u2328Goodbye, \u232a.
