\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Spring is indeed splendid.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136This season is a balm to my\u2328soul.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136The cherry blossoms will\u2328soon be in peak bloom.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136I feel the urge to go\u2328picnicking!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136The weather has warmed\u2328considerably.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Be mindful of the changeable\u2328weather! You would not want\u2328to catch a cold!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Spring is so marvelous...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136This is a splendid time of\u2328year to go foraging on the\u2328mountain.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Each day seems hotter than\u2328the last.\u232bBe mindful to drink enough\u2328water and avoid heatstroke.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136The summer night sky and its\u2328countless stars are sublime!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136I feel a thrill just gazing\u2328up into the heavens.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Another hot day.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136If you ever start to feel\u2328unwell, don't dismiss it!\u2328Come and consult me.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136I see that you are holding\u2328up well in this heat...\u232bAs for me, I wilt in the\u2328summer...
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136This season brings pleasant\u2328weather.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Reading is just the thing\u2328for autumn.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136It is important to build up\u2328one's energy in the fall to\u2328prepare for winter ahead.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4a\u2136But do be careful not to\u2328overeat!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136The temperature swings\u2328abruptly now in the mornings\u2328and evenings.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Take ample precautions to\u2328preserve your health.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Such a pleasant season!\u232bIt is a splendid time to go\u2328bird watching on the\u2328mountain, don't you agree?
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136The weather has turned cold.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136Be sure to dress in warm\u2328clothing whenever you\u2328venture outside.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136There is less wildlife to be\u2328seen in the winter months...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136I look forward to their\u2328reemergence after\u2328the rigors of winter.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136I see you are holding up\u2328well in this cold...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136I hope that no one will fall\u2328ill in this winter season...
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136When it's cold outside, one\u2328must stay active!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136That's the theory, anyhow.\u2328But this cold is actually\u2328quite bitter.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Fair weather makes a day\u2328simply grand!\u232bIt's great weather to get\u2328organized and get your\u2328chores done!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136One's spirits rise when the\u2328weather is fair!\u232bI do adore clear, sunny\u2328days!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Once, as a child, I tried to\u2328climb onto a rainbow.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136I chased it and chased it,\u2328but I could never catch it.\u232bI got so frustrated\u2328eventually, I burst into\u2328tears.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Fine weather makes me want\u2328to burst into song!\u232bIn fact, you and I should\u2328sing together right now!\u2328Shall we?
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Such driving rain, isn't it?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136The other day I slipped and\u2328fell on a rain-slicked road.\u232bIt was an embarrassing\u2328episode...
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136If you become drenched by\u2328the rain, you should dry off\u2328fast, or you'll catch cold.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Do be mindful of it.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136As a small boy, I would make\u2328paper cranes on rainy days,\u2328wishing the sun to come out.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136But my wish was never once\u2328granted by the weather\u2328clearing up, I'm afraid.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136Such driving rain, isn't it?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136I hope that tomorrow brings\u2328fairer weather!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Such driving rain, isn't it?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136The other day I slipped and\u2328fell on a rain-slicked road.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136Many people witnessed it,\u2328causing me no small\u2328embarrassment.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136The other day, Kana made a\u2328snow bear to amuse me.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136I-I'm embarrassed to say\u2328that I mistook it for a\u2328real one and ran away.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136I must say, I am not gifted\u2328in winter sports...\u232bI find it terribly difficult\u2328to balance on a surface of\u2328snow or ice.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136It is snowing heavily.\u2328Take care that you do not\u2328lose your footing.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136You must excuse me...\u232bI...I do not like this place\u2328at all.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136.........\u232bI find this spot to be...\u2328too...elevated, don't you?\u232bI'm terribly sorry but...\u232bI...I'm...I'm frightened!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Today was very pleasurable.\u232bWe must converse again like\u2328this sometime.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Thank you ever so much for\u2328today.\u232bFarewell!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136For today, I must...\u2328take my leave of you...\u232bPardon me...
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Today was very pleasurable.\u232bWe must spend time like\u2328this more often in the\u2328future.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4d\u2136\u232a...\u232bI have something of utmost\u2328import to discuss with you.\u232bWould you please accompany\u2328me to a place we may talk?
\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f49\u2135Today was very pleasurable.\u232bWe must converse again like\u2328this sometime.

\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Animals are such a marvel. \u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136If you raise more animals,\u2328perhaps you will expand\u2328your knowledge as a farmer.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Animals are such a marvel. \u232bAnd indeed I see that you\u2328have greatly increased the\u2328livestock in your care!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136It must require much work to\u2328care for them, yet surely\u2328the benefits are also great.\u232bKeep up the good work!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Animals are such a marvel.\u232bIt is truly remarkable how\u2328many animals you're raising.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136I stand in admiration!\u2328I have much to learn from\u2328you to better my own effort.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136By the way, I heard that you\u2328collect bugs and frogs.\u232b.........\u232bIt appears that you are only\u2328just beginning in that line.\u232bIt seems a pity to capture\u2328them...\u232bSimply to observe them is\u2328a pleasure.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136By the way, I heard that you\u2328collect bugs and frogs.\u232b.........\u232bIt appears that you have\u2328quite a collection.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136It seems a pity to capture\u2328them, though... Why not set\u2328them free after a time?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Simply to observe bugs is\u2328a pleasure in itself.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136By the way, I heard that you\u2328collect bugs and frogs.\u232b.........\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136You have collected a great\u2328many of them indeed!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136I cannot help but feel it\u2328is a pity to keep them\u2328captive, though...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Still, your passion for this\u2328hobby is evident!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136By the way, I have heard\u2328that you keep a record of\u2328all the fish you catch.\u232b.........\u232bIt appears that you are only\u2328just beginning in that line.\u232bYou will find different fish\u2328in different seasons and\u2328places, you know.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Give it your best effort!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136By the way, I have heard\u2328that you keep a record of\u2328all the fish you catch.\u232b.........\u232bThis seems to be a fairly\u2328good collection.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136But there must be more fish\u2328out there if you search\u2328with all your might!

\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136I do love to cook, you know!\u232bDo you enjoy cooking,\u2328\u232a?
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136My dream is to become a\u2328doctor and help many\u2328people.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136In assisting Dr. Ayame, my\u2328responsibilities take me all\u2328around Konohana.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136All the villagers are such\u2328kind people. I do love\u2328this town!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Kana is truly a man's man.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136He is kind and dependable,\u2328and I hold him in the utmost\u2328regard.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136There are festivals all\u2328throughout the year in\u2328Konohana.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136They provide opportunities\u2328to spend time with people.\u2328I often take part myself.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136\u232a,\u2328do you like to cook?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Food that is cooked with\u2328passion is the most\u2328delicious!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136In the past, I would often\u2328faint at the sight of blood.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136Now it no longer bothers me,\u2328but I still do not care for\u2328the color red...
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136I often dine at Yun's\u2328establishment.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136The food there has the home-\u2328cooked flavor I love.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136The other day when I was\u2328doing the laundry, the\u2328clinic's sheets blew away.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Kana came to the rescue and\u2328helped me catch them.\u232bHe is truly a kind man.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136The village Music Festival\u2328is held once per year and\u2328is always enjoyable.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136I would like to take part\u2328someday if I can.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136When I was a little boy, I\u2328made omelet rice for my\u2328mother.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136I had put my best effort\u2328into making it, and she ate\u2328it with delight.\u232bSo omelet rice is a dish\u2328that still evokes memories\u2328for me.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136I have always had a dislike\u2328for tomatoes...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136I hate to be discourteous\u2328to our fine farmers, but I\u2328simply cannot eat them.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136I often deliver medicines to\u2328Ying's house on behalf of\u2328Dr. Ayame.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136I am pleased that she is\u2328doing better these days.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Have you ever ridden a\u2328horse, \u232a?\u232bI recently rode on a horse\u2328of Kana's!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136In no time, I fell off and\u2328was covered in mud,\u2328though...

\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136The other day I cooked my\u2328specialty, omelet rice, for\u2328Dr. Ayame.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4a\u2136And her reaction was most\u2328distressing!\u232bShe added spices to the\u2328omelet rice that I had made\u2328before even trying it!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136Obviously the good doctor\u2328lacks the slightest inkling\u2328of what omelet rice is!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4a\u2136The key to the flavor is the\u2328precise proportions of the\u2328ingredients!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Years ago, since I refused\u2328to eat tomatoes, my parents\u2328came up with "Tomato Day."\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136They cooked nothing but\u2328tomato dishes all day long.\u232bIt was a traumatic\u2328experience for me and I did\u2328not learn to like tomatoes.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Nevertheless, I am grateful\u2328that my parents were trying\u2328to find ways to help me...
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136The other day, I delivered\u2328medicine to Yun's house.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4d\u2136And Yun actually patted me\u2328on the head!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136It was embarrassing, yet at\u2328the same time, it is nice\u2328to be appreciated.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136The other day during heavy\u2328rain, I saw a cat swept away\u2328by the river.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136I was with Kana, and he\u2328leaped right into the\u2328river to save the cat...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Kana was very heroic on\u2328that occasion!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Mikhail is a musician who\u2328has traveled to many places.\u232bHe plays superbly!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136I would love to perform\u2328with him someday.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136The other day, I cooked my\u2328specialty, omelet rice, for\u2328Dr. Ayame.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4a\u2136And her reaction was most\u2328distressing!\u232bShe added spices to the\u2328omelet rice that I had made\u2328before eating it!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136Obviously the good doctor\u2328lacks the slightest inkling\u2328of what omelet rice is!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4a\u2136The key to the flavor is the\u2328precise proportion of the\u2328ingredients!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136I've heard of a festival\u2328somewhere in the world where\u2328people throw tomatoes...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136Ugh...\u2328It sounds horrible...
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136The other day, I delivered\u2328medicine to Yun's house.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136And her granddaughter Ying\u2328actually patted me on the\u2328head!\u232bWhy on earth did she do\u2328that? Was she simply showing\u2328her gratitude?
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136It is my ambition to become\u2328a man like Kana.\u232bA man who always acts to\u2328protect the lives of others\u2328in any situation.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136I still have much growing to\u2328do, but I will learn how to\u2328help all the people I can.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136I feel that music holds a\u2328mysterious power to soothe\u2328the human soul.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Music is indeed marvelous!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136I was born and raised in\u2328Konohana...\u232bWhile studying medicine,\u2328however, I lived with my\u2328father in the city.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136\u232a, are you able to\u2328eat spicy foods?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136I cannot abide them...
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136I want to become a superb\u2328doctor like my father.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136That is why I am serving\u2328as an apprentice to Dr.\u2328Ayame now.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136What do you think of this\u2328village of Konohana?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136I think it is a marvelous\u2328community.\u232bI hope that it finds a\u2328special place in your heart\u2328too, \u232a.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136\u232a,\u2328how is life treating you?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136If you ever need help, let\u2328me know, and I'll do my best\u2328to assist you.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136After I completed my medical\u2328studies and returned to\u2328Konohana...\u232bI recall how delighted I was\u2328that the village had not\u2328changed a bit.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4d\u2136When everyone told me,\u2328"Welcome home, Hiro!"...\u2328I burst into tears!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136\u232a, are you able to\u2328eat spicy foods?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136I cannot endure them...
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Dr. Ayame, under whom I am\u2328training, is a woman with\u2328a generous heart.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136She can be a little too\u2328casual about some things,\u2328but she is kind.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136The bamboo that grows in our\u2328village is rarely found\u2328elsewhere.\u232bIt is one of many rare\u2328species found in Konohana.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136\u232a,\u2328do you keep your place\u2328clean and orderly?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136Dr. Ayame flings things\u2328here and there, making\u2328cleaning up a chore.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136My father runs a clinic in\u2328the city.\u232bMy mother's health is frail,\u2328and the city has better\u2328facilities for her care.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136I cannot abide spicy food.\u2328I never eat spicy curry.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136But I do enjoy mild curries.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Recently I have been given\u2328more work-related\u2328responsibilities.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Now they occupy as much of\u2328my time as household chores.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Konohana has a type of rare\u2328pine tree found nowhere\u2328else.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136They are very difficult to\u2328grow, but the villagers\u2328tend them lovingly.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136I have always enjoyed\u2328cleaning.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136If you ever have an oily\u2328stain, just wipe it with\u2328a cloth soaked in acetone.\u232bThe stain will come right\u2328off!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Have you had the opportunity\u2328to drink Konohana tea yet?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136It is very healthy and\u2328delicious.\u2328I adore tea!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136I cannot abide spicy food.\u2328I never eat spicy curry.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136But I do enjoy mild curries.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Recently I have been given\u2328more work-related\u2328responsibilities.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Now they occupy as much of\u2328my time as household chores.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Many villagers here are very\u2328handy craftspeople.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136There are numerous buildings\u2328with unusual architecture.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136Shoes become dirty so\u2328quickly...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136But did you know\u2328orange peels are excellent\u2328for cleaning leather shoes?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136They lift stains from white\u2328leather and give a shine to\u2328dyed leather.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136I send tea harvested here in\u2328Konohana to my mother in\u2328the city.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Tea is splendid for one's\u2328health.\u232bYou must try my special tea\u2328blend one of these days!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136The other day, Kana served\u2328me curry at his house.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136It was blazingly spicy and\u2328I was unable to eat a single\u2328bite of it.\u232bI simply cannot abide spicy\u2328curries...
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136Sometimes villagers overwork\u2328themselves and faint.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136But when Dr. Ayame gives\u2328one of her potent shots,\u2328they perk right back up.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136If you are ever feeling\u2328under the weather, please\u2328let me know.\u232bI will do whatever I can to\u2328assist you.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136There are many kinds of\u2328carts, you know.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4a\u2136Including certain special\u2328ones whose manufacture is a\u2328closely guarded secret.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136I would love to see all the\u2328different types of carts!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136Even when one cleans every\u2328day, somehow there is always\u2328dust building up.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136But if you lay wet newspaper\u2328on the floor and mop, it\u2328will keep the dust down.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136\u232a,\u2328do you know about the maker\u2328sheds?\u232bDifferent makers produce\u2328different items!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136It's always so exciting when\u2328you're waiting for an item\u2328to come out of the maker!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Mayor Ina's son Rahi is a\u2328marvelous boy.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136He made a drawing for me\u2328just the other day.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Do you like books,\u2328\u232a?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Books are a source of all\u2328kinds of knowledge. That is\u2328why I love them.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136The other day, Mako gave us\u2328an apple pie.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136He even wrapped it prettily\u2328for Dr. Ayame and myself.\u2328\u232bMako is very skilled at\u2328handicrafts.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136\u232a...\u232bYou are...\u270b\u2328\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136an interesting person!\u232bI always enjoy talking with\u2328you a great deal.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Do you know about the\u2328maker sheds?\u232bDifferent makers produce\u2328different items!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136It's always so exciting when\u2328you're waiting for an item\u2328to come out of the maker!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136The other day, I delivered\u2328medicine to Yun's house, and\u2328encountered Rahi there.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136What a remarkable lad!\u232bDespite his young years, he\u2328can recite pi to the 10th\u2328digit!\u232bI asked him to join me in\u2328reciting through the 100th\u2328digit, but he went home.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136By the way, \u232a,\u2328do you read many books?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136The town hall has an\u2328extensive library. A most\u2328useful resource!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136The other day, Mako gave us\u2328an apple pie.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136He even wrapped it prettily\u2328for Dr. Ayame and myself.\u2328\u232bMako is very skilled at\u2328handicrafts.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136\u232a...\u232bYou are...\u270b\u2328\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136a good person.\u232bIt warms my heart whenever\u2328we converse together.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136The maker sheds can make\u2328all kinds of things.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136I adore pickles, so I make\u2328them and eat them every day!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136The other day, I delivered\u2328medicine to Yun's house, and\u2328encountered Rahi there.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136For some reason, he\u2328challenged me to a bout of\u2328sumo wrestling...
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136In my childhood, I loved\u2328to look at picture books.\u232bDid you know that different\u2328insects come out in\u2328different areas and seasons?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136I can still recite all the\u2328insects I learned in my\u2328picture books.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Mayor Ina is indeed a\u2328stylish woman!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136And very knowledgeable as\u2328well!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136\u232a...\u232bYou are...\u270b\u2328\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136a kind person.\u232bI have the utmost respect\u2328for how considerate you are\u2328toward others.

\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136The other day, I engaged in\u2328a sumo wrestling bout with\u2328Rahi.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136I was astounded at the boy's\u2328strength! It so surprised me\u2328that I lost the bout.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Since my childhood, I have\u2328loved picture books.\u232bThere are so many fish in\u2328the world's seas and rivers\u2328that I have never seen.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Someday I would like to take\u2328a trip and swim with those\u2328exotic fish.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136Alas! I am hopeless as a\u2328swimmer...

\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136There are many different\u2328kinds of pickles.\u232bPickled cucumbers, pickled\u2328carrots, pickled radishes...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136I intend to try making\u2328pickles from all sorts of\u2328ingredients.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Rahi is such a wonderful\u2328lad.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136The other day, I delivered\u2328medicine to Ying's house.\u232bOn the way back, Rahi said\u2328to me, "I won't let you\u2328beat me!" as a greeting.\u232bI am unsure what he meant,\u2328but I am glad that he is\u2328more friendly toward me now.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136Since my childhood, I have\u2328loved picture books.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136The human body is indeed\u2328a marvel!\u232bIt fascinates me that even\u2328now, there is so much we do\u2328not understand about it.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136The other day, I ran into\u2328Sheng.\u232bHe is a very talkative man,\u2328and had much to tell me\u2328about pandas.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Sheng certainly does love\u2328pandas!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4d\u2136Um, ahhh, that is...\u2328You see...\u232bYou are a...\u2328most charming girl.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136How many years have passed\u2328since we first met?\u232bIt feels like many indeed,\u2328and yet like no time at all.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4d\u2136I trust that we will be\u2328together forever!\u2328\u232bNothing shall ever change\u2328my love for you, \u2391!
