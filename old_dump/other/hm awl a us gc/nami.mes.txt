Our time together was so short...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}...
Could you play something special...
...For {CharName_0}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I'll just take a little look...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So what are you selling?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, are you listening to me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}{34_1_123}Ha ha ha! Is this your first day here?
You don't have anything to sell!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}{34_1_123}What's the point? Hahaha.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Tell me when you actually have something.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll pay well for interesting stuff.
Good luck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Anything good here...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I'll do a little shopping...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I'll give up for today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How much is the {29_0}?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
Hmm...
{50_4_0_9}Why are you giving me a discount?
{50_4_0_0}Well, OK. I'll take it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm...
No, I guess not.
Later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a little expensive. But OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That just makes me want it more...
Oh well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't want it anymore.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}...............{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}Maybe it's something I ate...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_26}What? Are you a dog or something?
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}.................{NextPage_1}{50_4_0_9}What do you want?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}...........Sigh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_4}Stop smiling like a moron.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_125}Let me guess. You're a morning person?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
“Hello there!”{32_1_244}
No, that's just not me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
“Howdy.”
Nope, that's no good either.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello...
I like this time of day best.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_125}I guess even people like you
sometimes stay out to this hour, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you normally visit people at this hour?
It's a little late, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is where I'm staying.
Can we do this later?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_125}You come here often?
Hmm... I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_125}Geez, what a coincidence.
I guess I should be going.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that?
Huh. Really...
{41_2_0}Try it.
Looks good, huh?
----------x----------
...........{50_4_0_10}I'll give it a try.
{34_1_123}You're kind of strange, aren't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It doesn't really matter what I think,
does it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
................
I'll have {CharName_25} make something for me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, that looks great.
{41_2_0}Do you want it?
You can't have it.
----------x----------
I don't know if I'd go that far, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't particularly want it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now that I look at it, it's not so great.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ugh...
That doesn't look appetizing at all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't even consider that food...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You like that kind of stuff?
What a weirdo.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Uh, thanks, but you can just keep
that for yourself, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looking forward to them growing up?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a good thing your kid doesn't look
like your husband... I guess I shouldn't
{50_4_0_10}say that in front of the kid, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Heehee. {50_4_0_10}Look at those chubby cheeks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you think your kid will like growing
crops as much as your husband?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cute smile...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What tiny little hands and feet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looking forward to them growing up?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Personally, I'm glad the kid takes
after you.
Otherwise...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ha ha ha! {50_4_0_10}Look at those chubby cheeks!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Look at that smile!♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That kid's really friendly for being so
young. That's your kid all right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What tiny little hands and feet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see a resemblance to your husband
around the eyes. Yep, that kid looks
like a smart one, all right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That kid's hair is pretty bushy.
Looks a little wild.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ha ha ha! {50_4_0_10}Look at those chubby cheeks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cute kid, but have you ever seen a kid who
looks old even though they're so young?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How cute...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What tiny little hands and feet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a sheepdog?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No, I guess not.
It looks like a pet...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}Oh, a cat!
{34_1_123}How cute!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that some cats live in two
houses at once, just taking advantage of
their owners. Can you believe that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, a chicken!
Is it from your farm? Hmm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Its little red comb and wattle are cute.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Aww! How cute!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Baby chicks are so soft and cuddly.
You just want to pet them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Wow.
A duck. Cool!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow.
Is that a duck?
Wow, it's pretty small.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Aren't ducks usually wild animals?
But you have one for a pet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Geese look kind of like ducks, but they
have little knobs on their bills.
No geese in {Location_43_30_23}, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of seed is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope it grows into a big tree.
Or maybe it's not that kind of seed?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow.
Did you grow that on your farm?
Cool.
{41_2_0}You can have it.
They're for sale.
----------x----------
Well, that's nice of you.
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Haha.
What, are you advertising or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If it's a crop I've never had before,
I might be interested in buying it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Milk, huh?
I milked a cow once, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Ooh, cheese.
{50_4_0_2}Sniff sniff....
{34_1_123}Not bad!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can make lots of kinds of
cheese depending on the kind of
milk, right? That's neat!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Butter, huh?
You can make that just using milk?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess it's the milk that decides how
butter tastes, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The harder the shell, the better the
egg. It means that the chicken's
well fed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take care that they don't get stressed
out. I know I hate being stressed out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Wow, cool!!
Been fishing, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like fishing. I like to roast and eat
the fish right there on the riverbank.
Fish have to be fresh, you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A wild plant, huh?
I guess those can be good in some dishes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are some pretty strange plants in
{Location_43_30_23}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's this?
Oh, did you make that?
Wow.
{41_2_0}You can have it.
It turned out well.
----------x----------
{34_1_124}For me......?
Uh, OK.
{50_4_0_10}Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you eat it at home?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that a hoe?
Kind of an unusual shape, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How is that different from a normal hoe?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}Woah, what is that thing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You like carrying things like that around?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}{34_1_123}Wow, you must be really happy about
getting a new tool if you carry it around.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well don't just go around showing it to
people. Use it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you're working pretty hard.
I can tell by looking at your hoe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going to go digging? If you
dig up anything interesting,
show me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that from a museum or do you use it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
As long as it works, I guess it doesn't
matter how it looks, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A sickle?
That's pretty weird.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a sickle?
{34_1_123}It's kind of funny looking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a new sickle?
You really like farming, don't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why are you walking around with that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you been using that all this time?
It's practically an antique!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't point that thing at me.
OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_124}What?
You plan to water me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No thanks.
If I want some water, I'll just go to
the {Location_43_33_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you use that thing to milk your cows?
{34_1_123}Neat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet you can get a lot of milk with that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, you use those to cut
sheep wool?
That looks challenging.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet it takes a long time using those.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, clippers.
Going to shear your sheep?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know, those clippers look kind
like they're for humans...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got a nice tool there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, good luck with that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you find that in {Location_43_30_23}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I find things like that, I feel
like I'm a little child again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You found something impressive there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe it's really a valuable artifact...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You really like living off the land, huh?
Just a reminder: You can't eat flowers.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know about the taste, but I wonder
if it's good for your body to eat those.
Anyway, I'm not interested.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Ooh, a record!
Can you play it at your house?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cool, a record.
I wish they'd get a player at the
{Location_43_35_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did {CharName_25} give you some of her spice?
That {CharName_25}'s quite a cook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_25} mixes her own
spices, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}{50_4_0_10}Hey, that's nice...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}I think I'll just listen to it for a bit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that a little bling bling for you?
Oh, you got it from {CharName_11}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll just never understand some people.
Why would someone give their medal away?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that necklace from the {Location_43_41_23}?
{34_1_123}Neat. Maybe it's cursed...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You'd better take good care of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_9} gave you that, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've sure got a lot of different things.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}{34_1_123}Hahahaha!
Somebody gave you a firecracker?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}You'd have be crazy to take
something like that!
{50_4_0_3}But it looks like a blast.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can never tell what you have in
your rucksack. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Show me the inside of your bag sometime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A lot of people ask me why I'm traveling.
I don't really have a reason, so I
never know how to answer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I never forget the people who were kind to
me. Take you for example...{NextPage_49}
What was your name again?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes I just get the urge to
start traveling.
I'm just following my instincts.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't imagine owning my own land
like you do... It would stifle me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know, I once met someone named
Aja on my travels. I wonder what he's
doing now...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I tried the {29_0} that you
gave me.
It was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that {29_0}?
I gave it to {CharName_25}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I tried the {29_0} that you
gave me.
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About that {29_0} you gave me...
I asked {CharName_25} to make something
with it.{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_10}Everyone said it was good.
{34_1_123}You're not bad, you know that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}The {29_0} you gave me was
{34_1_123}really good.
That's one of my favorites.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me sure
tasted nutritious.
You know what I mean?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Kind of sweet... It was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I tried the {29_0}.
Actually, that's one of my favorites.
{50_4_0_10}I didn't know you were such a good cook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I tried the {29_0} you gave me.
I wouldn't mind some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I gave that {29_0} you gave me
to {CharName_26}.{NextPage_49}
He just wouldn't take his eyes off of it.
Maybe he likes that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're looking good.
Like lord of the animals or something.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Growing delicious vegetables is a kind
of magical, isn't it?{NextPage_49}
After all, they have the power to make
the people who eat them happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The food you cook is really
good.
Maybe you should change careers.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Humans do pretty much the same things
at the same time every day.
That's true of the people here, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Village folk find comfort by doing the
same things over and over. But you
can overdo it, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like the people who come to the
{Location_43_33_23}. They're straightforward.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think it's important for there to be
places where kids can't go.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't have anything do to?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Not that there's anything wrong with that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ruby and Tim sure get along well.
I wonder if marriage is really like that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I'm not really cut out
for the whole marriage thing...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The people here are so peaceful.
I'll never be like that, but I can't help
wishing I could be...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Time seems to flow differently in {Location_112_165_168}get-{17}
{Location_119_155_106}Not{17}. Maybe that's why I can't leave.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Even if you don't do anything, time
keeps passing...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Even if you don't do anything, time
keeps going.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ruby's a good person, isn't she?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They say kids grow up like their parents,
but I don't think that's true.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Farming looks pretty difficult.
I don't think I'm cut out for it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Farmers always have nice muscle tone.
----------x----------
The people here are always so happy
when spring rolls around.
But I never really change.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The people here are all pretty warm and
friendly, but I bet they all have
problems of their own...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This place always makes me feel
kind of nostalgic, you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I keep planning on leaving, but I ended
up spending another year here...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But I guess Spring is the
most cheerful of the four seasons.
With flowers blooming and such.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Meetings and farewells are two sides of
the same coin. Don't you think?{NextPage_50}$BreakPage {CharName_1}{50_4_0_10}Just kidding.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}Whew..............!
Whew..............!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}What? I'm hot and in
a bad mood, so stay away from me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}I feel like I'm gonna melt!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}I bet you can't work in this kind of heat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}Ugh......
I'm melting! I'm melting!{32_1_244}
Maybe I should go play in the river...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish it would hurry up and get cooler.
I don't feel like doing anything...
Not that I ever really do anything anyway.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
To us, the falling leaves may seem sad
and lonely. But to the trees, it's just
another part of their lives.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Leaves are pretty amazing.
They turn color and look pretty.
They fall and remind us it's autumn.{NextPage_49}
And you can even use them to make a fire
and cook some food.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Leaves sure are amazing...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That wind is pretty chilly.
If you let your guard down at this
time of year, you can catch cold.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The leaves sure are pretty.
Time flies...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel like writing a poem...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what it'd be like to hibernate...
I bet it'd be cold in the ground...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's cold, huh?
But I kind of like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's cold, but I always feel like walking
around in the winter.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The snow never piles up around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Aren't you cold in that outfit?
I wish I had a thicker coat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Another year gone.
Over before you know it.
I guess that's what life is like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you know what's on the other side of
the ocean? It's better if you don't know.
That way you can use your imagination.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The sound of the waves...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish this place was more remote and
away from the rest of the world.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}I don't like being spoken to here.
But since it's you, I'll allow it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was listening to the forest sounds.
It was just getting interesting, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you listen really hard, I bet you can
hear some interesting things too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder where this river leads to...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The water is so clear and sparkly.
If I were a fish, I'd like to live here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to go out to sea, to someplace
I've never been before.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you need something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}I asked you what you wanted!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Playing an instrument looks fun. Listening
feels great, so playing music
must be even better, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks like there are a lot of
instruments here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I'll ask Gustafa to teach me
what he knows about them...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know much about instruments,
but I know what kind of music I like.
Something free and easy. Like me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everyone here seems to have problems.
I wish I could tell them to enjoy what
they've got.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like to listen to music that you can
close your eyes and relax to.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It can be fun to drink with your friends.
It makes you feel better and you can
forget about your problems.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Stone Oil, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey,{50_4_0_10}{38_3}drink up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whee!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm feeling pretty good right now.
{50_4_0_10}Ha ha ha! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hm?
Wasn't Celia down there?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Celia's room smells nice.
It's not a manufactured scent like a
perfume. Just a nice natural smell.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It must be hard to take care of living
things. Especially with plants that
grow so slowly.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The plants here are arranged in neat rows.
That gardener must be really together.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The people who live in the Villa get to
see this garden every day, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You really have to focus to
be able to smell the plants and the soil.
But it all smells good, you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what plants think about us
growing them?{NextPage_49}
I mean, even if they grow up big
and strong, we're just going to
eat them all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry, I'm a little busy right now.
Could you make it later?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry, but thanks!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's chilly today.
Why does it have to rain?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've noticed that the people here
don't seem to pay much attention to the
rain.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess they're at one with nature...
Or do they just ignore the rain?{32_1_244}
{50_4_0_10}No, that can't be...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When the weather is like this I tend to
remember bad experiences from my past.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Aren't your clothes wet?
You should go home and change.
You might catch cold.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You'd think the clouds would be empty
pretty soon with all the rain like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard there's a farmer in Mineral Town
who's won a dog disk catching contest ten times.
He must really like that dog.{NextPage_49}
Maybe there's more free time over there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard there's a farmer in Mineral Town
who won a bunch of horse races.
Did you know that?{NextPage_49}
Why farm if you can raise racehorses? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer in Mineral Town
is a chicken lord and all chickens bow
before her.{NextPage_49}
She's unstoppable at the chicken festival.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard there's a farmer in Mineral Town
who's won the cow festival many times.
Did you know that?{NextPage_49}
I'd like to eat a prize-winning cow.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard there's a farmer in Mineral Town
who's won the sheep festival many times.
Did you know that?{NextPage_49}
I wonder if those sheep are tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to go to bed soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to bed.
Um. Please leave. Now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you ever sleep? Night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to be going out soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um, I'm going out now,
so catch a clue, okay?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, isn't it nice to
