\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136I've been working awfully\u2328hard on my cooking lately.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Laney and I used to bake a\u2328lot when we were younger, so\u2328I'm a fair hand at baking.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136I've never been much\u2328good at cooking anything\u2328else, though.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136But I want to take another\u2328shot at cooking.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4d\u2136I'm sure I can get the hang\u2328of it!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Hey, I've got an idea!\u2328Let's have a picnic on the\u2328mountain!\u232bI'll make us some\u2328tasty rice balls!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Great! I'll go get started\u2328on 'em!\u232bWhy don't you go wait for me\u2328on the mountain, \u232a?\u2328I'll meet you when I'm done.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136Thanks for waiting!\u232bDo forgive me. I didn't\u2328think I would take so long.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Tada! Here they are!\u2328My extra special\u2328rice balls!\u232bGo ahead and try one!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136H-How is it?
\u2332 Really good!\u2328 It tastes weird...
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136Why, I'm so glad!\u232bWell, I'm famished too!\u2328Let's eat!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4b\u2136Ugh!\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4a\u2136\u20d1This is so sweet!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4b\u2136I'm so used to making sweet\u2328things, I added sugar\u2328without thinking.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136How sweet of you to lie\u2328and tell me it was good!\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4b\u2136I'm so sorry you had to eat\u2328that, though.\u2328\u232bHere I thought I could\u2328at least make rice balls...\u2328Guess I was wrong.\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4c\u2136I'll never be any good at\u2328cooking.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4b\u2136You think I can get the hang\u2328of it? Well, that's kind of\u2328you.
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136That's it!\u232b\u1f41\u1fac\u1f4a\u2136No more focusing on nothing\u2328but animals! Starting today,\u2328I'm going to learn to cook!
\u1f41\u1fac\u1f48\u2136I'm gonna work really hard\u2328at it!
