\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136As a matter of fact, I come\u2328by on occasion to have Yun\u2328teach me her secret recipes!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136On my days off, I often use\u2328those recipes to cook meals\u2328for Dr. Ayame.\u232bIt may be immodest of me to\u2328say so, but I do feel\u2328confident in my cooking!
