A {13}Blue Feather{17}?
What is that for? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's with this?
{41_2_0}Please marry me!
It's nothing.
----------x----------
If you say so...
It sure is a pretty
feather, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you
thinking? I know you
have a girlfriend!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why ask me?!
I can't believe this
is happening to me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You already showed
me that, remember?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You sure are
pushy, you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...?
What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You remembered my
birthday...{NextPage_49}
Thanks...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay, but let me put
{CharName_1} to
bed first.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...He's asleep now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...!!{NextPage_49}
What are you
doing?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...?!
But this is my
room...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Oh.
Sorry...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you here alone
too? Want to watch
the ocean together?
{41_2_0}Sorry, but no.
Sure.
----------x----------
That's too bad.
Bye now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was getting lonely
by myself. Thanks
for coming.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
By now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Hmm?
What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...?
What?
Is this for me?{NextPage_49}
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel like we're
lovers again before
we were married.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's because of you
that we are happy
together.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope we'll be
happy together
forever.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Huh?
That smells good.
Is today special?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My birthday?!
Who told you that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ha! Even I forgot,
I guess.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Hmm?
What?
{41_2_0}Happy birthday!
Oh, nothing.
----------x----------
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
??
What an odd guy
you are.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was wondering where
you were.{NextPage_49}
Should have known
you were drinking
with the guys.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take your time.
Just don't expect me
to bring you food.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, I'm
heading back now.
I'm exhausted today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why is it that men
always find energy to
drink...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, there are
ducks in the pond!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if they got
lost...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can we keep them?
{41_2_0}Sure.
No way.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We've got to think
of a good name.{NextPage_49}
What would a good
male name be?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...That's too bad.
We should let them
go, then...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Input_128}? {32_3_232}
How about the girl
one?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Input_128}? {32_3_232}
Let's show them where
the {Location_43_21_23} is.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nothing... I didn't
come to see you.
Get to work. Go.{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}What is it?
If you say so.
----------x----------
Yeah, but..
Well, I guess I'll
go home for now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?
Thanks. I'll just
kick back and relax.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going home now,
{CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Life on the farm
must be interesting.
I envy you, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No one's here. It
should be okay.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Drinking with me
won't be very
much fun, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why I did I come
here? ...Hmmm.
I don' know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No reason.
I just like to
travel around.
{41_2_0}Nod in {CharName_4}'s direction.
"Hmm..."{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Well, I'll be
going home now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why did you came
here, {CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So that's what
{CharName_7} does.
Does the farm{NextPage_1}make money...?
{41_3_0}Sure.
Not really.
I don't keep track.
----------x----------
...I'm going home
now. Good luck
on the farm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm home! Boy, am I
starving! What's for
dinner, {CharName_25}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing?
Daydreaming?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Darn...I forgot that
I'd left here!{NextPage_49}
When I got hungry
all I could think
about was {CharName_25}'s{NextPage_1}cooking! Oh well,
might as well eat
now...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Darn!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Yeah.
Ah, this letter...
May I...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So this means I
have to find a
job now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Could I work here,
{CharName_24}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Never mind.
Forget I said it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {CharName_0}.
Could I work at
{Location_36_23_128}{_ca}
{41_2_0}Sure.
Not a good idea.
----------x----------
...Never mind.
Forget I said it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess you're
right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
............{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow!
Did you see my
face just now?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I had fun here,
though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm out of money,
so I'll be leaving
soon.{NextPage_49}
No one's looking for
an extra worker
around here, anyway.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks for every-
thing, {CharName_0}...
It was fun.
{41_2_0}So long.
Work with me.
----------x----------
I'll have to stay
here during the
winter anyway.{NextPage_49}
Bye now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks...!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah... Nothing...
I didn't come to see
you or anything...{NextPage_49}
Get to work. Go.
{41_2_0}What is it?
If you say so.
----------x----------
It's really nothing.
I-I'm going home now.
Huh...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really? Cool.
I'll just kick back
and relax then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}What are you
looking at...? Stop
daydreaming! {NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_3}...Bye now!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No one's here. It
should be okay.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Drinking with me
won't be very
much fun, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why did I come
here...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
!
I-I have to get back
now. Bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now you have to
tell me why you
came here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you
doing here,
{CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Never mind.
Forget about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yeah, I knew it.
Never mind!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks for every-
thing, {CharName_0}.
It was fun.
{41_2_0}So long.
Work with me.
----------x----------
I'll have to stay
here during the
winter anyway.{NextPage_49}
I'm sorry about
that time you tried
to give me the{NextPage_1}{13}Blue Feather{17}.
It really did make me
happy, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wait a second.
You see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll do that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good morning,
{CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_24}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you so much
for everything.
Can I come again?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you, too,
{CharName_25}. All the
food was delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm in your
debt, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Bye now!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
!!...Marriage...?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is all kind of
sudden...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey! Don't follow
me, okay?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oky...Yes!
Let's get married.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You care about
paperwork, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was wrong to think
that you had a
girlfriend, right?{NextPage_49}
In that case...
I'd love to
marry you!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And I was planning on
leaving, too...You
have awful timing!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You mean I can
stay here...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Congratulations.{NextPage_49}
I guess I won't be
living here, then.
See ya...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope you're
happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, are
you here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to ask you
something. Do you
have time?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you have a
girlfriend lately?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You see...I...
I'd love to stay in
{Location_43_30_23}.{NextPage_49}
I was wondering if I
can stay with you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can only ask this
of you, but...
What about it?
{41_2_0}Let's live together.
I like living alone.
----------x----------
Really...?
Thank goodness!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
In that case, I have
to go tell {CharName_24}
and {CharName_25}.{NextPage_49}
Thank you so much!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I should have
accepted your
proposal then.{NextPage_49}
Ha ha... Thanks
for everything.
Bye now!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm so relieved
you're here!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm all out of money,
so I have to leave
{Location_43_30_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But, I thought I
might ask you if
I can stay with you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't have to
mind me. Just give
me a roof.
{41_2_0}Sure.
I like living alone.
----------x----------
Really...?
Thank goodness!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
In that case, I have
to go tell {CharName_24}
and {CharName_25}.{NextPage_49}
I can't wait!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you really don't
like me, is that
it...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And I thought it was
such a good idea!{NextPage_49}
What'll I do now?
Oh well, there's
always a way...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And I thought there
was a chance you'd
say yes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's okay, {CharName_24}.
Really...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry. Don't
worry about me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't care,
right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Huh?
...Oh...that{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you know anything
about it, {CharName_24}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Sorry, I didn't
know. I'll accept it
next time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I go back
and tell {CharName_25}
myself?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you satisfied
now, {CharName_24}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I should've accepted
your proposal
back then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see.
Goodbye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, {CharName_24} thinks
it would be a good
idea if I could{NextPage_1}stay with you. I
would be happy if
I could but...{NextPage_1}We don't even know
each other very well,
do we?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Huh? Did I really
say that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you,
{CharName_0}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah... Okay!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You mean it?{NextPage_49}
Thank you, {CharName_0}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I go back
and tell {CharName_25}
myself?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you satisfied
now, {CharName_24}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you, too,
{CharName_0}.{NextPage_49}
I didn't know what
a kind man you were.
Bye now!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry, but I'm not
thinking about
getting married yet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey there.
{41_2_0}Can I sit here?
Let's drink together.
----------x----------
......
{41_2_0}Ask why {CharName_4}'s here
Tell why I'm here
----------x----------
I'm all out of money,
so I think I may have
to leave the{NextPage_1}{Location_43_35_23}, even{NextPage_49}
though I really like
{Location_43_30_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah...Sorry for being
so sudden...
Nice place, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay, I decided...!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come to think of it,
I did turn you down,
didn't I?{NextPage_49}
What an idiot!
Oh well, gotta go
now...Bye!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't worry about it.
That's life.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{41_2_0}Can I sit here?
Let's drink together.
----------x----------
......
{41_2_0}Ask why {CharName_4}'s here.
Tell why I'm here.
----------x----------
Is that so?
Well, good luck!
Bye now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your story?
Sure, I'll listen...
If it's interesting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really do regret
having to leave
{Location_43_30_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I didn't know you
felt that way about
me, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I have to
accept that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why can't we just go
along as before?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll be right
back. {32_3_32}
----------x----------
I heard you're
getting married.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello?
I heard you're
getting married.{NextPage_49}
Hello? Are you
here...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Aren't you the lucky
one to play with
Daddy, {CharName_1}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {2d}...
I want {CharName_1}
to grow up with as{NextPage_1}broad a perspective
as possible, don't
you?
{41_2_0}I agree.
Health comes first.
----------x----------
I guess you're right.
He has to determine
his own path in life.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just as long as he's
healthy, he can
decide everything{NextPage_1}else on his own. {32_3_232}
I shouldn't worry too
much, eh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Time for bed,
{CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh yeah, I forgot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {2b_2} is
almost out of food.
Will you restock it?{NextPage_49}
Thanks. Good night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} just
went to bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think {CharName_1}
might become a good
farmer. Today...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today he went into
the tool shed, and
I followed him.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

  ♪La-la-laaa...♪{NextPage_0}

♪La-la-la♪
  ♪La-la-laaa...♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}That's a good boy,
{CharName_1}. Just wait
a little longer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That was great,
{CharName_1}! {NextPage_49}
Sing it for your
father, too!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {2d}!{NextPage_49}
{CharName_1} has become
a great singer!{NextPage_49}
When I sing, he
copies me perfectly!
He must be a prodigy!
{41_2_0}Right on!
Too young to tell.
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}I can't wait
until he becomes
a star!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}Hmm...{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_26}Maybe I'm just
being too emotional.{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_3}Still, I'm going
to encourage him
all I can!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
Yaaawn....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good morning.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Moroning!
You're up early,
{2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Time to wake up,
{CharName_1}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to bed
now, {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Time for bed,
{CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If a ghost comes in,
don't come running
to me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay, let's go
to bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_0}Everybody doesn't
have to get so
excited!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}Please don't
make such a big
fuss...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_0}Ahh...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_25}I just wanted to
eat some more of
{CharName_25}'s cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Thanks again,
{CharName_24}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_0}So, I guess...I {32_3_232}
I'll be here
a little longer...
{41_2_0}As long as you like.
Everyone'll be happy.
----------x----------
{50_4_0_26}Ha ha... Thanks...{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_0}...
{50_4_0_3}Hmm...I'll think
about it.{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_0}Well... {32_3_232}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10} ...Thanks.{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_0} ...
{50_4_0_3}I guess I just
like it here.{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_0} Well... {32_3_232}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {CharName_1}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}I guess I'll have
to go look for him...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_0}{2d}!
{CharName_1} hasn't
come home, so I'm{NextPage_1}going out to look
for him!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_0}Is it already
that late...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}I'm going to go
look around...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_0}It's already
bedtime!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_1}I'm just glad
you're okay.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's go to bed
now, {CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if
{CharName_1} is
asleep yet...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome back.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} just went
to bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He's been watching
a lot of TV lately.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if he's
interested in farm
work?{NextPage_49}
He gets so serious
when he watches the
farming programs!{NextPage_49}
What do you think,
{2d}?
{41_2_0}You must be right!
I don't think so.
----------x----------
I knew it.
I bet soon he'll want
to start helping out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_26}Maybe you're
right, but I bet he
will still want to{NextPage_1}help out eventually.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_1}♪A necklace of...♪
♪White floweeers...♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_1}♪The necklace...♪
♪You gave me...♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a good
{CharName_1}. Wait just
a little longer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a good boy!
Sing that song
for Daddy★{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {2d}!
{CharName_1} has turned
into a great singer!{NextPage_49}
He repeats songs
right after I do!{NextPage_49}
I think he's got
a talent!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure he does!
He could be a star!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}You're right...{32_3_232}
{50_4_0_26}I'm getting too
excited, aren't I?{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_3}But I still think we
should encourage him,
don't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}What are you
drawing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}...Daddy???{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_25}It...looks just
like him...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} drew this.
What do you think
it is?
{41_3_0}A flower.
Me, of course.
I don't know.
----------x----------
That's right. It's
a flower. Don't you
think it's good?{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_3}I think he
has real talent...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}Honestly? Hmm...{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_3}I think he
has real talent...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really? It looks
like a flower to me,
but {CharName_1} says {NextPage_1}its his Daddy!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe {CharName_1}
has hidden talent!{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_3}He could even be a
genius...What do you
think?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}What are you doing,
honey?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}What a good job
you're doing♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't you think
{CharName_1} has good hand
eye coordination?
{41_2_0}Really?
Of course he does!
----------x----------
He loves to jump and
play. Maybe he'll be
a sports star...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He is your son,
after all!{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_3}I can't wait until
he grows up and
becomes famous!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know, {2d},
{CharName_1} loves
to read.{NextPage_49}
Even just the other
day, he was...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}...What
book are you reading,
{CharName_1}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {CharName_1}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}I'm going to go
make dinner now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you reading
again, {CharName_1}{NextPage_128}{_ca}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}You're so smart,
my little sweetie!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}'s so smart,
I bet he'll win the
Nobel Prize when he{NextPage_1}grows up!
{41_2_0}I bet you're right.
Don't be silly!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}I'm sure he'll
be a famous
professor!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}Ha ha ha...I guess
you're right.{NextPage_49}
I still think we
should encourage him,
though!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Umm...I hate to stick
my nose into farm
business, but is{NextPage_1}everything going
alright?{NextPage_49}
{CharName_7} says your
shipments are pretty
low lately...
{41_2_0}I'll try harder.
Who cares?
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}Are you serious?
{41_2_0}Just kidding!
You bet I am.
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}You must be joking!?
{41_2_0}I am. Don't worry.
Not at all!
----------x----------
{50_4_0_4}You really don't care
about the farm?!
{41_2_0}Sorry for the joke.
Yep, that's right.
----------x----------
{50_4_0_1}Ahh, I feel
better now!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}Don't joke like that!
{50_4_0_1}I'm glad, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, it's your farm!{NextPage_49}
Just don't make
trouble for
{CharName_7}, okay?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_30}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_30}......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_30}..........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_7}Okay, I give up.
Do whatever you want!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard a beautiful
voice...Is that
{CharName_20}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wait...Was it
{CharName_1}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {2d}, I
I think {CharName_1}
may be musically{NextPage_1}inclined.
Even {CharName_20}
praised him.{NextPage_49}
What do you think?
{41_2_0}I agree.
I doubt it.
----------x----------
I'm glad you have to
think so too!{NextPage_49}
It's great to have
a talented son...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure he'll become
a famous musician!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe you're right,
and I am getting
too excited...{NextPage_49}
I do think we
should encourage
him, though!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He could become a
great singer!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if {CharName_1}
has the makings of
an artist...{NextPage_49}
What do you think?
{41_2_0}I think he does.
Too young to tell.
----------x----------
If {CharName_21} says so,
then it must be true!{NextPage_49}
When he gets older,
{CharName_1} might start
making art {NextPage_1}of his own!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're right - It is
too early to know.{NextPage_49}
If {CharName_21} says so,
though, we should
encourage him.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh! Geeeez...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Of course he
couldn't win against
{CharName_13}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} is a really
fast runner, {2d}.{NextPage_49}
Even {CharName_11} said so.
Do you think he could
be an athlete?
{41_2_0}Maybe he could.
I doubt it.
----------x----------
He could be a
marathon runner when
he grows up!{NextPage_49}
{CharName_13}'s rival,
even...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're probably
right...{NextPage_49}
I still think we
should encourage him,
though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know that
scholar wanted
{CharName_1} for an{NextPage_1}assistant? I think
he might be the
academic type.{NextPage_49}
What do you think?
{41_2_0}I think so, too.
Nah, I doubt it.
----------x----------
Yes, our {CharName_1}
will probably grow up
to be a scholar...!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess you're
right. He's still a
child, after all...{NextPage_49}
I still think we
should encourage him,
though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}... I'm kind
of worried about
the farm lately.{NextPage_49}
I don't mean to
intrude, but...Is the
farm doing okay?
{41_2_0}I'll try harder.
I hate farming.
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}Are you serious?
{41_2_0}Just kidding!
You bet I am.
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}You can't be serious!
{41_2_0}I'm not. Don't worry.
But I am!
----------x----------
{50_4_0_4}You really don't care
about the farm?!
{41_2_0}Sorry for the joke.
Yep, that's right.
----------x----------
I feel better now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}Don't joke like that!
{50_4_0_1}I do feel better
now, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}Now that {CharName_1}
is older, I wanted to
build on the house.{NextPage_49}
Now I feel more
confident about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_30}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_30}.......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_30}............{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}...OK, I give up.
Do whatever you want!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} can do as
he wants, but... {32_3_232}
----------x----------
I have feelings
too, you know! {32_3_232}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_7}Ahhh... {32_3_232}{50_4_0_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you
reading...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you want
a snack...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's up?
Is everything okay?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Go ask your father.
He'd be glad to
teach you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see what you mean. {32_3_232}
I'll go ask him
first for you, okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi, {2d}.
About {CharName_1}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He's so interested in
the farm lately.{NextPage_49}
If he comes and
asks you, will you
teach him about it?{NextPage_49}
{41_2_0}Of course.
I'm too busy.
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}Good.
Thank you, honey.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't understand
much about men, but
I think {CharName_1}{NextPage_1}wants to become a
farmer like you,
{2d}.{NextPage_49}
Can't you just tell
him to watch? {52_0_0_0}
{39_1}For me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {2d}.
About {CharName_1}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if he's
interested in farm
work at all...
{41_2_0}I doubt it.
He might be.
----------x----------
I think you're right.
Whatever it is,
he should decide{NextPage_1}what he likes and
live his own life.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm...If you think
so, {2d}.{NextPage_49}
If he isn't,
though, he should do
whatever he likes.{NextPage_49}
Don't you agree?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How is the farm
these days?
{41_2_0}Just fine.
Not so great.
----------x----------
Really? {50_4_0_35}
If you say so...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...{32_7_208}
{50_4_0_9}{CharName_1} is growing
up and everything...{NextPage_49}
It would be nice if
you tried a little
harder, but if you{NextPage_1}really don't want to,
I suppose we can
manage...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Music is fine,
but you should help
your father out, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Art is fine,
but you should help
your father out, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sports are fine,
but you should help
your father out, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Studying is fine,
but you should help
your father out, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm glad you like
helping out on the
farm, but you should{NextPage_1}try to expand your
horizons some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}{CharName_1} isn't
back yet.{NextPage_49}
What's he doing out
so late...?
{41_2_0}I'll go look.
He's grown up now.
----------x----------
I know, but I can't
help but worry. Won't
you look for him?
{41_2_0}If you want me to.
He's fine, I'm sure.
----------x----------
Thanks so much...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So he was listening
to {CharName_27} play,
was he?{NextPage_49}
That's fine, but
I worry when he
stays out so late!{NextPage_49}
...I wonder if he has
the makings of a
musician...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay, if you say
so...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Look, he's back! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where were you,
young man?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, wait...!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So he was listening
to {CharName_27} play,
was he?{NextPage_49}
I worry when he
stays out so late!{NextPage_49}
...I wonder if he has
the makings of a
musician...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I ask a
funny question?
{41_2_0}Nope.
Sure.
----------x----------
Come on....
Please...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can a round
object look square?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Huh???
Of course not!
----------x----------
I don't understand
either...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you can't figure
it out either...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} asked me
the same thing
all the sudden.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Huh?
What did you say?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...What do you mean?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmmm...
It's kind of
complicated...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...That's the story.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet he's going to
be an artist... {NextPage_49}
He has such an
artistic way of
looking at things...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay...
What should I do?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ready?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
On your marks...
GO!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Go {CharName_1} !{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Finished!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_13} sure is fast!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}{CharName_1} isn't
back yet.{NextPage_49}
What's he doing out
so late...?
{41_2_0}I'll go look.
He's grown up now.
----------x----------
I know, but I can't
help but worry. Won't
you look for him?
{41_2_0}If you want me to.
He's fine, I'm sure.
----------x----------
Thanks so much...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So he was listening
to {CharName_19} talk
was he?{NextPage_49}
That's fine, but
I worry when he
stays out so late!{NextPage_49}
...I wonder if he has
the makings of a
scholar...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know what you
mean, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Look, he's back!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where were you,
young man?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, wait...!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So he was listening
to {CharName_19} talk
was he?{NextPage_49}
That's fine, but
I worry when he
stays out so late!{NextPage_49}
...I wonder if he has
the makings of a
scholar...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was just curious,
that's all...{NextPage_49}
Before you were born,
in the spring,
{CharName_7} came here{NextPage_1}with your father.
He had come once
before...{NextPage_1}with someone else...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
According to
{CharName_7}, that person
was your father's{NextPage_1}father.
So, your grandfather.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know any-
thing else, though. {NextPage_49}
{CharName_7} won't tell
me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your father doesn't
like to talk about
it, either.{NextPage_49}
He just says he took
over the farm
because his father{NextPage_1}wanted him to.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Really?
I'm sure that'll make
your father happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...I didn't mean to
make {CharName_0}
worry!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Well then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi, {CharName_0}.
What are you
doing here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm starving!
What's to eat,
{CharName_25}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why is everybody
so gloomy today?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you think,
{CharName_1}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you think so,
then she probably
does too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes you just
have to let things
work out...{NextPage_49}
But don't forget to
try first.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, {32_1_244}good luck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you
looking at,
{2d}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What, are you
thinking about
something...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...It's been a long
time since then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Our son has grown up,
and we've grown
old, too...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your hair is all
gray and your face
is all wrinkly...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...What?
{41_2_0}You're wrinkly too.
You're still pretty.
----------x----------
{50_4_0_4}How rude...{32_11_184}
{50_4_0_3}But...I guess we're
both old fogies now!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_13}Oh, I know
you don't really
think so...{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_26}But, thanks...
Hee hee...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We've still got a
lot ahead of us,
though!{NextPage_49}
{CharName_7} is still
working hard too,
you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
{2d}....
What's wrong...?{NextPage_49}
..................!?
{2d}!....{2d}!!{NextPage_49}
{CharName_1}!
Get {CharName_31}! Quickly!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hang in there,
{2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's wrong...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't believe
this...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Just like that...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Will you play a song
for {CharName_0} in
heaven, {CharName_27}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think I'll have
a look.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you have
to sell?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey. Are you
listening?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, I'm talking
to you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}{34_1_123}I see you
don't have anything
to sell.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}{34_1_123}Why bother having
a store at all?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll come back when
you have something
to sell.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you have some-
thing interesting,
I'll buy it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if there's
anything good
here...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want to buy
something, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think I'll come
back another day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How much is that
{29_0}?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
Not for sale.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}Can't you make it
any cheaper than
that?{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_0}I guess I'll
take it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Naww...I change my
mind. I don't
need it. Bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a little much,
but I'll take it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now I want it
more than ever!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't need to
buy any more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}...............{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}Did you eat something
funny...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_26}What? Why are you
following me like
a dog?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}............{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}I wonder if you
ate something funny.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_4}..................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_125}...What?
Oh, good morning.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't be so eager
just to say hi.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_125}There are always
people like you about
at this hour.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't believe you
coming around at
this hour!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm staying here.
What are you
doing here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_125}Do you come
here often? Really?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_125}What a coincidence.
...I was hoping to
relax by myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that?
{41_2_0}Try it.
Looks good, huh?
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Sure, I'll try it.
{34_1_123}You're kind of a
strange guy, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It doesn't matter
what I think,
does it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
....
I'll ask {CharName_25} to
fix me something...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks great.
{41_2_0}It's yours then.
Doesn't it?
----------x----------
I didn't say I wanted
it, but hey, if you
insist.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's not like I want
it or anything.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that a little
odd looking? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Man, that looks
absolutely inedible.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't think that's
even edible...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You really are weird
for liking that,
dude.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay, okay.
You keep it for
yourself, okay?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't wait to watch
him grow up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet he'll grow up
to love farming.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't wait to watch
him grow up!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope he takes after
{CharName_3}. She's
funny, you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a herding
dog?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That one looks more
like a pet than a
working dog...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}What a cute cat!
{34_1_123}I love cats.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cats just use you
for food, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that your
chicken?
How interesting!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like his red comb!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}How cuuute!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Little birds are so
much fun to pet!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Wow!
A real live duck!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is this a duck?
He's so small!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're keeping a
wild duck...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The ones with big
bumps on their
bills are geese.{NextPage_49}
I don't think there
are any around
here, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of seed
is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is it going to grow
into a big tree, or
just a plant?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you grow that?
How great!
{41_2_0}You can have it.
You can buy it.
----------x----------
Thanks a lot.
You're swell.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Are you trying
to advertise or
something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I might buy it if
it's something I've
never had before.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Milk, eh? I've
milked a cow once
before, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Wow, cheese?
Sniff sniff...
{34_1_123}Smells pretty good!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear that cheese
from different kinds
of cows tastes{NextPage_1}different too.
How neat!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Butter, eh?
Did you make it
yourself from milk?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The taste of the
butter depends on
the milk, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Shells of good eggs
are hard, since they
have so much{NextPage_1}nutrition in them.
Neat, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be careful not to
give your chickens
stress.{NextPage_49}
I hate stress
myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}You caught that
yourself, did you?
How great!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love to catch fish
and eat it right
then.{NextPage_49}
Why are you carrying
that one around?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are those wild
plants? I bet those
are good to cook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Location_43_30_23}
has some unique
plants, I hear.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that?
{41_2_0}Try it.
It's very good.
----------x----------
{34_1_124}...Me?
{50_4_0_10}Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you go home
and eat it
yourself?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a hoe, right?
Haven't seen that
kind before.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How is it different
from a regular one?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}Now what could
that be?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you like walking
around with things
like that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}{34_1_123}You are so proud
of your new hoe that
you like carrying it{NextPage_1}around with you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't just show it
to us - use it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can tell you've
been using that
hoe a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going
excavating?{NextPage_49}
Show me if you
find something
interesting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now that is the
oldest hoe I've
ever seen!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just as long as it
works, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a sickle?
What an odd one.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a sickle?
{34_1_123}What a funny
looking sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a new sickle?
You must really like
farming!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing
carrying around some-
thing like that for?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks like an
antique. How long've
you been using it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't point that
at me. Geeez...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_124}I hope you aren't
expecting me to water
anything for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't worry about me.{NextPage_49}
I go to the
{Location_43_33_23}
when I get thirsty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a milking
machine?
{34_1_123}Neat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet you can get a
lot with that
contraption.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you use those to
shear sheep?
Looks hard...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet it takes
a long time, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You use those for
shearing sheep,
don't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They look like you
can use them for
humans too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got a nice
tool there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with
everything.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you find this in
{Location_43_30_23}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looking at this makes
me remember my
childhood.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You sure did find
some neat things...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe they're worth
a lot of money...!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Could you live
off of plants
like that...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looks very good
for you, but...
Blech!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Wow! A record!
Do you have a player?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish we had a
record player at
the {Location_43_35_23}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you get those
spices from
{CharName_25}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_25} makes her
own spices, you
know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}{50_4_0_10}What a nice
sound that is...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}I could listen to
that sound for
hours...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you get that
medal from
{CharName_11}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't believe any-
one would give away
their own medal!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you find that
necklace at the
{Location_43_41_23}?{NextPage_49}
{34_1_123}Pretty fascinating,
isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It could even be
cursed or
something...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You got that music
from {CharName_9}, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You sure do have
a lot of stuff...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}{34_1_123}Ha ha ha...!
Someone gave you
fireworks?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Never heard of
anyone giving a big
firework as a gift.{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_3}You sure do
have guts...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what you
have in your
rucksack...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I look inside
your rucksack
sometime?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
People ask me all the
time why I'm
traveling...{NextPage_49}
But, I don't have
a specific reason
to tell them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I never forget people
who are kind to me.{NextPage_49}
You too... What was
your name again...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes I just get
the urge to go
someplace new.{NextPage_49}
That's all I can say.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't imagine
owning my own land
like you do...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A long time ago I
met a man named Aja
in a town far away.{NextPage_49}
She was so kind...
I wonder what she's
doing now...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you
gave me was better
than I expected.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That {29_0}?
I gave it to {CharName_25}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks for the
{29_0} you
gave me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I asked {CharName_25} to
make something with
the {29_0} you{NextPage_1}gave me.
{50_4_0_10}Everyone liked it.
{34_1_123}Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}The {29_0} you
gave me was really
delicious. Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I enjoyed the
{29_0} you
gave me.{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_10}You're a good cook,
you know that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I ate that
{29_0}.{NextPage_49}
If you make it again
let me know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I gave that
{29_0} I got
from you to {CharName_26}.{NextPage_49}
She was looking at
it intensely, so...
I think she likes it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're doing an
excellent job on
the farm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know how
you make your crops
taste so good.{NextPage_49}
Eating them makes
me happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your cooking really
is good.{NextPage_49}
You should consider
a career switch.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Almost everybody does
the same thing day
in and day out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That makes them
feel safer, I guess.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like the people at
the {Location_43_33_23}.{NextPage_49}
They're all so
honest about
themselves.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Children should be
protected from
certain things.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You look like you
have lots of free
time, man.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Not that there's
anything wrong with
that...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't feel like
talking to people
now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}Hey, you talk
too much, man.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everyone seems to
get so much happier
in the spring.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't believe I
stayed here
the whole year...{NextPage_49}
And I was going
to leave much sooner.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}Boy do I
hate the summer
heat...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}Don't you
have to work
or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A woman's heart is as
unpredictable as the
autumn weather in{NextPage_1}Forget-Me-Not Valley.
You know want I
mean?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The wind sure is
brisk. If you don't
take care, you can{NextPage_1}catch colds just as
easily in fall,
you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what it
feels like to sleep
the whole winter.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish I could ski
in this valley...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you know what's
on the other side of
the sea?{NextPage_49}
I love to
imagine...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can almost
imagine this is the
edge of the world...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}Geeez, I don't like
be bothered when I'm
here...{NextPage_49}
But I guess you're
okay...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Listening to the
forest was just
getting interesting.{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
If you listen
carefully, you'd be
surprised at what{NextPage_1}you can hear.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where should I
go next...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you still care
about that thing...?
I don't at all.{NextPage_49}
Life's too short
to worry about
things like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't get too close.
I don't want people
to get the wrong{NextPage_1}idea about us.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't believe we're
getting married.{NextPage_49}
That's just too
bizarre!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_123}If this is a dream,
I'm ready to wake up.{NextPage_49}
I've had enough
fun already.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's up?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was just thinking.
I've been all over,
but this might be{NextPage_1}as good a place as
any for settling
down.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_123}Thanks for
everything.{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_10}I'm so glad you
are here for me!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you a good cook? {NextPage_49}
If we're going to
live together,
I sure hope you are!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry, but I'm busy
right now. Can you
come back later?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry, but
thanks anyway.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Time for bed...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to go to
sleep, so will you
leave?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to leave,
so...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to go out,
so you do too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Bye now...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} likes
taking a bath with
Daddy♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All clean now!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't cry, {CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
