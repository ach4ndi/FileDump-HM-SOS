{34_1_106}Oh, it's you. {NextPage_49}
I was so involved in
work, I hadn't
noticed you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I won't bother you...{NextPage_49}
{50_14_0_3}I get some good
ideas by looking at
you. Thanks. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Perfect timing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks to you I was
able to finish my
piece, so consider{NextPage_1}this a gift from me
to you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They'll never be
another made,
so treasure it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_0}......{32_7_208}{NextPage_49}
{50_21_0_4}That person...
Was so special... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_4}{36_1}Where did you see it?{36_0}{32_5_220}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_105}I don't like the way
this one turned out... {NextPage_49}
I might be able to
fix it if I do
this... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_106}I guess that's an
okay shape... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your Dad came to
pick you up, so
go home. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your son has a good
sense to him. {NextPage_49}
He can really tell
the difference
between shapes. {NextPage_49}
Cultivate that
ability in him. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All mankind returns
to the earth... {32_7_208}{NextPage_1}But I am sad I'll
never see you again
my friend... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, sing
something in his
honor... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_106}Oh, it's you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You came at just
the right time. {NextPage_49}
I made something
for your room.
Is it a big room? {32_3_232}
{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Then everything
will be okay. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought as much,
that's why I made
it small. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was thinking of
just bringing it
to you... {32_3_232}
{41_2_0}That's fine.
Hold on a second.
----------x----------
Shall we get
going? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No waiting.
Let's get
going... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where would you
like to put it? {32_3_232}
{41_2_0}{2b_16}
{2b_18}
----------x----------
You got it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You got it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is perfect. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}What do you think? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Guess I'll be
heading back... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm gonna hit the
sack soon... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You mind going home?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See ya...
G'night. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've gotta be
on my way... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I need to get
out of here.
So long.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Later... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, excuse me... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_105}It doesn't
look like you have
anything for sale. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess there's
nothing for me to
buy today... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't you have
anything to sell? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm just taking
a look. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's nothing
good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like that
{29_0},
but how much is it?
{41_3_2}It's only {2a_1_5}G.
{2a_2_5}G.
Not for sale.
----------x----------
Oh, I'll take
it then. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's fine.
I'll take it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Say what?
Okay, guess I won't
be buying it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How much is that
{29_0}?
{41_3_2}It's only {2a_1_5}.
{2a_1_5}G.
Not for sale.
----------x----------
Forget it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm a metallurgist.
Nice to meet you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're the farm
owner, right?
{CharName_128}{NextPage_1}Nice to meet you... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_106}Yes...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing
out tonight? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_107}Sweet.
Is that for me? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}Thanks a bunch! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks really
good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_107}That's some food
you've got there. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't stand
that junk. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't want
that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_106}What is THAT? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}He's cute. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He's got a cute
face. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He looks like he'll
grow up to be
mischievous. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}He looks just like
Nami... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nami's kid just
has to be cute. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why hello doggy!
How are you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take good care of
him. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a cute
looking cat. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay cat.
That's enough
of you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hate chickens. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a cute
little chick. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He's cute but...
I still don't
like chickens. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay chicken.
That's enough
of you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's gotten an
interesting face...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what it's
thinking right now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know one
seed from another. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Aren't seeds your
department?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You grew that? {NextPage_49}
I'll gladly
receive that gift
from the Earth. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}Can I have it? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}That's great. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_105}I see... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's great to be
able to grow crops
in the Earth... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Fresh milk is always
the best. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Fresh milk tastes
so good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that
cheese on your
farm? {NextPage_49}
It looks really
delicious... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Rich cheese tastes
the best. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that
butter on your farm?{NextPage_49}
It looks really
delicious... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Tasty butter always
smells a little
different. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't drop it... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you catch that
fish, man? {NextPage_1}Not bad... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a beautiful
fish. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The wild plants
that grow around
here are tasty. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_106}Why don't you
eat it and see
for yourself? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You cooked that?
It looks good... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks mighty
tasty... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's some very
tasty looking food. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an unusual
looking hoe.
It looks heavy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a very rare
looking hoe. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe's got a
lot of years on it. {NextPage_49}
Can you even use it
anymore? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a dirty
looking hoe. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a brand new
looking hoe. {NextPage_49}
You've got to
use it more... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe has barely
even been used. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The more you use a
hoe, the more you
it adjusts to you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where are you going
with that hoe? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that yours?
You must have been
using it a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe looks easy
to use. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an unusual
looking sickle. {NextPage_49}
It looks hard to
maneuver... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Strange looking
sickle. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That sickle looks
really sharp. {NextPage_49}
Don't be spinning
it around in here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a strange
looking sickle. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that yours?
You've got to break
that in more. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a brand new
looking sickle. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The more you use a
sickle, the more it
will adjust to you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't go wandering
around randomly
carrying a sickle. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's some sickle
you've got there,
man.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That sickle has
been used a lot. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?
Did you decide to
create too? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's got a good
shape to it... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't need
a watering can. {NextPage_49}
I'm not the type
to go carrying
water around... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Watering somewhere
are you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_105}That's a weird
looking machine... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't like the
shape that has. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
These shears make
me feel all
nostalgic. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_4}Keep those away
from my head! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are some
big shears. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_106}What the heck
is that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I try not to use
tools when I'm
creating art. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an unusual
stone... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty
stone... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a bizarre
looking thing... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you going
to do with that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The plants around
here seem to have
some special {NextPage_1}properties to
them. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are plants
from around here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a record? {NextPage_49}
You really do have
all sorts of rare
items! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm a music lover
too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's got some
smell to it... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}{34_1_107}That's a weird
little drum... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}{50_21_0_3}That makes a good
sound. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a strange
necklace. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty
necklace. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's one of the
old man's fireworks. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where are you going
to shoot that off? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't dropt that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've been to a lot
of places, but it's
most peaceful here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't talk much.{NextPage_49}
Don't take that
personally or
anything... {NextPage_49}
I'm just not big
on words... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's the best
feeling in the world
to create something {NextPage_1}without tools and
just feel yourself
melt into nature. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer in
Mineral Town is
a rich guy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer in
Mineral Town is
very popular. {NextPage_49}
That's probably
cause he talks
a lot with people. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's some farmer
who can grow any
type of crop... {NextPage_49}
That's what I
heard over in
Mineral Town... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer in
Mineral Town is
a nice guy. {NextPage_49}
He really takes
good care of his
animals. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer in
Mineral Town is
always mining. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer in
Mineral Town is
a great fisherman. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer in
Mineral Town walks
around a lot. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer in Mineral
Town has been working
over 50 years...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer in
Mineral Town ignores
his farm duties {NextPage_1}and just goes out
and fishes all
day long. {NextPage_49}
What a fool. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer in
Mineral Town has
no taste. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farmer in
Mineral Town owns
many houses... {NextPage_49}
I wonder what's
so fun about that... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's an amazing
blacksmith in
Mineral Town. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}The food you gave
me last time was
really good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The food you gave me
last time was...
Well... {NextPage_49}
Not so good... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you
gave me last time
was really good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you
gave me last time
was delicious! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}The {29_0} you
gave me last time
was the best I {NextPage_1}have ever eaten
in my life! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}The {29_0} you
gave me last time
was my favorite. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The cheese you
gave me last time
was really good. {NextPage_49}
So rich and
creamy... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The cheese you
gave me last time
smelled a little. {NextPage_49}
Still, that's
my kind of cheese! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The cheese you
gave me last time
was spectacular. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}The butter you
gave me last time
was great. {NextPage_49}
So rich and
creamy... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The butter you
gave me last time
smelled a little. {NextPage_49}
Still, that's my
kind of butter! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The butter you
gave me last time
was really tasty! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}The {29_0} you gave
me last time was
delicious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The dish you gave
me before was
very tasty. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The fish you gave
me before was tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The wild plants
you gave me before
tasted good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The wild plants you
brought me before
were great. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The stuff you gave
me last time...
It was good... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looks like you've
been working hard. {NextPage_49}
You can see it the
satisfaction in
your face. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looks like you've
been working hard. {NextPage_49}
It's like you've
had a breakthrough
of sorts. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looks like you're
getting used to life
on the farm. {NextPage_49}
You've calmed
down a little. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you think
of my work?
{41_3_1}It's pretty.
I guess I like it.
I have no clue.
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}{34_1_105}Ah, so you think
it's pretty, do you?
So do I. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}I'm happy to hear
you say that... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_105}Well, you and I
may just see things
differently. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not too good
with people. {NextPage_49}
Don't take it
personally. {NextPage_49}
It's just my
personality. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The natural element
of Forget-Me-Not
Valley mixes well{NextPage_1}with my type of
artwork.{NextPage_49}
Wait a minute,
that's the other way
around. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_21_0_3}I'm feeling good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How are you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_106}What's going on? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You need something? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel so calm
when I come here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_105}I'm feeling good... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today my head is
filled with ideas
of new work. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_105}Hmmm...nothing really
catches my interest. {NextPage_49}
Something
feels different... {NextPage_49}
I can't put my
finger on it... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You should always
be feeling something
from nature... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The valley fills me
with such great
images but I'm not {NextPage_1}able to express them
appropriately yet. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_105}I get the feeling
something important
is liking... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_106}How are you feeling
today? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can feel things
from the objects
you see and the {NextPage_1}sounds that you hear.
You understand? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nature changes with
the seasons but my
work is constant. {NextPage_49}
Maybe that's a
problem... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I need more
time... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I get the
inspiration for a
piece of art, {NextPage_1}I feel the image
and shape hammer
itself into me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This piece has yet
to feel the touch
of nature. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The ocean absorbs
everything... {NextPage_49}
The way people
feel, and their
senses melt away {NextPage_1}before the greatness
of the ocean. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's nice when the
sea is calm, but
it's better when {NextPage_1}a mighty storm
rages around
inside it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nothing can stop the
flow of the river. {NextPage_49}
You can forget even
the flow of time at
the river, however,{NextPage_1}like the river,
nothing can stop
time's flow. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_105}If you stare too
long at the river,
you'll get tired. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can feel the
energies of the
trees in the forest. {NextPage_49}
It's like they're
entering my body. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_105}I feel like I could
get swallowed by
the forest... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can get strength
from a waterfall. {NextPage_49}
You can feel the
immense power of
water around you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll never ever
get tired of the
valley. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm... I've changed
my mind.
Maybe later. {NextPage_0}
