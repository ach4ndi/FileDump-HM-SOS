Oh, hey
{2d}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How's work? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What? You've got
nothing to sell?
Hmmm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you play with
everyone like that?{NextPage_49}
I guess it's fun to
watch what happens...
Ha ha.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You sold everything
today? {NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_10}Will we be
celebrating tonight? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why are you here? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, there's still
some left? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}I know!
Sell the things I
don't like. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It would be nice
if you sell more
things. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you selling?
{41_2_0}Yeah!
Nope.
----------x----------
Hmmmm. Really?
Well, keep it up. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}{34_1_123}Hee hee hee...
Nothing at all?
That's pretty bad.{NextPage_49}
Well, don't worry.
People will come. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}Huh...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}I felt really
exhausted yesterday.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}I just feel so
down. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I should just
take it easy
today... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}Huh...
There's nothing fun
to do around here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}I don't even want
to go out and look
for anything to do. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}This is so not like
me... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}Sorry...
Could we do
something fun? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Guess I'll take
a day off today. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good morning... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
............
Morning...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay, that's
enough already. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Off to work with
you now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi {2d}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {2d}.
Did you have a hard
day today? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome home after
your hard day's
work. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing
up at this hour? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My son's sleeping
well as always.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not doing
anything really.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't wait up
for me to go to bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm fine.
I'll sleep when I
feel tired. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can go to
sleep first, it's
okay. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {2d}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What!?
It's already that
time? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, are you hungry?
Go pick some of the
things over there. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d} what
are you up to? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just a little is
fine. {NextPage_49}
I'm going home
anyway... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm worried about
our son. {NextPage_49}
{2d}, you can
go home ahead of me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {2d},
what're you up to? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}That's great.
I was just thinking
of eating that.
{41_3_0}Give.
Don't give.
Sell.
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}Thank you!
Hee hee...※{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}You're just
teasing me?
Ohhh... {NextPage_49}
My stomach is SO
empty. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}How could you be
so cheap? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks so
delicious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's nice.
{41_3_0}Give.
Don't Give.
Sell.
----------x----------
For me? {32_1_244}
{50_4_0_3}Oh thank you! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Show me it again. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm, never mind...
I don't want it
enough to buy it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks for showing
that to me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}Um, you weren't
going to serve that
at dinner were you?{NextPage_49}
Please anything
but that!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}Oh, goodness.
I can't stand that!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}Um, what's that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}No no no...
Really I don't
need to see that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Go play with Daddy,
baby. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Grow big and strong! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Are you making
faces? Silly boy. {NextPage_1}Why you look just
like {2d}! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He loves being held. {NextPage_49}
You don't think
he's becoming a
Momma's boy, do you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey {23}.
Are you hungry? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, you
really love {23},
don't you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Here kitty kitty.
Huh... {NextPage_49}
Why don't you ever
let me hold you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, you
really love cats,
don't you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh!!
I thought chickens
could fly away. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know, speaking
of chickens... {NextPage_49}
Our son chases
them often. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lay some delicious
eggs, okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that if you
raise your chicken
with great care, {NextPage_49}
someday it may start
laying golden eggs. {NextPage_49}
At least that's
what {CharName_25}
told me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay, enough.
Let it go. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's so tiny.
Don't go getting
lost now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They could get
stepped on
accidentally. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't you think
{23} might eat
them accidentally? {NextPage_49}
Are you sure
they'll be okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}{34_1_123}Tee hee hee...
This is a strange
one... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}Look at the duck's
bill. Ha ha ha! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_26}Aww, looks angry.
Does that duck know
I was laughing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}{34_1_123}Ha ha ha.
It makes the same
face as the parent. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}Look at the duck's
bill. Ha ha ha!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_26}Aww, looks angry.
Does that duck know
I was laughing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, what type of
seed is that? {NextPage_49}
Are you going to
plant that now? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why not try planting
that seed? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, crops.
Looks like they
came out nice. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hope you can sell
them for a good
price. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What? Oh, ah...
Good job. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oooh, Milk.
It looks delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Milk always tastes
better from animals
that you pet. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm grateful to
our cows! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be careful not to
spill it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's some
delicious looking
cheese. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What? Oh, ah...
Good job.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter looks
delicious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What? Oh, ah...
Good job.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that tomorrow's
breakfast? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's an important
source of protein. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}You did it! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's eat it while
it's fresh. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Bring back more
fish next time
you go out. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, wild grasses. {NextPage_1}Is that for today's
dinner? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We're never at a
loss for food here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks great.
Did you make that,
{2d}?
{41_2_0}Try it.
Looks good, right?
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Are you sure?
Okay, here goes. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}Are you going to eat
it all yourself...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A hoe...
Planning on doing
some cultivating? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck tilling
the soil. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A hoe...
Planning on doing
some cultivating? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck tilling
the soil. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you got a
new hoe.
That's great. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck tilling
the soil. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A hoe...
Planning on doing
some cultivating? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck tilling
the soil. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
You want a new hoe? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck tilling
the soil. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A sickle...
Are you going to
cut something? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck reaping. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A sickle...
Planning on cutting
anything down? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do your best! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ooh, a new sickle.
That's great. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do your best. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A sickle...
Are you going to
cut something? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck reaping. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
You want a new
sickle? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck reaping. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A watering can...
You're going to
water the plants? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Give them plenty of
water. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, it's a new
watering can.
That's great. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Give them plenty of
water. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A watering can. {NextPage_49}
Oh, you're going
to water the
plants? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Give them plenty of
water. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
You want a new
watering can?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Give them plenty of
water. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, it's a new
milker.
That's great. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope you can get
a lot of good
milk with it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A milker huh?
That's interesting. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope you can get
a lot of good
milk with it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I might even help
you milk now. {NextPage_49}
But, I'll probably
get tired of it
after awhile. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You want a new
milker? {NextPage_49}
Well, I guess the
cow could use
one too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope you can get
a lot of good
milk with it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ooh, clippers.
You can cut hair
with those. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck shearing
the sheep. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nice new clippers.
I'm sure the sheep
will be happy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck shearing
the sheep. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm, clippers.
They're for shearing
sheep. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck shearing
the sheep. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, those clippers
have been used to
death. {NextPage_49}
Can they still
make a clean cut? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck shearing
the sheep. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You bought a new
tool?
That's great. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, go do your
best. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's up?
That really suits
you, {2d}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry...
I don't really
know if it's good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um...
It's kinda dirty. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do your best and
work hard. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a cool stone.
Where did you
find that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, over there.
Maybe I'll go
get one. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What? It's not
that easy to find
one? {NextPage_49}
Well that's not
fair. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an unusual
looking stone... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}What's that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, you'll
pick up anything
won't you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You got this from
the mountain?
It's pretty. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It'd be even better
if we could eat it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, a record. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've always liked
music, {2d}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you listen
to that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of
seasoning is that? {NextPage_49}
You got that from
{CharName_25}, right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I haven't had
{CharName_25}'s cooking
in awhile. {NextPage_49}
Maybe I'll give
them a visit. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you get that
medal from {CharName_11}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The person who gives
such a treasure is
as great as the {NextPage_1}person who keeps
the treasure. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Make sure to
treasure that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's great.
Does it make you feel
you are the best? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Oooh!
That's a beautiful
necklace! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Could it make
something interesting
happen? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm, sheet music. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you got this
from {CharName_9}. {NextPage_49}
She really likes
you doesn't she. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I remember when I
was made to practice
piano. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Is that a firework?
That's amazing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, are you
going to light them
by yourself? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I think about
having kids, it
makes me think {NextPage_1}back to how
my parents were. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They're doing well,
but I haven't seen
them in a while.{NextPage_49}
I wonder what
they're doing
now...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You meet lots of
interesting people
when you travel,{NextPage_49}
but surprisingly
enough, your child
turns out to be {NextPage_1}the absolute most
interesting. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Usually wherever you
go, you'll see adults
who've forgotten {NextPage_1}how to laugh like
children. {NextPage_49}
The adults here
are different.
They're all smiles. {NextPage_49}
That's why when I
came to
{Location_43_30_23},{NextPage_1}I felt we stumbled
on something great.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what kind of
man our kid will
become?{NextPage_49}
I want him to be
responsible and
decisive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, he'll deal
with that when the
time comes. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What was that...
That thing you
gave me before? {NextPage_49}
Um, well anyway
it was delicious! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}The food you made
was delicious. {NextPage_49}
We have to teach our
son how to cook!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, that
food you made was
delicious. {NextPage_49}
Thank you
very much. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}You've come a long
way as a farmer. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {2d}. {NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_10}{Location_36_23_128}{_f2}s
crops are wonderful.{NextPage_49}
That's what all
the people say. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}{2d}, your
cooking is great❤ {NextPage_49}
You should open a
restaurant! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, you've
become quite the
farmer. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're really good
at growing crops. {NextPage_49}
You must love
crops. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm so lucky to be
able to have your
cooking, {2d}. {NextPage_49}
You'll only get
better... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, you like
animals right?
Try harder. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you
try growing some
more crops? {NextPage_49}
After all you
do have all that
land. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do I have to learn
how to cook?{NextPage_49}
I don't think
you're that bad
{2d}... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Life on the farm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And children
as well.
Amazing... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's because we
had such a relaxed
life. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well... {NextPage_49}
I wouldn't have been
able to experience
this anywhere else...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I never thought it
was going to last
this long. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The people here
are really
interesting. {NextPage_49}
I've always been a
people watcher,
even before {NextPage_1}I was married to you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
People watching
is fun. {NextPage_49}
Especially the
people of
{Location_43_30_23}.{NextPage_49}
They all enjoy their
life. {NextPage_49}
That's probably why
I like it here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I watched {2d}
for quite some time. {NextPage_1}You really just go
and wander around
sometimes. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......
It's gotten nice
and warm. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_25}I'm sleepy... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everyone just kind
of zones out in
the Spring. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whew, hot.
Still, it's nice
weather today!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a great night
to go to the
{Location_43_33_23}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I used to collapse
a lot in Summer
from the heat. {NextPage_49}
I used to watch the
people as they'd
walk along the road,{NextPage_49}
but I'd always
forget about the
blazing sun above. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want something
cool and refreshing
to eat... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's gotten a little
cooler now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder why the
food tastes better
in Autumn. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I suddenly feel
like music. {NextPage_49}
Maybe I'll go listen
to {CharName_27}
play guitar. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Our son picks up lots
of things and shows
them to me when we{NextPage_1}go to the forest.
How cute. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow it's cold!
But, it's still
feels nice. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Once I went up the
mountain in the
wintertime... {NextPage_49}
I got lost, and
they almost sent out
a search party! {NextPage_49}
Now I can sit and
laugh about it. {NextPage_49}
----------x----------
I want to go
somewhere again... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everyday the same
old habits...
So boring... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can take care of
a lot of housework if
it's once in a while.{NextPage_49}
Everyday would be
a little too
much though... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm?
Did you want
something from
your son? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Our son is
growing up well. {NextPage_49}
In spite of the
fact that I'm
his parent. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When things get
dirty they should
get cleaned up. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Not because I'm
a parent but more
on a personal level.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {2d}.
I was taking a
little rest. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not picky about
what I read as long
as it's interesting. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, a lot of time
has passed. {NextPage_49}
Time flies when
you're having
fun! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I get the feeling I
had to do something. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I didn't think
it's worth spending
time looking for.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know what
I should do with
the house. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My son tells me
that I don't have
to do anything... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.........Zzz... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry, I'm busy.
Can we talk later? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm really sorry.
Thank you! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's nice to be
together with Daddy♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All clean♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't cry, baby. {NextPage_0}
