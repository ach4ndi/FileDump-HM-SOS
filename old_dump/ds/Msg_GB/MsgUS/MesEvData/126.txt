\u1f40\u1fb5\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eStuart\u206c\u232c\u2328I like books.\u232b\u220cWhenever I start\u2328a new one, it's like\u2328embarking on an adventure!
\u1f40\u1fb5\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eStuart\u206c\u232c\u2328Daisy is a really\u2328hard worker.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb5\u1f4b\u2135\u220fI hope she stays\u2328here a long time...
