{50_30_0_3}{CharName_1},
isn't it nice to have Mommy play with you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {2d}.{NextPage_49}
I thought maybe {CharName_1} should
take over {24_2}Farm.
Why do you think?
{41_2_0}Definitely.
That's for {CharName_1} to decide.
----------x----------
Yep.
{CharName_1} was born on a farm, after
all. That kid'll make a great farmer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, that's true.
Maybe I was getting ahead of myself...
Growing up healthy is the most important.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, time for bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh yeah...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, there's not much
food left in refrigerator.
Could you put some more in?{NextPage_49}
Night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} just went to bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
By the way... {CharName_1}'s
been watching a lot of TV lately.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, you think that kid would be
interested in taking over the farm?{NextPage_49}
{CharName_1} seemed pretty
interested in the farm report...
What do you think?
{41_2_0}I bet you're right!
It's too early to tell.
----------x----------
Yep.
I bet that kid will be helping you out on
the farm before you know it.{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_26}I guess you're right.
But if you set a good example,
{CharName_1} will be sure to like farming.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
♪A necklace of♪
♪white flowers...♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
♪A necklace I got♪
♪from you...♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1},
just wait a sec, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's pretty good, {CharName_1}.
You want to sing that for Mommy?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d},
{CharName_1} is a really good
singer.{NextPage_49}
That kid learned that song in no time.
I bet {CharName_1}'s got talent.
{41_2_0}I bet you're right!
It's too early to tell.
----------x----------
Yep. We have the next Sinatra right here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Hmm....{32_3_232}
{50_30_0_26}I guess you're right.{NextPage_49}
{50_30_0_3}But if that kid can sing that well
with no training, I think we should try
being supportive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}What are you drawing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Mommy???{NextPage_49}
{50_30_0_25}Uh, that's real good...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} drew this.
What do you think it is?
{41_3_0}Flowers.
Me, of course.
Don't know.
----------x----------
Yes. Flowers.
Anyway, I think it's pretty good.
{50_30_0_3}I think that kid has talent...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Really?
If you say so, {2d}.{NextPage_49}
Hey!
{50_30_0_3}You don' t think {CharName_1}
is some sort of creative genius, do you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmmm.
It looks like flowers to me.
But {CharName_1} says it's “Mommy.”{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But depending on how you think about it,
{CharName_1} might be have real talent.{NextPage_49}
I bet we just can't appreciate it.
{50_30_0_3}...Maybe even a genius...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Whatcha doin'?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}You're bookin'!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey {2d},
{CharName_1} seems to be a pretty
good athlete. Don't you think?
{41_2_0}I don't know...
Of course.
----------x----------
I'm sure of it.
That kid loves running and jumping.
That kid will be a sports star.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sure. {CharName_1} is your kid, after
all. {50_30_0_3}We have to develop this talent.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey {2d},
{CharName_1} sure likes books.{NextPage_49}
That kid is a regular bookworm.
You know, just the other day...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Hey {CharName_1},
you readin' a book?{NextPage_49}
What kind of book is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, what kind of book is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}I'm gonna go start up the bath.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey {CharName_1},
still reading?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}You like books, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} loves to study, I can tell.
Maybe our kid will be a professor!
{41_2_0}I think so too.
Um. You're the kid's father...
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Yep.
A famous scholar... Wow!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Hahaha. Perhaps I am a little biased.
But we have to help {CharName_1} develop
good study habits in any case.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, there's something I
want to ask you.{NextPage_49}
I don't want to get in your face or
anything, but...{NextPage_49}
Have things been going well on the farm?
{CharName_7} is worried because
you haven't been shipping much.
{41_2_0}I'm sorry. I'll try harder.
Who cares about this dumb old farm!
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Do you really mean that?
{41_2_0}No, I'll try harder.
Sure I do!
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}You're kidding, right?
{41_2_0}I'm kidding.
I'm serious!
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}You're serious?!
Don't you care what happens
to the farm?!
{41_2_0}Of course I do. I'll try harder.
Not really...
----------x----------
I'm glad that you said that.
I feel a little better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You scared me there...
But I guess I'm OK now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If we don't make this farm work,
Vesta will worry about us...
Please try harder!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}But...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}B-But...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_7}OK, fine.
Just do whatever the heck you want.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That was a pretty singing voice just now.
...Was that {CharName_20}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It was {CharName_1}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey {2d},
I wonder if {CharName_1} could have a
talent for music...{NextPage_49}
{CharName_20} said so.
I think our kid really likes music, too.
What do you think, {2d}?
{41_2_0}I think so too.
I don't think so.
----------x----------
I thought you'd say that.
I hope things work out for
{CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure our kid has the makings
of a great musician...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really...?
Maybe I'm just being biased.{NextPage_49}
But our kid does have a great singing
voice. I think we have to be
supportive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} may be a great musician!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if {CharName_1}
has any artistic sense...
Could our kid be an artist?{NextPage_49}
What do you think, {2d}?
{41_2_0}Sure.
It's too early to tell.
----------x----------
If {CharName_21} said so, it's
good enough for me...{NextPage_49}
I wonder what kind of artist....
Maybe a metal sculptor like Cody...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, that's true. It's too early to say.{NextPage_49}
But if our kid has an artistic sense
like {CharName_21} said, then I think
we have to be supportive..{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, you scared me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well of course you can't beat {CharName_13},
he's much older than you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} is fleet on his feet.{NextPage_49}
{CharName_11} said so.
Could our kid be an athlete?
{41_2_0}Maybe so.
Don't be silly.
----------x----------
{CharName_1} seems to like sports...
...Maybe a pro athlete....{NextPage_49}
{CharName_13} would make a good
trainer, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Maybe. But I've never seen a kid
{CharName_1}'s age run like that.{NextPage_49}
That kid seems to like sports. Maybe we
have a future athlete in the family.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That professor said he wants
{CharName_1} to be his
assistant...{NextPage_49}
I knew my kid was smart!
{CharName_1} is a regular egghead, I know
it! What do you think, {2d}?
{41_2_0}I agree.
He's merely curious about stuff.
----------x----------
I knew you'd think so!
{CharName_1} could be a genius!{NextPage_49}
We have to do everything we can
to help out!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess so. {CharName_1} is still a kid.{NextPage_49}
But if {CharName_1}'s interested in
something, I think it's our duty as
parents to be supportive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, I'm a little worried.
Is everything going all right
with the farm?{NextPage_49}
This may be none of my business, but
how are things going, really?
{41_2_0}I'm sorry. I'll try harder.
I don't want to do farm work.
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}You can't mean that.
{41_2_0}Of course not. I'll try harder.
I'm serious!
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}You really mean that?
{41_2_0}No. I'll try harder.
Of course I do!
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}So you're really serious?!
You don't care what happens to the farm?!
{41_2_0}I'm sorry. I'll try harder.
No, not really...
----------x----------
I feel a better now that you've
said that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You scared me...
But I feel better now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}The kid is growing up now,
and I'd like to remodel the house.
We're going to be OK, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Wha-?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}But...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}.......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_7}....Fine.
Do whatever you like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know what you're trying to say...{32_3_232}
----------x----------
But I want you to listen to
what your mother and I say, too.{32_3_232}
----------x----------
For the love of...
This isn't from my side of the family...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of book are you reading?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You want to go for a walk or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why are you so serious?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Then why don't you just ask
your mother?
I'm sure she'd be happy to show you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, that's true.{32_3_232} I've got it.{NextPage_49}
I'll ask her for you. Then
you can ask her yourself when you
get the chance, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
It's about {CharName_1}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} seems very interested in
your work.{NextPage_49}
So if {CharName_1} and asks you, I'd
like you to take some time for your kid.
{41_2_0}Of course.
I'm too busy.
----------x----------
I knew you'd do it.{NextPage_49}
{50_30_0_3}You've got to teach that
kid as much about the farm
as you can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's why {CharName_1} didn't
want to ask you in the first place.{NextPage_49}
All right.
If you're really that busy, why not have
{CharName_1} help you?{52_0_0_0}
{39_48}{31}
Wouldn't that work?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
It's about {CharName_1}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think maybe {CharName_1} isn't very
interested in farm work. What do you say?
{41_2_0}Maybe not.
Of course my child is interested!
----------x----------
You think so too?
But if there's something else
{CharName_1} likes, that's fine too.{NextPage_49}
It's {CharName_1}'s life,
after all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You think so...?
If you say so, I guess maybe
it's true, but...{NextPage_49}
But if there's something else
{CharName_1} likes, that's fine too.{NextPage_49}
It's {CharName_1}'s life,
after all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How are things going?
The farm, I mean.
{41_2_0}It's going well.
Not great...
----------x----------
Really?{50_30_0_35}
Well, that's good.{NextPage_49}
It's just that {CharName_1}'s getting
bigger and all...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm... What are we going to do?
{50_30_0_9}{CharName_1} grows bigger every
day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Music is nice, but you should help your
mother out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Art is nice, but you should help your
mother out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sports are awesome, but you should help
your mother out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Studying is great, but you should help your
mother out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know you like the farm, but you're
still young. You have to try doing lots
of things while you still can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey {2d}...
{50_30_0_9}{CharName_1} still hasn't come home.{NextPage_49}
It's getting so late...{NextPage_49}
Where could that kid be?
{41_2_0}I'll go looking.
{CharName_1} is an adult now.
----------x----------
Well, that's true.
But it's so late.
Couldn't you go out and have a look?
{41_2_0}Sure I'll go.
{CharName_1} will be back soon.
----------x----------
Yes, please do...
I'll look for him myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm. Listening to {CharName_27}'s guitar?
There's nothing wrong with music, but a
father worries if his kid is out so late.{NextPage_49}
That kid certainly does like music.
Do we have a future musician on our hands?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm. If you say so...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_1}'s back.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where've you been?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just a second...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm. Listening to {CharName_27}'s guitar?
There's nothing wrong with music, but a
father worries if his kid's out so late.{NextPage_49}
That kid certainly does like music.
Do we have a future musician on our hands?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I ask you something strange?
{41_2_0}No.
Sure.
----------x----------
Why are you being so cold?!
I just want to ask a question!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well...
Do round things ever look square?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}???
Of course not.
----------x----------
You don't understand that either, do you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, that's what I thought.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The thing is, {CharName_1}
asked me that out of the blue...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come again?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm... I wonder.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So that's what happened.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if our kid might want to be an
artist... I think {CharName_1} is
quite talented...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK...
What should I do?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK. Ready?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ready... Set... Go!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Go {CharName_1}!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Finished!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_13} is pretty fast, isn't he?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
{50_30_0_9}{CharName_1} still isn't home.{NextPage_49}
It's so late. Where
could that kid be?
{41_2_0}I'll go look.
{CharName_1} is an adult now.
----------x----------
Well, that's true.
But I'm still worried.
Could you go look?
{41_2_0}Alright, I'll go.
{CharName_1} will be back soon.
----------x----------
Please do...
I'll have a look myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_19} seems to like {CharName_1}...
Being interested in {CharName_19}'s research
is fine, but staying out at all hours...{NextPage_49}
I wonder if our kid's thinking
of becoming a scholar...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm. If you say so.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_1}'s back.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where've you been?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, just a second...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_19} seems to like {CharName_1}...
Being interested in {CharName_19}'s research
is fine, but staying out at all hours...{NextPage_49}
I wonder if our son thinks
of becoming a scholar...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing there by yourself?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why?{NextPage_49}
I don't know the details, but it was
before you were born...
I think it was in the spring.{NextPage_49}
{CharName_7} and your mother came
here.{NextPage_49}
But {CharName_7} had been here before, with
some guy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I only asked {CharName_7} about it once.
But that person was your mother's father.
That makes him your grandfather.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't really know.{NextPage_49}
I never saw him again and
{CharName_7} won't tell me
any more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
She doesn't seem to want to talk about
it. She just says he's working on the farm
in honor of your grandfather's memory.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?
I'm sure your mother would be happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What're you looking at?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you thinking about something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's been a long time, hasn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}'s all grown up,
and we've both gotten older...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why, your hair's turned all white
and you're all wrinkly! Heheh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
{41_2_0}Check out the mirror, Prune Face.
You're as handsome as ever.
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}Hey...{32_7_208}
{50_30_0_3}I guess neither of us is young anymore.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_10}Well...
You're certainly being nice today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_10}But we still have work to do.
{CharName_7} still works so hard every day...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}... {2d}...
What's wrong?
{2d}! {CharName_0}!!{NextPage_49}
{CharName_1}! Call {CharName_31} here
right away!!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hang in there {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How is she?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Working hard, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How are sales?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, you don't have anything to sell.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you're sold out, why don't
you come on home?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to help out, but I'm
not much of a salesman...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Van has a shop here sometimes, but do
you think he really makes much money?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you have any milk Vesta would
certainly buy it from you....
And Celia loves flowers.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's no point in me buying from you.
I'll pass.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_7}.........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_7}It's OK. Just let me be.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}What do you want?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_5}........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that for me?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Thanks.
I'll certainly take it then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_4}Oh, I see.
{50_30_0_0}No, it's OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd really like that, but I'd better
pass for today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I said no...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You take it, {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Well, that's nice of you.
OK, I'll take it.
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_2}Oh, I see.
{50_30_0_0}Well, never mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know that I like that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}You expect me to eat that?!
Give me a break.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't mind just looking at it, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You go ahead and have it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not interested in that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} might be interested
in that, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_3}Hey {CharName_1},
how's it going?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You think the kid looks like me?
{32_1_244}.{32_1_244}.{32_1_244}.{32_1_244}Or maybe more like you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess kids aren't so bad, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He looks happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}I don't really like animals, but
{23}'s cute.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}He seems to like you pretty well.
I wonder what he thinks of me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can {23} do any tricks?
Shake or beg?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't like animals much.
But that cat is cute.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pretty quiet kitty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't get that too close to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I told you I'm not much for animals.
In particular, I can't stand chickens.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It has a tiny little beak.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's cute, but...
It's still a chicken.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't mind chickens, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know, I kind of like ducks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ducks seem kind of clumsy, don't they?
I like that about them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if a duck would sell for more
than a chicken...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure you know this, but it's
important to check out the soil quality
when planting seeds.{NextPage_49}
Some kinds of seeds won't grow in
bad quality soil.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think all of the seeds that Vesta sells
will grow in any kind of soil.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your crops.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That seed should grow into a good crop.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_3}That's one of our crops, huh?
Can I eat it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
OK, I'll give it a try later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yeah, I guess you want to sell it, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I eat that?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Leave the tasting of the crops to me.
I used to work on a farm, after all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The taste of a crop is more important than
its appearance. You've gotta try them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's milk from our farm.
I don't know much about milk, but is
it OK if I drink it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Can I drink that?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Milking cows must be tough.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You have to be on a farm to get fresh
milk like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know we make it and all, so this might
sound a little strange, but...
I don't like cheese very much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just can't stand the smell
of cheese.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not gonna eat it. Sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please, no butter.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't stand it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did one of our chickens lay that egg?
Don't drop it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going to scramble that up for me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you catch that, {2d}?
Good job. It still looks fresh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't fish, but maybe
{CharName_1} would like to do it
sometime...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} might like to see
that...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, a wild plant....
They grow all around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess those can be pretty good
if you cook them right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Out of all the wild plants, I particularly
like mushrooms.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, that looks pretty good...
Could I eat it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}All right. Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_2}I'm just supposed to look at it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like spicy food.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}...That's an odd looking hoe.
I've never seen one like it.
But it looks really heavy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}I once heard of a kind of hoe that could
till a lot of soil at once...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I never saw a hoe like that at
Vesta's farm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}...That's seen a lot of use.
And it looks pretty easy to use....{NextPage_49}
{32_1_244}Hey, didn't that used to
be at Vesta's house?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I never used that hoe, but I thought
Vesta liked it pretty well...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe's still pretty new.
You've got to break it in...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was never very good at working in the
fields, so I can't use a hoe very well...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've used that hoe quite a bit...
Does it feel like it's been broken in?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Using a hoe can be pretty tiring, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe's been used an awful lot.
You're really working hard...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Vesta's hoe looked about like that.
I guess you're pretty used to working
in the fields too...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}What a strange sickle...
It looks pretty old. Can you still use it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}I've never seen a sickle like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}That's a strange sickle, but it
looks like it's pretty sharp.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a strange sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}Got a new sickle, eh?
You've got to use it more...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_145}{50_30_0_9}You shouldn't go swinging something
like that around...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing with that sickle?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not very interested in sickles.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've used that sickle quite a bit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You use that sickle to cut grass, right?
Looks like a lot of work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a watering can?
What a strange shape.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}There's just something strange about that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Does that watering can water a lot
of crops at once or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Going to water the crops?
Once or twice a day is plenty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The bigger the watering can the better.
It's heavy, but at least you don't
have to go back for more water much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You use that to milk the cows, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You want me to milk the cows?
Sorry, anything but that.
I just can't stand animals.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty strange machine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You use that to shear the sheep?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You want me to shear the sheep?
Sorry, anything but that.
I don't do well around animals.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If I tried to shear the sheep, they'd
probably end up all bloody.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those clippers look really old.
Do they still cut OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
You carrying that for a reason?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not very good at using
things like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty stone...
I didn't know you could find
things like that laying around here...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet Vesta would like to see that
stone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If it's a rare stone, do you think it
might be worth something...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's pretty strange.
You collect those things?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry.
I'm not interested in that stuff.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Vesta and Celia like that kind
of flower.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Different kinds of wild plants grow
depending on the season, so you
should stock up while you can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've heard that some kinds of wild plants
can have an effect on crops.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Hey, a record.
If you have any new ones, let me
listen to them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's nice to be able to work outside
while listening to music.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Our farm's pretty great, huh?
You can listen to records and everything.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you have any new ones, let me
listen to them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that some kind of spice?
Wow, that's quite a smell.
Spicy, just how I like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet that would be pretty tasty
if you used it in cooking...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}Nice sound.{NextPage_1}How did you make it do that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}...What an unusual drum.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?
It's all sparkly and gaudy.
Not exactly my taste, {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you going to do with that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that yours?
I've never seen you wear it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've sure carry around dangerous stuff.
Fireworks, huh? That's pretty big.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You'd better put it away. It's dangerous.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}Hey, I'm Vesta's brother.
I help out around the farm...
Did I tell you this already?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_144}{50_30_0_9}I used to be a top businessman
in the city.{NextPage_49}
I guess there's no point in worrying
about it, but if I hadn't gotten sick,
I'd probably be company president by now.{NextPage_49}
But I'm glad I'm here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}...I'm not very good with people, so
you might think I'm unsociable, but I'm
just... Oh, I don't know how to say it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Oh yeah, that thing you gave me
was really good.
Pretty impressive.{NextPage_1}That's one of my favorites.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}About that thing you gave me...
To tell the truth, I couldn't stand it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}By the way, that {29_0}
could have been sweeter.
Did you use enough fertilizer?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Oh, by the way...
That {29_0} I tasted for you
was awful good. Yep, it was tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Oh, yeah...
That {29_0} was just fantastic.
I've never eaten anything like it.
You're good. I'm pleasantly surprised.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}That {29_0} I had a
while ago was the kind of thing I like.
Yep, it was pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me was
good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}By the way, that milk I had
was pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}Oh, that's right.
That milk I had was just amazing.
You should be able to sell it for a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I almost forgot. That milk I had a
while ago was fantastic. Even I can
tell that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}That milk you gave me seemed
a little smelly.
Oh, goat milk?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}That milk you gave me was a
little smelly, but it tasted pretty
good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About that {29_0} you gave me,
did you season it yourself?{NextPage_49}
It was just the way I like it.
It was delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}That dish that you cooked up was
pretty good.
Why don't you make it again?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}This might sound strange coming from me,
but you seem more like a real
farmer now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}You know, Vesta was just saying
the other day how you were a fast worker.
I think so, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}I've been thinking lately that you
seem just like a real sous
chef.{NextPage_49}
You know so many great recipes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're working hard, I can tell.
And it's helping the farm.{NextPage_1}Aren't you a lot faster
at your work now?
I think maybe you have.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Working hard at growing crops, eh?
That can be difficult.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're working hard at cooking, I see.
Hasn't the number of dishes you can
cook increased recently?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't help you much with the animals,
but I do have my own ideas about how to
grow crops. I might be able to help.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you like our current way of
life, {2d}?
{41_3_1}Of course.
Sort of.
Not really.
----------x----------
Oh, that's good.
I like it, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see.
Well, that's the way it goes.
We have a long future ahead of us, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It hurts me to hear you say that.
But things will pick up.{NextPage_49}
I'm looking forward to seeing
{CharName_1} grow up and all...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Working with the animals seems tough. I
can at least help clean out the barn.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what Takakura thinks about
me...?
I think I'm a nice guy, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}'s been talking back a
lot recently.
I guess that kid takes after me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't you think that Takakura's looking
a lot older lately?
I hope he's OK...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is your work going well?
{41_3_1}Of course.
It's not bad.
It's terrible.
----------x----------
That's my {2d}.
Good job.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But... we're making
money, right?
No?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But we're not doing all that
bad, are we?
As long as we can eat, we'll be OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I ask you something?
Am I an old man?
{41_3_1}Not at all.
I've been shopping for your cane.
It's a close call...
----------x----------
You really think so?
That's a relief.
I'm still OK...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ugh... I thought so...
Oh, by the way...
Your cane is on backorder.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see... I guess you're right...
We're both pushing it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We've lived here for quite a long time,
but recently I've felt really good
I think I'm suited for farm life.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I'm in the mood, I'll even take care
of your tools for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's great that we can plant trees here.
Hybrid fruits sell for a lot of money.
Vesta doesn't handle those, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, why did you decide to name this
place {24_2}Farm?
Just wondering.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, what's up?
Done with your work already?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't a drink after work refreshing?
It's pretty good even without working.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll go right home after my drink.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's kind of nice to drink like this, just
the two of us...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Farm work isn't easy.
You're pretty amazing, you know that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what {CharName_1} is
interested in these days...{NextPage_49}
I bet if you showed that kid a
bunch of different things, it might
make {CharName_1} interested in them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, have you been talking
to {CharName_1} recently?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Well, that's good.
But I think that kid is in a rebellious
phase...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe you should leave the kid alone.
It's just a phase.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It may seem strange for me to say this
now, but I don't help out with the work
much, do I? What do you think of that?
{41_3_1}Don't worry about it.
You're a lazy old man.
I've given up on you.
----------x----------
Really? That makes me feel better.
It's been bothering me, but I'm really
not cut out for this kind of work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I suppose you're right.
{CharName_1} probably thinks so, too.
But I have to be myself...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um... I see...
That's a little harsh. But I guess
nothing can be done about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have I mellowed out since we got married?
Celia said that I had. She said I talk
more gently nowadays.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to help out with the farm work
every once in a while.
I probably can't do much, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope {CharName_1} grows up healthy
and happy. Well, any child with your genes
should be fine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Having our kid grow up means that we'll
have more time for the two of us, but
it's kind of lonely, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, hello.
You come here often, too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just stopped by for a minute.
I'll be going home soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Even a guy like me likes to stop
and talk with people sometimes.
Of course, I mostly listen...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
On days like this, I like to get outside
as much as possible.
It feels good and it's good for you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Vesta plants Tomatoes, Watermelon,
and Potatoes at this time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's so nice out, I was just
taking a little break.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You taking a walk, too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a little hot, but
it feels really good in the shade
of the trees.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I used to swim in the ocean all
the time. But nobody swims here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Vesta plants Melons, Watermelons, and
Turnips at this time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Vesta plants Melons, Yams, and
Turnips at this time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a little chilly...
Where are you off to?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I'm walking somewhere I'm
usually thinking about something.
About what? Oh, lots of stuff.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is a tough season for the crops.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Vesta plants Strawberries, Potatoes,
and Carrots at this time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not much of a cook.
Could you dish up something for me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Celia used to mess up all the time when
she was cooking. Do you have that problem?
{41_3_1}Leave the cooking to me!
That depends on your definition of “mess.”
If you don't like it, FINE!
----------x----------
{50_30_0_3}I'm looking forward to it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I'll eat anything you want to
cook me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}S-sorry.
I didn't mean anything by it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes I think I might like to try
my hand at cooking...{NextPage_49}
But don't worry.
I'll eat the stuff I cook myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Vesta likes baking bread and pastries
more than cooking.
Are you like that?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
I see...
I'm not very big on sweets, though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's good.
I don't like sweets very much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've learned how to cook a bit
recently.
I'm not as good as you, of course.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you're not here, I eat the
food in the refrigerator, so try
and keep it stocked, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what kind of cooking
{CharName_1} likes...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} is eating a lot lately.
Growing kids'll do that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everything we cook should be great.
We use the best ingredients, after all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what {CharName_1} wants
to be in the future...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} seems to be keeping
a diary. Have you looked at it?
I suppose we shouldn't read it, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It might be best for you to stay out
of {CharName_1}'s room for a while.
Older kids need their privacy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I look at {CharName_1}'s room,
I remember when that kid was just a baby.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you look at {CharName_1}'s toy box
and bookshelves, I think you can tell
what that kid's interested in.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess adults can't appreciate what
kids really find valuable...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} seems to be
reading a lot of pretty difficult
books recently.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess we can't just walk
into {CharName_1}'s room without
knocking anymore.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Our kid's room is always
going to be a kid's room to me...
Well, I guess that's natural...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like to come here and look at the
fields occasionally. I might learn
something we can use on our farm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you come to buy some seeds?
Then you'd better ask Vesta or
Celia.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is where we raise stable crop
varieties for shipping to the city.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I made that scarecrow over there.
We didn't really need it, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Zzzzzzz.......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Zzzzzz... Zzzz...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The room seems kind of empty
without a bed in it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you watch TV a lot?
{41_3_1}All the time.
Occasionally.
Never.
----------x----------
So, you're a couch potato, eh?
I don't watch it much myself.
Is it really that good?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess there are some programs about
farming... I wonder if they're any good...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Then what do we have one for?{NextPage_1}Not just for its looks, is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know, we've got a pretty big house
for just three people...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The quality of the soil is different
from field to field.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't think I'm cut out for farm work,
but I am interested in crops.
I'm researching hybridization.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hybridization is when you take the genes of
two plants and make a third, new plant.
It can be pretty interesting.{NextPage_49}
For example, if you combined a Tomato and
a Watermelon, you'd get a {26_0_5}
that has both of their genes.{NextPage_49}
Or if you combined a Melon and a
Strawberry, you'd get a {26_0_10}
that has both of their genes.{NextPage_49}
And if you combine the {26_0_5} and the
{26_0_10}, you get something that has
genes from all of those plants.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Daryl may be researching hybrids too,
but he's such a weird guy and all.
Who knows what he's up to?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to help you out by coming
up with some good new crops
on my own.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is a good place for a pasture.
It gets plenty of sun and wind.
Yep, it's just about perfect...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love to watch the grass bend and wave
in the wind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_30_0_9}I think I'd better pass for now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where are you off to in this rain?
It's not good for your health.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't feel like going out on days like
this... But being cooped up inside
all day is boring...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can care for the tools and the
the freezer, you know...
I don't mind giving Takakura a hand.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought I might do a little
cleaning around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't really take care of the animals,
but I can at least clean up after them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If we don't keep the barn clean, the
animals could become ill.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's up?
I just thought I'd come and have a
chat with Takakura.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought I'd ask Takakura to teach me
about the farm.{NextPage_0}
