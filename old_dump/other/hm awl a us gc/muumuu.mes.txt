Welcome.♪
I'm so happy you came.
Make yourself at home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come on.
Don't talk like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're happy because I'm here, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Uh... OK, OK...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, we seem to be out of your favorite.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They may have some at the {Location_43_35_23}.
Shall I go see if I can buy some?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just wait until I get back.
Promise.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I forgot my purse.
They don't give that stuff away, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All bad, I suppose?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh really?
Then I'm glad I forget my purse.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
Good evening.
Come right in.
{41_2_0}With pleasure.
I'm sorry.
----------x----------
Oh dear. This isn't my day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You came at just the right time.
Griffen is about to play a concert for us.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's not true!
You'll stay and listen, won't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Teehee. He's starting!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I had a good time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He's so cool when he plays his guitar.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you want to listen?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...
Um, you're pretty strange, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But I think she died happy.
With her husband and child with her...
And such wonderful friends.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Griffin, could you sing something?
For her.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you're selling something, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let me take a look.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you selling?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}....
What are you selling?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, there's nothing here.
You're new at this selling thing, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Bye, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's nothing I want in particular.
I thought there might be something good...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll come back some other time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like the {29_0} but
how much is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
{34_1_132}Oh, did you give me a discount?
You're the best, {CharName_0}.
I'll take it.♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see.
OK, I'll take one.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmmm...
Yes, I suppose I'll take it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...
I guess I'll pass for now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I'll take the {29_0}...
How much is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
I hope you sell a lot of stuff.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Hmm... {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}It's nothing. Don't worry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Why don't you leave me alone?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}It's nice of you to worry, but
please leave me alone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}This isn't my day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}I don't feel well. My stomach's upset.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_4}Listen...
Just leave me alone!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think maybe I'll go out on the town!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Oh, good morning...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}You're in a good mood so early..{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I have high blood
pressure, you know.
Being a secretary was really tough...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}Oh, {CharName_0}.
Hello.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}Oh, {CharName_0}.
Done with your work already?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}When you have time, come to the {Location_43_33_23}.
I would love a little girl talk!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you up to?
It can be dangerous for a girl to
go out alone at this hour.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How are you doing?
Don't you get up early on the farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}Welcome.
Make yourself at home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you want to order, talk to
{CharName_27} at the bar.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}Enjoy yourself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}Welcome.
Make yourself comfortable.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you want to order, talk to
{CharName_27} at the bar.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You need to rest if you want to work!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_0}.
You still up at this hour?{NextPage_1}Did you know it's bad for your skin?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't seem to sleep today...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just thought I'd stop by.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}Ooh! That looks good.❤
I just love that kind of thing.
{41_2_0}It's yours.
Oh really?
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}Really?
{34_1_132}You're sweet, {CharName_0}.❤{NextPage_1}Thanks.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's so nice of you!
Thanks a lot.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}.................
{50_3_0_26} Goodbye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks good.{NextPage_1}Being a housewife must be hard.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}How nice!❤
I love that type of thing.{NextPage_49}
But I'd really rather get something like
that from a handsome gentleman...
{41_2_0}Go on and take it.
You're pretty selfish.
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}How nice!❤
I love that type of thing.{NextPage_49}
Is that a present from your husband?
I wish someone would treat me that way!
{41_2_0}It's for you.
Nice, huh?
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Really?!{NextPage_49}
{50_3_0_3}I've never gotten a present like this
from a girl, so I'm speechless.
{34_1_133}I'll treasure it.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
ERROR
ERROR
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}.....................{50_3_0_26}Maybe so.
I guess all women feel like that,
deep down in their hearts.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}How nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Very nice.
A present from your husband?
I wish someone would treat me like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Ewww! What is that?
{50_3_0_7}I'm sorry, I..............
I just can't stand that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_7}I really mean it!
Stop it!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}...........What is that, anyway?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}..............Get that away from me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}{34_1_132}How cute!
Hello! It's {CharName_3}!❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You must have looked this cute when
you were young.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_26}Such a cute child. It's hard to believe
it's {CharName_30}'s.
{50_3_0_3}It's good your child takes after you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}How cute!
Hello! It's {CharName_3}!❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You must have looked this adorable when
you were young.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Who does your child look like?
Your husband's always wearing sunglasses
so I can't really tell.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}How cute!
Hello! It's {CharName_3}!❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You must have looked just like this when
you were young.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's nice to have a lot of kids around.
Hm?
Well, Rock's kind of like a kid, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Eeek!{NextPage_49}
You startled me.
That's your dog,
isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}{34_1_132}Hee hee.
He's pretty cute.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}{34_1_132}Aww, a kitty cat!❤
He's purring.
How cute!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
His fur and tail are both
so cuuuuute.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh!
You startled me. A chicken, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Chickens are handy because they
lay eggs.
.............Is that a........female?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do any of the chickens at {24_2}Farm
lay golden eggs?
I guess that's pretty rare, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How cute!
A baby chick.
When did it hatch?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's so soft and fluffy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's chirping.
Could it be hungry?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, a duck.
Is it one of yours?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He has an adorable face.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Aw, how cute. It's still a baby?
I guess that's why it's so small.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What pretty feathers.
So shiny.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't suppose this one would turn
into a swan when it grows up?{NextPage_49}
I remember my mother reading
me that story when I was a
little girl.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?
Flower seeds or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come to think of it, we share a field with
the {Location_43_35_23}...
But I haven't been there in a long time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I always seem to forget to water
my plants.
You're amazing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a nice vegetable.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The one vegetable dish I make is
salad. I just cut it up and use dressing
from the {Location_43_31_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh!
That milk looks delicious!❤
{41_2_0}Try it.
It sure does.
----------x----------
Really?
It's nice having a farm so close.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love sweet and rich milk!♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Fresh milk sure is great!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese looks good.
Did you make it on your farm?
{41_2_0}Try some.
Looks good, doesn't it?
----------x----------
Really?
It's nice having a farm so close.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love all kinds of cheese.
I like to put it in salad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It must be nice to be able to make cheese.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter looks tasty.
Did you make it on your farm?
{41_2_0}Try some.
Looks good, doesn't it?
----------x----------
Really?
It's nice having a farm so close.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I put butter on everything.
I use a package a week.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet butter made with fresh
milk sure is delicious...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that going to be a chicken?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like my eggs runny.
I can't stand it when they're hardboiled.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Eggs are great, aren't they?
You can make so many things with them.
Or so I hear.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have strong preferences about fish.
I love {25_4_116}, but I can't
stand {25_4_142}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't believe it...
That fish looked at me!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Eww...
Now I'm gonna have bad dreams...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that, grass?
Oh, one of those wild plants, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are those in season?
What do you know...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that yourself?
Wow!❤
{41_2_0}Have her eat it.
Just show her.
----------x----------
Well, I don't know if I should...
OK, I'll have it later.
{34_1_132}Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks quite good.
Make some for me next time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love great cooks! ❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?{NextPage_49}
Oh, it's a “Hoe.” I see.
You use that on the farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks a little strange.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?{NextPage_49}
Oh, it's a “hoe.” I see.
You use that on the farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe looks worn and old.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?{NextPage_49}
Oh, it's a “hoe.” I see.
You use that on the farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe's still new.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?{NextPage_49}
Oh, it's a “hoe.” I see.
You use that on the farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck at your work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?{NextPage_49}
Oh, it's a “hoe.” I see.
You use that on the farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's pretty old, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?{NextPage_49}
A sickle?
You use that on the farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a weird looking sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?{NextPage_49}
A sickle?
You swing that around on the farm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a strange sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?{NextPage_49}
A sickle?
Did you just buy it? It looks new.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's still pretty shiny.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?{NextPage_49}
A sickle?
I don't see them around here much.
{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's kind of scary looking.{NextPage_1}{38_3}TBD{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?{NextPage_49}
A sickle?
That would look charming on a den wall.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You use that to cut things, right?
Does it really work?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, what is that?
You use that to water plants?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Leave it to a pro to
know about these things.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's a watering can.
Are you growing some flowers?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry, you use that
on your farm, don't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, a watering can.
It must be hard to water every day!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like getting flowers, but I
don't like growing them{NextPage_49}
They'll be fine one day and
wilted the next...
I always feel so betrayed...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an old watering can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}Are you sure there aren't any
extra holes in that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an unusual machine.
What is it again?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, so you use that to get milk, huh?
{50_3_0_3}That's kind of funny.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an unusual machine.
What is it again?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, so you use that to get milk, huh?
{50_3_0_3}That's kind of funny.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an unusual machine.
What is it again?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, so you use that to get milk, huh?
{50_3_0_9}I don't think I want to drink
your milk unless you clean that thing...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You use that to shear sheep?
Yes, I've seen people do that.
It's what they use on poodles, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It must be hard to shear a
sheep.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are nice and new.
Are those clippers for shearing sheep?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But they're so cute with their
fluffy coats...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going to shear some sheep?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But they're so cute with their
fluffy coats...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are those clippers?
Do they still work?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It can hurt when your hair gets tangled.
Be careful when you use those.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Is that new?
How nice.
Good luck with your work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}Going to work?
You're a hard worker, aren't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Keep up the good work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}That tool's seen a lot of use.
Does it still work?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}I guess I shouldn't focus on appearances.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a lovely stone.
Did you dig that up yourself?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think {CharName_6} gave me one like
it once.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}Go throw that away.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}You really like that?
You're a little strange, honey.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a pretty flower.
What, a present for me?
{41_3_1}That's right.
If you like it, feel free.
No.
----------x----------
{34_1_132}Well, how nice of you!
Thanks. I'll put it in my room.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?
{34_1_132}Thanks.
I love flowers.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a pretty flower.
Are you going decorate your room?
............How nice..........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a pretty flower.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, I used to listen to those
all the time when I was younger.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There was a cafe near my house
that always had the best records for
listening and dancing. I went there a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did {CharName_25} give you that?
She's a good cook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Food is tastier if it has some
spices in it, don't you think?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}What an odd sound.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}That's a strange drum.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, did you come in first place
at something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty medal.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's nice but it's a little scary.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's not my style.
When would you wear something like that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sheet music?
It looks difficult.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I may not look it, but I've taken voice
lessons and I can read music.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you know that smoke from fireworks
can make your skin look old?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He tried to give me one, too, but
I refused.
I told him to light one for me instead.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, how nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, that's nice.
As long as you like it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
At first I was a little skeptical about a
woman running a farm, but when you think
about it, that's just a stereotype.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nowadays they say career women are
attractive.
I don't think I could ever be one, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like it in {Location_43_30_23},
but I sure miss cherry pies and bowling.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wasn't very good at bowling, but
I used to have fun betting with my
friends over the results.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Up until now, I've gone out with
a lot of selfish men.
I'm attracted to them for some reason.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I know.
A nice quiet man would be much better
for me, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, the {29_0} you
gave me a while ago was very
tasty.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}This is hard to say...
But I don't really like {29_0}.
But it was nice of you to give it to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}That cheese was delicious.❤
I didn't give any to
{CharName_27}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese smelled a little funny.
I only need a bit of that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese was delicious.❤{NextPage_49}
It's pretty rare, so of course
I didn't give any to
{CharName_27}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Thanks for that cheese.
{CharName_27} thought it was
good too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}That butter was rich
and very tasty.
I'd love some more.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_9}That butter had a kind of... odor.
It was too strong for everything I
tried with it. I'm sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}That butter was good.
You can't make much of that, can you?
It was very nice of you to share it.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Thanks for the butter.
It was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}The {29_0} you made
was delicious.❤{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Thanks for the {29_0}.
You seem to like cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You must like your farm.
It's amazing how much you put into it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everyone says your cooking
is so good. Maybe one day
you can teach me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh...
What are you doing here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}Did you need something?
What is it?
{41_3_0}Let's talk about fashion.
I want to ask about men...
I want to talk about the farm.
----------x----------
Yes.
We girls do like that kind of thing.❤
Tell me if you find some nice clothes.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_26}About men?
I'm afraid I don't understand men well.
They seem like a whole different race.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Farm work must be hard.
Well, I guess nothing worth doing
is easy, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks for coming.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome.
Make yourself comfortable.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Yes?
Did you need me for something?
{41_3_0}I'm here for a rest.
How do you stay so attractive?
How've you been lately?
----------x----------
{50_3_0_26}You must be working hard.
Maybe I'll take a rest, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_31}Me?
{50_3_0_26}Well, I don't know...
Maybe it's the drinks we serve here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_26}Lately?
Oh, nothing much has happened.
But I guess that's good, in a way.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's important to work hard, but taking
breaks is just as important.
Drink up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's important just to rest sometimes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_134}Oh, hello.
Did you need me for something?
Would you like to talk?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is it something you can only tell me?
Go on, say it.
{41_3_0}I want to be prettier.
I want to have more fun.
Nothing.
----------x----------
{34_1_133}Well, that's nice.{NextPage_1}They say women in love are more attractive
but it can be hard to maintain that
feeling for a long time, I guess...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_134}Are you working too hard on the farm?
I think you should do what you want.
After all, you only live once.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_134}Are you sure?
You can talk about anything with me.
Come back if you change your mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}Hi there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How have you been lately?
Has anything interesting happened?
{41_3_0}My shoulders are so stiff.
The farm is such a pain.
I'm having so much fun.
----------x----------
{34_1_134}{50_3_0_26}You too?
My shoulders are stiff, too!{NextPage_1}I've heard they have special necklaces
that are supposed to help, but they can
be so ugly...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_26}I see.{NextPage_1}But doesn't it help to talk like this?
Working women have it so tough, it's
easy to get burnt out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}That's great.
I think I'd have more fun if I had a
boyfriend, though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you need a sympathetic ear, feel free
to come back any time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}It sure is warm.
It's nice and refreshing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_133}It's the season of love, isn't it?
It's so exciting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The flowers blooming around here sure
are pretty. I'm getting all emotional...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you know that ultraviolet rays are
strongest at this time of year?
Do you wear sunscreen?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I should take some lessons or something..{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want to lose weight by summer!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_133}It's so hot.
I feel faint.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess it's more comfortable here
than in other places.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_133}I always get romantic ideas on hot
summer nights.❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_133}I don't suppose you're seeking
a passionate romance?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The beach is great at this time of year!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's not bad here, but I always feel
on my guard when I go to other towns..
Especially at night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's gotten cooler, hasn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}There are lots of good foods at this
time of year. I hope I don't get fat!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel like taking a nap.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I never know what to wear at
this time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}If you make something good on your farm,
be sure to give me some!❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}I can't seem to concentrate.
Maybe I'll go shopping or something.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It sure is cold.
I'd like to eat something hot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}I may dress skimpily, but I actually
have poor circulation. I'm freezing!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hate wearing thick winter clothes.
They're just not stylish.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel so alone at this time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_133}It's chilly at this time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I'll make something hot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you get tired from your work,
stop here for a visit.
You can forget all your troubles!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Griffin's cocktails are the
best!
He created the recipes himself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can sometimes hear Griffin play
his guitar. Well, just sometimes...
You might hear it if you stop by often.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}Don't be shy.
Drink up. But not too much,
OK?❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I try not to worry about tomorrow.
After all, you never know what's going
to happen, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sigh...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's so relaxing here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes I feel less alone when I'm here
than when I'm surrounded by people.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}Heehee.
I felt that way today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you walk around here, your
shoes get all muddy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}Fashion can be inconvenient
at times.
But you've got to stick with it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Women need to be pretty and feminine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's so much natural beauty around here
that you can find relaxing spots all over.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is one of them.
I always feel better when I'm out here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't nature great?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_5}I'm sorry, but I don't want to
talk with you. If you keep talking to me
I might just explode.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_5}What!!!
This is the first time something like
this has happened to me!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_6}You monster!
Go away!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}{34_1_132}Hi.❤
{CharName_0}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Are we going to buy a queen-sized bed when
we get married? Oh, I want silk sheets!
{34_1_133}Aren't they great?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
To tell you the truth, I'd like to
stay with you right now.
It's so lonely sleeping alone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_132}We have to have kids.
I think it'll help our marriage.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you surprised me.
A date?
You must be kidding.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm so bored. Let's talk
about something interesting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_3}{34_1_132}Hi.❤
Darling...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't make me worry.
Not even once...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Most of the people around here don't
seem to know about us yet.{NextPage_49}
...I still get asked out on a lot
of dates.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}{34_1_132}Let's go out again.
No matter where we go around here
we end up meeting someone we know, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}I can't believe you!
How can you come and talk to me like
there's nothing wrong?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_2}It's too late now.
I never give men a
second chance.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't want to talk now....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It raining...
I feel so depressed...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I need a drink...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish it would stop raining.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral
Town has a dog that won
lots of disk catching contests.{NextPage_1}Aren't dogs cute?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral
Town has a horse that's won
lots of races.{NextPage_1}I love to see flowing manes on horses.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral
Town has won lots of chicken
festivals.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral
Town has won lots of cow
festivals.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral
Town has won lots of sheep
festivals.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's so nice of you!
But I'm a little busy right now.
I'm sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe later, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I'll go to bed soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's my bed time now, so
could you be going?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to be leaving soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going out now, so if you don't
mind....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See you later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}{CharName_1}♪
Have your Dad wash you
real well!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}You're all clean!❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_5}Oh just give him a bath!
Honestly!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I guess I should go.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What will you do?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Go.
Don't go.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, Griffin.{NextPage_1}What are we doing after this?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Well, that's true.
Hee hee.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, it's you, {CharName_0}.
Would you mind listening to me
for a bit?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I got dumped.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He was from the city, but...{32_3_232}
{50_3_0_7}He was cheating on me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This always happens to me.{NextPage_1}Everybody thinks of me like some kind of
pushover. Nobody's ever serious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh where is my Mr. Right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Oh well.{NextPage_1}There are plenty more fish in the sea.
I can't give up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Thank you. I feel better
now that I've talked about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}There aren't many women I can say these
kinds of things to here.{NextPage_1}I hope you'll let me do this again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He said that he loved the other girl more
than me.
He didn't even hesitate.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I got dumped again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He was from the city, but...{32_3_232}
{50_3_0_7}He was married....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
After talking with him for a while, I
realized that he even had kids.
I was so shocked I couldn't talk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why do men do things like that? Why can't
they be satisfied with one woman?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't there someone out there for me?{NextPage_1}I just want someone to love me. Only me.
Is it that difficult for a man to love
just one woman?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've got to find somebody nice like
you did.
Let's talk again sometime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I've got to find someone else now...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He was from the city and he was younger
than me. It was going so well.
But...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
As soon as I told him how old I was,
I never heard from him again...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He must have thought that we were
the same age.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A lot of men like younger women.{NextPage_1}I wish they wouldn't worry about that and
look at me for who I am.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What should I do?
Men are so selfish.{NextPage_1}They have women on the side, but get all
jealous of our male friends...{NextPage_1}They won't look at you if you're over 30.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's talk again sometime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This time he was an older man,
and very dependable.
He was so nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I started thinking about getting
married.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So I casually brought up the subject
of marriage.{NextPage_1}But he said he liked things as they were.
I thought maybe things would be OK if we
let them stay as they were, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
One day when I was with him, we happened
to run into one of his friends.{NextPage_1}He introduced me to him as his friend.{NextPage_1}Not his girlfriend.{NextPage_1}What about all the meals we ate together,
or the movies we went to see?
Didn't that mean anything?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I wasn't really dumped.{NextPage_1}I was never his girlfriend at all.
Just someone to have fun with.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm so tired.
I'm sick of men.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Griffin, what is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_0}I'm fine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}Yes.
Somehow, looking at Griffin's face
cheered me up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}It doesn't mean anything.
Come on, let's go home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_3_0_10}{CharName_0},
thanks for everything.
Bye.{NextPage_0}
