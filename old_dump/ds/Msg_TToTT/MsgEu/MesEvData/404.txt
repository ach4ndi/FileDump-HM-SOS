\u1f40\u1fb9\u1f48\u2135Today you're going to learn\u2328how the town hall works.\u2328Understand, Rahi?\u232b\u1f41\u1fba\u1f48\u2136Yes, Mom.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb9\u1f48\u2135Good.\u2328As you know...
\u1f40\u1fb9\u1f48\u2135Here we check in guests,\u2328help people move, and answer\u2328questions about the village.\u232bThe mayor's number one job\u2328is to respond to inquiries\u2328and look after the village.\u232b\u1f41\u1fba\u1f48\u2136As long as the mayor is\u2328around, the village is safe.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb9\u1f48\u2135That's right.\u2328Now, the guest rooms are\u2328this way.
\u1f40\u1fb9\u1f48\u2135Make sure you show the\u2328guests to the correct room.\u232b\u1f41\u1fba\u1f49\u2136There are only two rooms,\u2328so it can't be that hard.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb9\u1f49\u2135Well, that's true!\u232b\u1f40\u1fb9\u1f48\u2135Now for the library!
\u1f40\u1fb9\u1f4b\u2135We used to loan out books,\u2328but...
\u1f40\u1fb9\u1f4b\u2135Fewer people live in the\u2328village nowadays, and not\u2328many come by every day.\u232bIt's a shame, since we have\u2328such a great collection of\u2328books in our library.\u232b\u1f41\u1fba\u1f4b\u2136A real shame...\u232b\u1f40\u1fb9\u1f48\u2135Hopefully there will be more\u2328people who use it someday.
\u1f40\u1fb9\u1f48\u2135Finally, the meeting hall.
\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f48\u2136We use it for events, so it\u2328really needs no explanation.
\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f49\u2136Getting along with the\u2328villagers is an important\u2328part of the mayor's job.\u232bI'm always strict with you,\u2328but you can loosen up a bit\u2328when you talk with people.\u232b\u1f40\u1fba\u1f49\u2135I understand, Mom.
\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f49\u2136Look at the time!\u2328Let's go back inside.
