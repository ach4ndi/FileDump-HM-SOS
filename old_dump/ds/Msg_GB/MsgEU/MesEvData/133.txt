\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328\u21d0Women seem to want to marry\u2328someone out of a fairy tale.\u232bI don't understand it,\u2328personally.
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328\u21d5I'm really sorry,\u2328but I can't accept this.\u232bPlease give it to\u2328someone else.

\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328\u21d6I'm really sorry,\u2328but I can't accept this.
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328Did you get this for me for\u2328my birthday?\u232b\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f49\u2135\u21d0That's quite kind of you.\u2328Thank you very much,\u2328\u232a.

\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f4a\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328\u21d2Why would you give\u2328this to someone?\u232bThere's nothing in this\u2328world that I hate more.\u2328Don't give it to me again.
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328Soon, it will be our\u2328wedding. I can hardly wait.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f4d\u2135\u21d0I still can't\u2328believe that we'll be\u2328living together soon...
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328Is Dirk being a good husband\u2328to you?\u232b\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f49\u2135\u21d0I don't mean to treat him as\u2328a child, but as his brother,\u2328I am a little curious.
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328How is married life?\u232b\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f49\u2135\u21d0They do say that there's\u2328nothing more important than\u2328family.
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f4b\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328There's a typhoon today...\u232b\u21d6Days like this only remind\u2328me of painful memories...
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328\u21d1You look like you\u2328want to play outside.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f49\u2135You seem like just one of\u2328the children. 
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328I think that you're quite\u2328admirable.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f49\u2135\u21d0I'm really happy\u2328to have you as a\u2328friend.
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f49\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328\u21d0You're a very\u2328hard worker.\u232bI'm sure that everyone in\u2328town feels like they can\u2328depend on you.
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328You have a stall in the\u2328bazaar, don't you?\u232b\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f49\u2135\u21d0I want to be able to\u2328do something for this city\u2328like you have. 
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328Do you have any siblings?\u2328\u232b\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2135\u21d6Dirk's my brother, but\u2328I raised him growing up. I\u2328still can't stop worrying. 
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328All of the books here were\u2328my father's.\u232b\u21d0Many of them are difficult,\u2328but they're worth reading.\u2328
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328What's the matter,\u2328\u232a?\u232b\u21d7Ah, you're here for Dirk?
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328Is there something wrong,\u2328\u232a?\u232bDid you need something?
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328I know, \u232a. Would \u2328you like to talk sometime? \u232bOf course, we may be busy, \u2328but please just come by and \u2328see me sometime. 
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2135\u2008\u200e\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328I'm reevaluating how I view \u2328you as a person. \u232bI think you know exactly \u2328why. 
\u1f41\u1fa4\u1f48\u2332 I'm sorry... \u2328 Do what you want. 
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328\u21d6Can I really believe \u2328you? \u232b\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135No, let's just leave it at \u2328that. \u2328I may have been too harsh. 
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f4a\u2135\u2008\u200e\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328\u21d2What...? \u2328I see. \u232bIf that's how you feel, \u2328I'll do just that. 
\u1f41\u1fa4\u1f48\u2332 Ask on a date. \u2328 Do nothing. 
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f4b\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328I know you still have to\u2328work in bad weather.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f4c\u2135But I sometimes wish you\u2328could take the day off...\u2328\u21d5I guess I'm being selfish. 
\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328Good morning,\u2328\u2391.

\u1f40\u1fa6\u1f48\u2135\u232f\u206eIvan\u206c\u232c\u2328I should get some\u2328exercise... \u270a\u1f49Oh!\u232b\u21d1Maybe I could help\u2328with the farm work?\u2328\u232b...\u270a\u270a...\u270a\u270a...\u270a\u270a\u1f4cUm...\u2328Why are you making that\u2328face...?
