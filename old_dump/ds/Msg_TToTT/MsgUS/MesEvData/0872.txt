Ha ha ha!
\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f49\u2136Soba noodles taste awesome!\u2328I could eat three more\u2328bowls of the stuff!\u232b\u1f41\u1fad\u1f49\u2136Delicious! I think I'll\u2328have another serving,\u2328too.\u232b\u1f41\u1fbd\u1f49\u2136Eat up, everyone! Even if\u2328you get a tummy ache, I'll\u2328just fix you right up!
\u1f40\u1fb9\u1f49\u2135So, another year has passed.\u232b\u1f41\u1fbd\u1f49\u2136No one had any serious\u2328injuries or illnesses\u2328last year!\u232b\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f49\u2135It would be wonderful if the\u2328villagers remained in good\u2328health next year, too.
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f49\u2136I wonder what next year will\u2328be like. I hope I find a lot\u2328of new plants.\u232b\u1f40\u1fae\u1f49\u2135You really love plants,\u2328don't you, Reina?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f48\u2136I know! Seriously, right?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f49\u2136But maybe not as much as I\u2328love my horses, though!
\u1f40\u1fbb\u1f49\u2135More soba noodles!\u232b\u1f40\u1fae\u1f4c\u2135You're eating too much,\u2328Grandpa. You'll get sick!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f49\u2136She's right, Gombe.\u2328Think about your age!
\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f49\u2136Another year's over... But\u2328next year's gonna be even\u2328better for me and Hayate!\u232b\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f48\u2135You sure do get along well\u2328with Hayate, Kana.\u232b\u1f40\u1fae\u1f49\u2135Oh, definitely. They've\u2328always been inseparable.\u232bThat's never going to\u2328change, I bet...
\u1f40\u1fbb\u1f49\u2135Yun's soba noodles are so\u2328good! I could eat 100 bowls!\u232b\u1f41\u1fbd\u1f49\u2136They really are delicious,\u2328aren't they? I wonder what\u2328her secret is...\u232bHiro! Have her teach you\u2328how to make them!\u232b\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2135So again the cooking duties\u2328fall to me?\u232bDr. Ayame, I was hoping that\u2328next year you would pitch in\u2328with the chores more...
\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f48\u2136So the year is over...\u2328It was eventful, but\u2328good.\u232b\u1f40\u1fbb\u1f49\u2135Yes! It was a good year!\u232bOh, can we have more\u2328festivals next year,\u2328Mayor?\u232bI'm sure that would make\u2328next year even better!\u232b\u1f41\u1fad\u1f4c\u2136Hmph, you just want more\u2328excuses to goof off, don't\u2328you, Gombe?
\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f49\u2136I hope that next year is\u2328good to Konohana.\u232b\u1f40\u1fae\u1f48\u2135Oh, it will be, especially\u2328because we have more people\u2328living here now!\u232b\u1f40\u1fa7\u1f49\u2135Precisely as you say, Nori.\u2328It is the citizens who make\u2328a town good to live in.\u232bWe must all do our part next\u2328year!
\u1f40\u1fbb\u1f48\u2135Another year over, hmm?\u2328Well, I certainly intend\u2328to be around next year!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb9\u1f48\u2136I'm sure you will be. After\u2328all, what would our village\u2328be without you, Gombe?\u232b\u1f41\u1fbd\u1f49\u2136That's why I'm here! Don't\u2328worry, if Gombe ever gets\u2328sick, I'll fix him up!
