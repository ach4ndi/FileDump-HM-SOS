{CharName_27}! How can
you leave your bar!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How can the order
of things gotten so
mixed up... {32_19_136}{NextPage_49}
{50_22_0_0}I'm going to go home
and shoot off the
biggest firework {NextPage_1}I have just for
you, my friend!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27},
can we have a song? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm about to go
to sleep. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time for bed,
so pleas go home. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
G'night. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I need to be going
shortly. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really need to
get out of here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Bye. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pardon me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey there,
young man. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_9}There's nothing
here? {NextPage_49}
I guess you must
have sold out. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, well guess I'll
have to come back
next time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm just taking a
quick look around.
Don't mind me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is there anything
else available? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, never mind...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome to Forget-
Me-Not Valley. {NextPage_49}
I'm Kassey, the
best pyrotechnician
in the world. {NextPage_49}
Don't confuse me
with my younger
twin Patrick. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_7}Um...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_7}Just leave me alone
please... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_4}You, young punk!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_4}What do you want! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Afternoon. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Evening. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's a young'un
like you doing
out at night? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's a young'un
like you doing
out at night? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey young'un. {NextPage_49}
If you want to know
how to make
fireworks, forget it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing
out in the middle
of the night? {NextPage_49}
Me? I'm just
doing... things. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, young'un.
What brings you
here? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}Is that for me!?
Oh boy, oh boy!
That's my favorite...
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}Thank you so much.
You're not bad for
a young'un. {NextPage_49}
Can't wait to
taste it... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_4}How dare you!
{50_22_0_9}Humph... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}That looks good.
It makes me drool
just looking at it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, young'un you've
got something good...{NextPage_49}
{50_22_0_3}It must be for me
right?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}That's my weakness.
Besides young girls
that is... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_4}Don't show that
nonsense to me!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_7}Just looking at it
makes me feel sick... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_9}What is that?
I'm not interested
in that at all. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_4}Can you show me
something I might
like instead? {NextPage_49}
{50_22_0_3}Like a pretty
swimsuit model. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_9}Young'un.
Sorry, but I don't
really like kids. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_9}I guess he's cute?
I can't really tell. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_9}Young'un.
I don't really think
animals are cute. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_9}They're a pain, and
on top of that they
smell. {NextPage_49}
I don't know why
anyone would ever
want pets. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_9}Young'un, what's
that seed? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Grow some really
good crops okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Young'un, you
grew this?
Not bad. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks pretty
good. {NextPage_49}
Why not try growing
other things? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You brought this
from your farm? {NextPage_49}
Fresh milk always
tastes good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, young'un.
Got milk?
Ha ha ha ha! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Young'un, you
caught that fish?
Not bad. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You like to fish?
I like games myself. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You picked those
wild grasses? {NextPage_49}
Try mixing them
in your food when
you cook. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you like picking
wild plants? {NextPage_49}
Personally, I like
games instead. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is some good
looking food. {NextPage_49}
{50_22_0_3}Oh, is this for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
It really looks
good. {NextPage_49}
This won't be
enough for me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_9}Is this a good hoe?
Who knows? {NextPage_49}
I only know two
things expertly... {NextPage_49}
Fireworks...
{50_22_0_3}And pretty girls. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_9}Aren't you supposed
to use hoes in a
field? {NextPage_49}
What are you going
to do with that
here? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The more you use it,
the easier it gets
to use for you. {NextPage_49}
That's how all
tools are.
Understand? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_9}Is this a good
sickle? Who knows? {NextPage_49}
I only know two
things expertly... {NextPage_49}
Fireworks...
{50_22_0_3}And pretty girls. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_9}Young'un, don't you
use a sickle to cut
down field grass? {NextPage_49}
Don't go spinning
around here with it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_9}That's a watering
can... {NextPage_49}
I use those when I
have a fire while
making fireworks... {NextPage_49}
That's not enough
for me to use. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't spill any
water around here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_12}Young'un, what the
heck is that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}T-that's a machine
for milking? {NextPage_49}
{50_22_0_9}Oh, you meant for
cows? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_9}Young'un, those are
shears. {NextPage_1}I don't use them. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It might be good for
shaving someone's
head if they lost {NextPage_1}to me in a game
or something. {NextPage_49}
What do you think?
Good idea? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you use your
tools skillfully,
you can progress {NextPage_1}along your work
quicker. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_12}Oh! What's that?
{50_22_0_3}Is that for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_12}I don't know what
that is, but I'm
excited to see it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Young'un, those are
plants from around
here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Young'un, I don't
know a thing about
wild plants. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_12}Young'un is that
a frisbee or
something? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}I know!
It's for target
practice... {NextPage_49}
Just throw it in
the air, and I'll
shoot it down! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_12}Young'un.
What is that? {NextPage_49}
Does it have
anything to do
with me? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_12}That's a very
unusual object. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's Patrick's
firework. {NextPage_49}
He still can't
compare to mine. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is a good
firework. {NextPage_49}
Of course how can
you tell without
shooting it off? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that for me?
{50_22_0_9}...
It's not?{NextPage_49}
{50_22_0_4}That's rude. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going to
give that to
someone? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We live in the shack
and make fireworks. {NextPage_49}
I have a twin
brother, and I'm the
older one by the way.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We come from a long
line of traditional
pyrotechnicians. {NextPage_49}
That's why we're
the best when it
comes to fireworks. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Actually the truth
is that I was with
Patrick working on {NextPage_1}a 3 Meter firework
when suddenly it
went off. {NextPage_49}
We both fell down
into this valley. {NextPage_49}
We've been living
here ever since. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}The stuff you gave
me last time was
really great. {NextPage_49}
You're not bad,
young'un. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_9}The stuff you gave
me last time was
horrible. {NextPage_49}
Bleh! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_9}The {29_0}
you gave me before
was very bland. {NextPage_49}
You've got a lot
to learn still. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}The {29_0}
you gave me before
was really good. {NextPage_49}
I'll take more if
you get any. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}The {29_0}
you gave me before
was the best. {NextPage_49}
You're pretty
good, young'un. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}The {29_0}
you gave me before
was my favorite. {NextPage_49}
It was so good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_9}The milk you gave
me before was
alright. {NextPage_49}
You've still got
a lot to learn. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk you gave
me before was so-so.{NextPage_49}
I'd take more again
if you had any,
though... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}The milk you gave
me before was
wonderful. {NextPage_49}
Thank you and please
bring me more. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}The milk you gave
me before was the
best. Thanks. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_9}The milk you gave
me before was
really smelly. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}The milk you gave
me before was
really good. {NextPage_49}
Funny thing was
it smelled a
little. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}The cheese you
gave me before was
great. Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made the cheese
I had before, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}The butter I got
before was great.
Thanks a lot. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made the butter
I had before right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}The dish I had last
time was great.
Thank you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}The fish I had last
time was great.
Thank you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}The wild grasses
I had last time were
delicious. {NextPage_49}
Thank you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}That stuff you gave
me last time was
great. Thanks. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everyday you work
very hard. {NextPage_49}
Striving to become
the king of the
mountain. {NextPage_49}
You've become a
great farmer.
Well done. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You said you're
skilled at growing
crops? {NextPage_49}
Striving to become
the king of the
mountain? {NextPage_49}
Keep trying,
you'll get there. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You said you're
great at cooking? {NextPage_49}
Keep working hard
and then become a
great cook instead. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You work hard
everyday? {NextPage_49}
Effort is the
foundation of
success. {NextPage_49}
You're farm has
gotten better,
I can tell. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It takes strength
to grow good crops.{NextPage_49}
More than strength,
it takes effort. {NextPage_49}
Keep up the good
work. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you cook at home
often? {NextPage_49}
I've heard you're
a good cook. {NextPage_49}
Put all your effort
into cooking or
whatever it is {NextPage_1}that you ever want
to become good at.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you getting used
to farm work? {NextPage_49}
The real challenge
has yet to come. {NextPage_49}
Keep up the good
work young'un! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you gotten the
hang of growing
crops yet? {NextPage_49}
You're still young,
so you have time to
figure it out. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you gotten the
hang of cooking? {NextPage_49}
You're still young,
so you have time to
figure it out. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Young'un.
Which do you like
better? {NextPage_1}Girls or
fireworks?
{41_3_1}Fireworks.
Girls.
Both.
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}So you like
fireworks, do you? {NextPage_49}
I have a great one
to show you... {NextPage_49}
{50_22_0_9}But it's not ready
yet. {NextPage_49}
I'm researching a
new type of firework.{NextPage_49}
{50_22_0_3}You're not interested
in girls at all?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_12}You're my kind
of guy! {NextPage_49}
Now that I think
of it, you do look
like a pervert. {NextPage_49}
Not that that's
a bad thing! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_12}Both!
{50_22_0_3}Hah, now that's
the ticket. {NextPage_49}
They're both very
beautiful!
Ha ha ha! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_4}Don't talk to me
when I'm making
fireworks. {NextPage_49}
Even the slightest
mistake could
blow us both up. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_4}Don't touch that.{NextPage_49}
Even the slightest
mistake could
blow us both up. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You better watch out
if we play a game
and I win. {NextPage_49}
The slightest thing,
and I'll blow up. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be careful when I'm
not in a good mood. {NextPage_49}
The slightest thing,
and I'll blow up. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be careful when I'm
not in a good mood. {NextPage_49}
The slightest thing,
and I'll blow up.
...Not now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_4}The drinks here are
too expensive. {NextPage_49}
I'll go complain
to someone... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}I just love
{13}Moomoo Milk{17}. {NextPage_49}
You know what I mean
right, young'un?
Heh heh heh! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Griffin doesn't
really talk too
much. {NextPage_49}
I guess that's how
guitar players are. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Make yourself at
home, but I only got
one game to play. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just take a load
off, young'un. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}Grab a seat and
relax yourself. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}I really like
this place.
Don't you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}This time of year
makes me feel
so good. {NextPage_49}
I'd love to have a
huge party... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is the best
time of year for
drinking, eating {NextPage_1}and of course
wanton carousing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Playing games are
great because it
doesn't depend on{NextPage_1}the weather.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_9}I wonder what kind
of firework I'll
make next... {NextPage_49}
{50_22_0_3}I'll make something
the girls like. {NextPage_49}
I wonder what Muffy
likes...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_9}It's so hot and
humid. Whew...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Still, this is the
best time of year
for fireworks. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}Not hot...
Not cold... {NextPage_49}
Don't you agree this
is the best time
of the year? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}I wish I had some
good food and drink
today. {NextPage_49}
This season makes
me feel so
refreshed. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_9}It's so cold. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is a great time
of year to be in a
hot-tub with {NextPage_49}
swimsuit supermodels.
Of course that can't
happen here in the{NextPage_1}valley... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love the sea.
Do you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The sea makes me
think of fireworks. {NextPage_49}
Don't you think
so too, young'un? {NextPage_49}
You'll understand
in time... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks for coming,
young'un.
Let's play a game.
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
Come at me with
all you've got. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_4}So, running away
with your tail
between your legs? {NextPage_49}
Hah! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_12}That's too bad,
let's try next
time okay? {NextPage_49}
I can't right
now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}Time's up.
I win. {NextPage_49}
That's what happens
when you hold back
too much. {NextPage_1}Watch your time
next time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}It's my win. {NextPage_1}Maybe you were a
little too serious? {NextPage_49}
Sorry you lost, but
I'll challenge
you anytime. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}That was close.
I win this time. {NextPage_49}
I'll be waiting for
you to take your
revenge. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_12}What the!
I lost. {NextPage_49}
You really beat me
good there. {NextPage_49}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_7}How can it be?
I lost.
You're good at this. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_3}Whew...
It's a tie. {NextPage_49}
You're really good
at this, so let's
play again sometime. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Here's your reward
for defeating me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come back and game
with me again
sometime. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_22_0_0}Just remember,
next time you're
mine. {NextPage_0}
