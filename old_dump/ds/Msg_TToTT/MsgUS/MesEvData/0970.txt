\u1f40\u1fad\u1f48\u2135By the way, \u232a, that\u2328plant that was sick the\u2328other day is doing better.\u232bWould you like to come by\u2328and see it today?
\u1f40\u1fad\u1f49\u2135I'm home!\u2328Have you been a good little\u2328plant while I was gone?
\u1f40\u1fad\u1f49\u2135You're looking much\u2328healthier! Look how firm and\u2328green your leaves are!\u232b\u1f40\u1fad\u1f48\u2135.........
\u1f40\u1fad\u1f4c\u2135Ah, uh...I should explain...\u232b\u1f40\u1fad\u1f4d\u2135When you talk to plants,\u2328they grow better.\u2328All the research shows it!
\u2332 That's fantastic!\u2328 How weird!
\u1f40\u1fad\u1f4d\u2135You don't think it's\u2328strange?
\u1f40\u1fad\u1f4c\u2135Most people laugh at me\u2328when they find out I talk to\u2328plants...
\u1f40\u1fad\u1f48\u2135But you really don't think\u2328it's weird at all?\u232bYou must be a little weird\u2328yourself, \u232a.
\u1f40\u1fad\u1f49\u2135Ha ha ha!\u2328No, I don't mean in a bad\u2328way.
\u1f40\u1fad\u1f49\u2135Hey, I've got an idea. Come\u2328over here and take a look at\u2328how this plant's doing.\u232bCompared to when I brought\u2328it home, can't you tell how\u2328much happier it looks?
\u1f40\u1fad\u1f48\u2135Plants are a lot like\u2328people and animals.\u2328\u232b\u1f40\u1fad\u1f49\u2135They need love and attention\u2328to be their best.\u232bSo I check up on all of my\u2328plants and talk to them\u2328every day.
\u1f40\u1fad\u1f48\u2135If you'd like, you can stop\u2328by and check up on how this\u2328guy is doing again later.\u232bIf you talk to it too, it\u2328might get better faster!
\u1f40\u1fad\u1f4b\u2135Huh. Well, I'm used to being\u2328laughed at.\u232b\u1f40\u1fad\u1f4a\u2135And I'll remind you that\u2328what I'm saying is supported\u2328by research.\u232bWhile YOU have no basis for\u2328YOUR opinion.
\u1f40\u1fad\u1f4b\u2135I know I invited you over\u2328today, but I think that you\u2328should go home now.
