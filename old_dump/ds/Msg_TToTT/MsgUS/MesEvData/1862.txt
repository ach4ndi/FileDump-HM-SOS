\u2137Ahem! Gombe's critter\u2328catching class is\u2328starting!
\u2137Ah! Did you see that bug\u2328appear just now?
\u2137Most critters hide in the\u2328grass.\u232bWhen something surprises\u2328them, they jump out!\u232bWhen you spot a critter,\u2328get up close to it,\u2328and...\u232bBAM!\u270a\u2328\u206dPush that A Button\u206c!\u2328You'll grab the critter!

\u2137When you walk around the\u2328kind of grassy area critters\u2328like, one might jump out!
\u2137This time, my request is for\u2328a \u206fPiggyback Locust\u206c...
\u2137Walking around here is how\u2328you're most likely to find\u2328one!\u232bHowever, if you look and\u2328look, but just can't find\u2328one...\u232b...Move to the \u206dnext screen\u206c,\u2328then come back. It should\u2328show up again!
