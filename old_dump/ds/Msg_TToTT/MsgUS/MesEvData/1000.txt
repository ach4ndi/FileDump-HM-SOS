\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f48\u2136Huh? What's up,\u2328\u232a?
\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f48\u2136Ah, yeah.\u2328My dad made that wooden\u2328horse.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f49\u2136Isn't it awesome?
\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f49\u2136As a kid, I used to climb on\u2328that statue and pretend to\u2328ride. My dad would get mad.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f48\u2136My dad loves horses. He\u2328travels all over the world\u2328to find good horses.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f4c\u2136It's actually been a long\u2328time since I've heard from\u2328him...\u232bKnowing my dad, I'm sure\u2328he's doing just fine. But...\u2328I can't help worrying some.
\u2332 .......\u2328 I'm sure he's doing fine!
\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f4c\u2136Whoa, what gives?\u2328Don't clam up on me.\u2328Now you're making me worry.
\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f4c\u2136Uhh...If you're gonna be all\u2328withdrawn...\u2328I'm not into that.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f4b\u2136This is bumming me out.\u2328Sorry, you better go home.
\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f49\u2136Yeah, you're right!\u2328I'm sure he's fine!\u232bAnd he'll come home with the\u2328best horse in the world\u2328someday soon.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f48\u2136Anyway, getting all worried\u2328about stuff isn't my style.
\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f48\u2136You're really nice to talk\u2328to, \u232a.\u232bWhen you smile and say he's\u2328fine...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f49\u2136I feel like, yeah, he must\u2328be fine. I'm totally\u2328reassured.
\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f4d\u2136Um, so, like...\u2328What I'm trying to say is...
\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f48\u2136I mean...\u2328It's like this, \u232a!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa9\u1f49\u2136Hayate really wants to see\u2328you again. So I hope you'll\u2328come by soon.
