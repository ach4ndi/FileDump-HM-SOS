Well, we haven't even
discovered anything
major yet. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi. {NextPage_49}
...? {NextPage_49}
Huh? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi. I'm Flora, the
assistant.
Pleased to meet you.{NextPage_49}
Now, without further
delay I'll guide you
to the location. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is the entrance
to the {Location_43_41_23}. {NextPage_49}
We haven't made all
that much progress
yet... {NextPage_49}
But with your help
we hope to make
more. {NextPage_49}
----------x----------
Let me start by
explaining the
basics. {NextPage_49}
The A button lets
you dig a hole. {NextPage_49}
When you dig, you
may find items. {NextPage_49}
You can view your
items on the
Relic Screen. {NextPage_49}
Work goes until
5:00 PM each day. {NextPage_49}
If you want to quit
early, just get out
of the site.{NextPage_49}
One more thing,
you can't carry your
backpack while {NextPage_1}excavating so make
sure you eat up! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Should I explain
it again?
{41_3_0}Explain again
I got it already.
Nay, not really.
----------x----------
Thanks a lot.
That's enough for
today. {NextPage_49}
Oh, I'll take any
items you may have
found. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is this...!?
This could be very
important! {NextPage_49}
We'll check it out
later on. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can it be!? {NextPage_49}
Something important
might be written on
this slate! {NextPage_49}
I have to go tell
the Professor!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This isn't that
unusual. You can
have it if you like. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I dropped that
coin. {NextPage_49}
Thanks for finding
it for me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh?
I guess you have too
many things. {NextPage_49}
I guess you'll just
have to give up
on the other stuff. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh?
I guess you have too
many things. {NextPage_49}
I guess you'll just
have to give up
on the other stuff. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks for today.
See you again. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good job.
Are you done for
the day? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
You're still going
to work?
That's great. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is the inside
of the {Location_43_41_23}. {NextPage_49}
Don't push yourself
too hard now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let me show you
the way. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is the {Location_43_41_23}. {NextPage_49}
We've only made it
through halfway,
but with your help {NextPage_1}I'm sure we'll
do more. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is the {Location_43_41_23}. {NextPage_49}
Me and the Professor
have gone far, but
you'll still a help. {NextPage_49}
----------x----------
Shall we enter? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's too
bad... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}.
Let's stop for
today. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's hard to work
when the Professor
isn't around. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I'll take
a break.
Oh? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's unusual to see
you around here. {NextPage_49}
I'm Flora.
I usually help out
the Professor here {NextPage_1}in the {Location_43_41_23},but he
is not here today... {NextPage_49}
Wait a minute!
Would you be able
to help today?
{41_2_0}Leave it to me.
No way.
----------x----------
Really?
Thank you! {NextPage_49}
Don't misunderstand
me, I'm not planning
on playing around. {NextPage_49}
This is serious
work for me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Allow me to show
you the way. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's almost like
pictographs... {NextPage_49}
You can almost make
things out on
them... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, welcome.
You came to help
again today? {NextPage_49}
As always you'll be a
big help to us. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I knew that we
wouldn't be able
to understand {NextPage_1}anything with just
this little piece. {NextPage_49}
If only the Professor
were here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm?
The stone slate? {NextPage_49}
Sorry but we still
don't know anything
about it... {NextPage_49}
What's more
important is can
you help out again? {NextPage_49}
Can you? Can you?
{41_2_0}I guess so.
No way.
----------x----------
P-Professor!
Please calm down. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I-I guess. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Webbing... {NextPage_49}
We thought all this
time the fossils we
found were from {NextPage_1}the extinct
dinosaurs above
the ground. {NextPage_49}
I think it may be
more than we
ever thought... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Oh.
Maybe we've gone
too far. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good job.
I'll take any relics
you found. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Doesn't seem to be
anywhere we can
dig... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah.........
Ah.........
Achooo! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Excuse me. {NextPage_49}
The Professor and I
have been like this
for days now. {NextPage_49}
So, could you
help us out?
{41_2_0}I guess so.
No way.
----------x----------
Yes, Professor.
Just a little more,
I'll be done. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Done! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay.
Ahead of us is the
King's Hall. {NextPage_1}It's a sacred place
and supposedly any
who enter it are {NextPage_1}cursed with terrible
misfortune. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome.
Once again you've
helped us. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We found out what
was on that stone
slate we found. {NextPage_49}
Do you want to
hear what we
discovered?
{41_2_0}Sure.
Who cares.
----------x----------
The first slate
talked about the
{Location_43_41_23}. {NextPage_49}
Apparently the King
and his minions all
lived here together. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The second slate was
about their history. {NextPage_49}
Once long ago, there
was a great people
who lived here. {NextPage_49}
They were very
technologically
advanced. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The third slate has
mermaids drawn on it. {NextPage_49}
Those people's
lifestyle is
written on it. {NextPage_49}
Their staple food
was fish. {NextPage_49}
One day they caught
a huge one. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The fourth slate
talks about a curse. {NextPage_49}
It says how the
King's Hall is
up ahead. {NextPage_49}
Any who would
disturb him are
doomed to be {NextPage_1}cursed by horrible
misfortune. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see... {NextPage_49}
Well, if you want
to know what they
say, you can come {NextPage_1}and ask me about
them anytime you
want. {NextPage_49}
----------x----------
What's got you so
panicked? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're scared of
the curse? {NextPage_49}
Don't worry.
It's not like
you'll die. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, by the way,
we're about to enter
the Kings Hall. {NextPage_49}
There's a good
possibility there
are some amazing {NextPage_1}things to discover
there. {NextPage_49}
We need to stay
focused on our work.{NextPage_49}
So, will you help
us again?
{41_2_0}Sure, why not.
No way.
----------x----------
Oh, welcome. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, we've been
able to combine
all the slates we've {NextPage_1}found up to now and
learned something
new. {NextPage_49}
Want to hear about
it?
{41_2_0}Sure.
No thanks.
----------x----------
According to the
fifth slate... {NextPage_49}
A great tragedy
happened here. {NextPage_49}
The world was ruined
beyond repair and
they had no other {NextPage_1}place to flee but
above ground. {NextPage_49}
However, life above
ground didn't agree
with them, and they{NextPage_1}died out one by one. {NextPage_49}
They wrote these
5 slates as proof
they once lived. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's such a
sad story. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We've found the
final slate. {NextPage_49}
This apparently was
once a great temple. {NextPage_49}
It was built by the
ancient people. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, right.
We did find this
round looking item. {NextPage_49}
Apparently you can
listen to sounds
recorded on it. {NextPage_49}
It's like a CD
I guess, but much
heavier. {NextPage_49}
You can't put it
in a CD player
either... {NextPage_49}
You should try
finding a scientist
who can help you {NextPage_1}listen to it
somehow... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We too need to take
care of our world. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks to you, the
Professor's work
was a success. {NextPage_49}
The Professor wanted
to thank you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We'll be here for
a while so come
visit us again. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_0}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm? I guess we're
making good progress
at the dig.{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
I know.
I'm just taking a
little break. {NextPage_49}
I used to be really
good at doing this
in class too... {NextPage_49}
Don't tell the
Professor that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Time to go back.
Keep our secret
okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're welcome.
I didn't know Kate
liked archeology. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My story? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It seems so long
ago... {NextPage_49}
I came here when I
was Kate's age...{NextPage_49}
We can still fall in
love and be
fashionable here too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What? {NextPage_49}
I was just waiting
for the signal to go
back to {Location_43_31_23}. {NextPage_1}That's what I
always thought... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But, seems that I've
come to really love
this kind of work. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that enough? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay. So long. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{36_1}!! {36_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, it's only
you, {CharName_0}. {NextPage_49}
I thought it was the
Professor. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Huh?
Why was I surprised? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{33_1}{_90}............
{33_0}{_c8}............
{33_0}{_64}............ {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
S-sorry. {NextPage_49}
I took a necklace
secretly from the
{Location_43_41_23}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's not like it's
that important
anyway. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's the truth. {NextPage_49}
I'll give you one
if you keep my
secret okay? {NextPage_49}
----------x----------
Oh, Professor.
How are you? {32_3_232}
----------x----------
Okaaay. {32_3_232}
...? {32_3_232}
Huh? {32_3_232}
----------x----------
Huhhh...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}... {32_3_232}
It happened so
suddenly... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, can you
play a song for
{CharName_0}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}I'm going to bed
so... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}I'm going to sleep
soon, so would you
please go home? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}It's about time
I left. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}I really need to
get going... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So long... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}Pardon me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello?
Excuse me? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_25}There's nothing
here... {NextPage_49}
No, I'm not being
sarcastic when
I say that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}Too bad, guess I'll
have to come back
some other time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmmm...
Oh, don't mind me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't there
anything else? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nope, never mind. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}Oh, hello there.
I'm Flora. {NextPage_49}
I study archeology
with the Professor,
and I help out his{NextPage_1}dig over near the big
waterfall. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_7}...Hah... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_7}...Hah......
I'm fine. {NextPage_49}
Please just leave me
alone. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_5}Can I help you with
something!? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_5}...I said can I help
you!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}Um, good morning?
It is morning right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}Um, good afternoon? {NextPage_49}
I always think it's
night when I'm in
the dig site. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}Um, good evening? {NextPage_49}
It's hard to tell
when night falls
in the dig site.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}Oh, what are you
doing up so
late at night...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}What are you doing
around here so
late at night...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}Welcome.
You must have come
quite a ways. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}What did you come
here in the middle
of the night for? {NextPage_49}
Oh no, it couldn't
be that...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}Oh hello.
What's up? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_10}Oh my!?
Is that for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_10}That's great!
Thank you so much.
I'm very happy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_7}That's too bad. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks really
really really good. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got something
really good there. {NextPage_49}
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_10}Oh, you're giving
it to me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
That's really
nice... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_5}Gross! I hate hate
hate that stuff! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_5}I said I hate that
stuff! Don't even
show it to me! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_4}Ick, I can't stand...
No, I really hate
that stuff. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_4}I really don't
like that... {NextPage_49}
I don't think anyone
would like that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}Awwwww!
He's so cuuuute!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}Children are always
so cute. {NextPage_49}
I hope to have a
child too someday. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}Animals are really
cute . {NextPage_49}
Maybe I'll get a
pet too someday. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}Living animals are
cute, but I think
fossilized animals {NextPage_1}have a much deeper
beauty. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_12}What is that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_12}That doesn't look
like it's from
the dig site... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}You brought this
from your farm
you said? {NextPage_49}
It looks so fresh
and yummy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}I think it's a good
egg. {NextPage_49}
I'm sure it will
hatch a good
chicken as well. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_25}Did you pick that
from around here? {NextPage_49}
Grass isn't my
specialty... {NextPage_49}
I have no clue
what that is... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}I'm interested in
fossilized flowers
and grasses. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That dish looks
really yummy.
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_10}Is it for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
It looks so good.
Hee hee hee... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_12}That's a strange
looking hoe...
It looks heavy... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_12}You may think you
can use that at a
dig site, but in {NextPage_1}actuality, you
really can't. {NextPage_49}
There are too many
delicate things
that could break. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_12}Still, it is a
unusual hoe. {NextPage_49}
What in the world
makes it like that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}That hoe looks like
it's been used
a lot. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}It's amazing that
even digs anymore. {NextPage_49}
You should come
help us out at
the dig sometime. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_25}It's still very new.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}That hoe's life
hasn't even begun
yet. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}That hoe looks
quite used. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The more you use a
hoe, the better it
adjusts to you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}That hoe has been
way overused. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}It's amazing it got
as far as it did. {NextPage_49}
You should come help
us out at the dig
sometime. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_12}That's a strange
sickle. {NextPage_49}
Is it difficult to
use? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}It's unfortunate, but
sickles are useless
at a dig site. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_12}That's an unusual
looking sickle. {NextPage_49}
Where ever did you
get such a thing? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_12}Eeek, that looks
REALLY sharp... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}That's a strange
sickle, but as long
as it cuts, so what?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_25}That's a very new
looking sickle. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}That sickle's live
hasn't even begun
yet. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}That sickle has been
used for awhile. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The more you use
something, the
easier it is to use. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}That looks like it's
been used a lot! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}You're really working
hard in the fields. {NextPage_49}
You can tell by
looking at that
sickle. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_9}That's a strangely
shaped watering can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_9}Is that an ancient
relic? Noooooo.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_9}We can't use a
watering can at the
dig site. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_25}That's still very
new. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}That watering can's
life hasn't even
begun yet. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}It looks like it's
been used a little.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}That watering can
looks really used. {NextPage_49}
You should try
doing other things
besides farming. {NextPage_49}
Like helping us,
for example! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_3}Wow! That's really
been used a lot. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}You're really working
hard in the fields. {NextPage_49}
You can tell by
looking at that
watering can. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_12}Ah...
Are those shears? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_12}Aren't there any
tools that make
digging easier? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_25}That's very pretty
ore, but I'm not
into it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}I think fossils and
such hold more beauty
than jewelry does. {NextPage_49}
I'm not really
interested in
ores. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}We get lots of ores
when we dig, but
we're not geologists {NextPage_1}so they're utterly
useless to us. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_25}It's one of the
relics we found. {NextPage_49}
I don't need it,
but you seem to
like it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_9}That doesn't really
impress me... {NextPage_49}
I was expecting
fossils or stone
slates... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}You get lots of
those kind of things
when you did. {NextPage_49}
You can find out
about the history
of ancient people {NextPage_1}or ancient animals
with those... {NextPage_49}
Don't you find that
fascinating? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_25}Oh, a record.
That's unusual to
have here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}I wonder what kind
of record it is. {NextPage_49}
I want to try
listening to it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_25}What do you think
of the necklace?
Do you like it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can't you just feel
the ancient power
when you wear it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_4}If you don't take
care of that
necklace... {NextPage_49}
All I can say is you
better watch out! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I live with
Professor Carter
in the tent. {NextPage_49}
Is it strange that
we live together? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I help Professor
Carter with digging
and cooking. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He used to be my
old college
Professor. {NextPage_49}
Originally, I
wasn't into research
and such... {NextPage_49}
I just didn't feel
like working so
I came to help. {NextPage_49}
Let's keep that
our little secret
okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_10}The food you gave me
last time was
terrific. {NextPage_49}
Thank you very
much. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_2}I really hated the
food you gave me
last time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_2}I really didn't like
that {29_0}
you gave me. {NextPage_49}
Sorry if I seem
a little picky
to you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}The {29_0} I
had last time was
really very good. {NextPage_49}
Thank you very much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_10}The {29_0} I
had last time was
really delicious. {NextPage_49}
It was absolutely
amazing! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_10}The {29_0} I
had last time was
actually one of my{NextPage_1}favorite foods
to eat. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}The dish I had
last time was
delicious. {NextPage_49}
You're a very good
cook aren't you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}The fish I had
last time tasted
great. {NextPage_49}
I didn't know you
were good at fishing
too? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}The grass you gave
me last time was
delicious. {NextPage_49}
Thank you very
much for it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}Everyday you work so
hard. {NextPage_49}
You've become a
great farmer. {NextPage_49}
I'm amazed by your
drive to succeed. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}You must like work
in the fields a lot.{NextPage_49}
I'm amazed by your
drive to succeed. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}You're really good
at cooking. {NextPage_49}
Did you ever think
of opening your
own place up? {NextPage_49}
I'm amazed by your
drive to succeed. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you working hard
on your farm? {NextPage_49}
Keep up the effort
okay? {NextPage_49}
Don't forget to help
us out too! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you working hard
in the field? {NextPage_49}
Keep up the effort
okay? {NextPage_49}
Don't forget to help
us out too! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you working hard
at cooking? {NextPage_49}
Keep up the effort
okay? {NextPage_49}
Don't forget to help
us out too! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}Have you started to
get used to farm
work? {NextPage_49}
The real test has
yet to come. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}Have you started
to get used to
field work? {NextPage_49}
The real test has
yet to come. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}Have you started to
get used to cooking?{NextPage_49}
The real test has
yet to come. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_12}It's tough living
in such a small tent.{NextPage_49}
{50_28_0_25}I guess I've
gotten used to
it by now... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_12}I like archeology,
but sometimes I
don't understand {NextPage_1}what the Professor
is trying to do. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_12}Sorry to ask you
this here, but do you
like the dig?
{41_2_1}I enjoy it.
Total nonsense.
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_10}You do! Yeah!
Sometimes I wonder if
I like it here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_12}I thought so...{NextPage_49}
I didn't like it
either when I first
started... {NextPage_49}
Well, maybe I should
think of a different
way of life... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_12}Archeology is so
entwined in my
life now... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_12}I've been living
with the Professor
in this tent for {NextPage_1}a long time now,
but there are still
times I don't {NextPage_1}understand him at
all. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes I'd like
to just go on a
shopping spree {NextPage_1}and forget all
about the dig for
a while. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_10}Oh, you helped with
the dig? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}Oh, you're not here
to help with the dig?{NextPage_49}
Um, make yourself
at home I guess...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}Am I the only one
who thinks it's
comfy here? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}I can really relax
here... {NextPage_49}
Don't you feel the
same way? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}The flowers are
blooming nicely. {NextPage_49}
I love the way
Spring makes me
feel. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}Ahh... I feel
like doing something
new...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We're usually inside
a dig site somewhere
so weather doesn't {NextPage_1}really affect us
all that much. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The best feeling is
when you make that
big discovery. {NextPage_49}
That's exactly why
you need to help
us with the dig. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_9}It's hot.
We've got so much
work left to do... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_9}It's really hot.
I feel like I'm
going to melt. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}It's not really
hot or cold...
It's great... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}It's easy to make
progress during such
a nice season. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_138}{50_28_0_9}It's cold. {NextPage_49}
To make it worse,
neither the tent
or the ruin is warm. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_9}It's hard to make
progress in the dig
when it's this cold. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}Day after day
we dig... {NextPage_49}
It may look hard,
but we love it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_25}Once you get hooked,
it's hard to stop. {NextPage_49}
Especially once you
start finding
things. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_4}The Professor said
there's been a
suspicious looking {NextPage_1}guy hanging around
by the dig site. {NextPage_49}
Do you know anything
about that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}{50_28_0_4}Have you seen a
strange guy around
here? {NextPage_49}
If he tries anything
on me, I'll teach
him a lesson. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_25}
Please listen. {NextPage_49}
Every day the
Professor says
"Yum yum" when {NextPage_1}he eats anything
I cook for him. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_28_0_12}He may say yum yum,
but the truth is I'm
not a good cook. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_10}It's here!
Today, I prepared
present for you. {NextPage_49}
Why?
Well, just take
it for now okay! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_139}{50_28_0_3}What do you think?
It's my treasured
necklace. {NextPage_49}
It's a really
mysterious
necklace. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_140}Ah...um...
I can't take
it right now. {NextPage_0}
