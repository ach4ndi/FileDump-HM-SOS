\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f48\u2136Sorry, it's just not my\u2328favorite animal.
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f48\u2136Work, work, work.
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f49\u2136Ooh, what a beautiful\u2328feather! Where can I get\u2328one like that?
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f48\u2136Ooh, a gift? Sorry. I'd\u2328feel a little weird about\u2328taking that.
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f48\u2136Another gift today? Sorry.\u2328That's just too many.\u2328Thanks, though.

\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f49\u2136Oh! A birthday present?\u2328It's just what I was hoping\u2328for! Thank you so much!
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f49\u2136Ooh, this smells lovely.\u2328Oh, \u206dspring breeze\u206c?!\u232bThis is really for me?\u2328Thank you so much!
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f48\u2136Work, work, work.
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f48\u2136Work, work, work.
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f48\u2136What a treat to get such a\u2328nice birthday present!\u2328Thank you so much!
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f48\u2136Ooh, this is lovely!\u2328What? It's for me?\u2328Thank you so much!
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f48\u2136Oh, a birthday present?\u2328Thank you so much!
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f48\u2136Thank you so much!\u2328How nice of you.
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f4b\u2136What!? This is supposed to\u2328be a birthday present?\u232bAre you just giving it to\u2328me because you want to get\u2328rid of it?
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f4b\u2136Did I do something\u2328to upset you?\u232bWhy else would you give me\u2328something so awful?\u2328That's so mean!
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f4b\u2136Oh... This gift makes me so\u2328sad. What did I ever do to\u2328you?
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f48\u2136Work, work, work.
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f48\u2136Work, work, work.
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f49\u2136You look so happy now that\u2328you're married, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f4a\u2136I just hate typhoons.\u2328They can wreck houses, you\u2328know!\u232bHow can they undo my hard\u2328work like that? Nature can\u2328be such a jerk!
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f49\u2136I had so much fun making\u2328snow forts when I was\u2328little.\u232bMaybe I'll go make one\u2328today! That would be pretty\u2328cool, don't you think?
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f49\u2136I'm so glad we're such\u2328good friends, \u232a.\u232bI hope we can always tell\u2328each other everything.\u2328
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f49\u2136There is someone I have\u2328feelings for.\u232bHe's a little odd, but\u2328he's an amazing craftsman.\u2328Hee hee hee!
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f48\u2136People say I'm too reckless\u2328when I work.\u232bBut I hardly ever cause\u2328accidents! It just LOOKS\u2328like I'm being careless!
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f48\u2136Oh dear. I got hungry a\u2328few hours ago, then\u2328completely forgot about it.\u232bI've really got to remember\u2328to eat something when I get\u2328the chance...\u232bNot right now, though.\u2328There's so much to do!
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f48\u2136I have so much fun being\u2328a carpenter.\u232bIt makes me so happy to \u2328build the things I dream up.
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f4b\u2136Huh? Now where did I\u2328put that tool?\u232bHmm, it seems to have\u2328disappeared again.
\u1f46\u1fb4\u1f48\u2136Oh dear, what is it?\u2328Sorry, I'm a little busy.
