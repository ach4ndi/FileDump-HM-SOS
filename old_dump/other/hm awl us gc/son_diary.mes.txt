If I can't protect
my own precious
treasures, {NextPage_1}I'll never become
a real spy! {NextPage_49}
I've got to try
harder! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad's hands
were small. {NextPage_49}
I was really
shocked... {NextPage_49}
I've got to really
work harder from
now on. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A new friend came
to my room today.{NextPage_49}
It was a big bear
stuffed animal. {NextPage_49}
I think he's a
spy sent to watch
me though. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad bought me a
stuffed animal. {NextPage_49}
I'm too old for
stuff like that... {NextPage_49}
It's got to have
some strange history
behind it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A suspicious looking
stuffed animal came
to my room. {NextPage_49}
{CharName_36} brought
it, so it must be
some weird thing. {NextPage_49}
It must have some
strange past behind
it... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_13} is
so fast and cool. {NextPage_49}
I think I want to
be able to run fast
like {CharName_13} too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think that all
sorts of sports
are cool. {NextPage_49}
It must be really
neat to be an
athlete. {NextPage_49}
Too bad my Dad was
never one. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think it would
hurt if I jumped
from a tree. {NextPage_49}
Still, if I practice
a little more, I'll
be able to do it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think that I have
to train too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess if I want to
get lots of girls,
I need to work out. {NextPage_49}
But what the point
when I live so far
out in the country? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what brand
of running shoes
{CharName_13} has. {NextPage_49}
I get the weirdest
feeling from them...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't think my
clothes are made
for working out. {NextPage_49}
Especially those
big clunky shoes. {NextPage_49}
Could it be a good
training to wear
heavy shoes when{NextPage_1}I'm working out?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's important to
have a healthy diet
when training. {NextPage_49}
Protein is essential
for building strong
muscles. {NextPage_49}
I wonder what
{CharName_13} eats
every day? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your muscles react
to how they are
trained. {NextPage_49}
It'd be nice if Is
could move as
agile as a cat. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think a lot of
people have musical
instruments here. {NextPage_49}
I want a musical
instrument too. {NextPage_49}
But if I bug Mom,
then I'll end up
being scolded... {NextPage_49}
I'm a good boy,
so I'll be patient.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_20} is so
cool looking when
he plays guitar. {NextPage_49}
I thought how nice
it would be if he
played just for me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Grandpa {CharName_7}
said Dad is
tone deaf. {NextPage_49}
I wonder if that's
really true? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like instruments.
They let you express
what's in you. {NextPage_49}
Without a doubt I'm
sure they would
clear the fog that's{NextPage_1}inside my head now...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
These days, I want
to hear some really
hard rock. {NextPage_49}
Dad's records
just don't cut it. {NextPage_49}
Maybe {CharName_36}
will bring something
I like. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Music is said to
possess strange
properties. {NextPage_49}
I feel very calm
when I listen to
music.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's much better to
have a life with
music than without. {NextPage_49}
Everybody knows
that... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
People's taste in
music fascinates me.{NextPage_49}
I can see {CharName_14}
listening to
classical, but I {NextPage_1}couldn't imagine
listening to popular
music. {NextPage_49}
I guess certain
people convey a
certain image. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's hard to take
words and put them
into sounds. {NextPage_49}
No two people hear
the same sound
exactly alike. {NextPage_49}
I'd like to try
using someone else's
ears for a change. {NextPage_49}
I'm sure the it's
an entirely new
world of sound.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have a lot of
drawings I did when
I was little. {NextPage_49}
Problem is, I don't
know what I was
trying to draw! {NextPage_49}
Mom says they make
her all nostalgic.{NextPage_49}
What does
"nostalgic" mean? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today I painted a
picture of the sea.{NextPage_49}
At least that's what
I thought I did. {NextPage_49}
After looking at it
again I noticed the
color was off. {NextPage_49}
That was strange,
I thought. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_21} spends
a lot of time by the
rock thinking. {NextPage_49}
I thought that was
very mysterious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How can I express
myself? {NextPage_49}
I guess I have to
use art, right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lately, I've come
to like dark colors.{NextPage_49}
Black, silver...
They're both cool.{NextPage_49}
I wonder if I'm
depressed...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to try
drawing using a
female model. {NextPage_49}
I bet I could draw
the best picture
in the world if I{NextPage_1}could draw her... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what
{CharName_21}'s theme
is for his art? {NextPage_49}
I'm impressed that
he does all that
by hand... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if talent
is something that
you're born with {NextPage_1}or is it something
that humans are able
to develop? {NextPage_49}
I suppose "art"
is something that
should be natural...{NextPage_49}
Are humans just a
part of nature's
"art" then? {NextPage_49}
My head hurts,
that's enough
thinking for today. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's the
definition of an
artist? {NextPage_49}
If you think you
are an artist,
is it true? {NextPage_49}
And what exactly
is art? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It doesn't look
like {CharName_8}'s
cats can go outside.{NextPage_49}
I feel bad for the
poor little guys. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think our farm
is better if it
has lots of animals. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I saw a turtle in the
swamp today. {NextPage_49}
I was surprised by
how huge it was! {NextPage_49}
It must be good at
hiding because I had
never seen it even{NextPage_1}though it's that big.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today I've come to
realize something
about animals. {NextPage_49}
I think {CharName_8}'s
cats may be smarter
than me. {NextPage_49}
I really think
that's the case, and
I feel depressed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I saw an owl in
the woods today. {NextPage_1}Birds of prey are
really cool. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if girls
from big cities would
be attracted to a guy{NextPage_1}who was born and
raised on a farm...?{NextPage_49}
Probably not...
I'm too rustic...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if animals
react to how your
face looks. {NextPage_49}
This was just a
passing thought of
mine, but the more {NextPage_1}I think of it, the
more I think it
might be crucial. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if I'm
more like a cat or
more like a dog? {NextPage_49}
Cat...nope,definitely
a dog. {NextPage_49}
Dad is a dog too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I saw something I
haven't seen in
a while. {NextPage_49}
A lizard! {NextPage_49}
I can't help but
think of dinosaurs
when I look at them.{NextPage_49}
Did they evolve from
dinosaurs or did
they not? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_29}'s field
is filled with
various smells. {NextPage_49}
Sometimes it smells
really bad. {NextPage_49}
I guess you need
bad smells to grow
crops? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought I would
give {CharName_16} a
pretty flower, {NextPage_1}but she said she
didn't want it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today I found a very
interesting looking
leaf. {NextPage_49}
But there was a
bug on it, so I
threw it away. {NextPage_49}
I was a little
upset about that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today's Mom is like
a thorny cactus. {NextPage_49}
I've got to watch out
or I'll get hurt. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's important to be
able to honestly say
a flower is pretty. {NextPage_49}
I'm too embarrassed
to say it though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Does {CharName_30}
do field work? {NextPage_49}
Actually, I don't
see him working
very often.{NextPage_49}
It must be hard for
{CharName_29} to take
care of all that{NextPage_1}field work alone. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks like the
city has some new
technology that can {NextPage_1}be used out in the
fields. {NextPage_49}
I'd like to take a
look at it just
once. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's necessary to put
one's heart and soul
into grow good crops.{NextPage_49}
There's no other
way to do it other
than hard work. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What if crops grow
10 times as fast as
they do now?{NextPage_49}
I think it might
take some of the fun
out of field work. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_19}'s roof
is always shaking
around. {NextPage_49}
{CharName_19} is always
busy working on an
experiment. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like to study.
{CharName_16} said
she doesn't. {NextPage_49}
I thought that was
very strange. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today I made a great
discovery. {NextPage_49}
Mom's voice changes
depending on whom
she's talking to. {NextPage_49}
When she talks to me,
her voice is lower.
I wonder why that is?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lately all I've been
saying is "why",
"when", "how come". {NextPage_1}Somebody please
give me some
answers! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think {CharName_19}
is growing something
shady... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought I would
analyze cooking from
a chemistry angle. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm older now, but
there is so much I
have to study. {NextPage_49}
It's easy to get
sucked into the
world's mysteries. {NextPage_49}
One question makes
10 more questions. {NextPage_49}
That's what happens
when you accumulate
knowledge. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's fun to solve
problems. {NextPage_49}
I know why {CharName_19}
spends so much time
experimenting. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I need more books.
I've read them all.
I want to read more. {NextPage_49}
I wonder if the city
has more books...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad always seems
so busy. {NextPage_49}
But he's always so
nice to me. {NextPage_49}
I love my Dad so
very much. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad always seems
so busy. {NextPage_49}

Dad always seems

But he's always so
nice to me. {NextPage_49}
I love my Dad so
very much. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder which is
more important to
Dad... {NextPage_49}
The farm or me...{NextPage_49}
It's got to be the
farm. All he thinks
about is work. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think I'll follow
in Dad's footsteps.{NextPage_49}
I wonder if I'll
ever be able to
pull it off... {NextPage_49}
Nah...I'd never
be able to do that.
So frustrating...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Doesn't Mom
want to help out
Dad's work? {NextPage_49}
I wonder if they
just don't get
along... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lately I've been
thinking that Dad
is amazing. {NextPage_49}
I was raised on a
farm, so it's
normal to work here. {NextPage_49}
Dad threw away
everything to work
on the farm here. {NextPage_49}
I can't imagine how
much pain he had to
go through. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if Dad wants
me to follow his
footsteps. {NextPage_49}
...Yeah, probably
does.{NextPage_0}

It's too heavy for
me, but Dad is really
strong. {NextPage_0}

It's too heavy for

----------x----------
I wonder what Dad
thinks about {CharName_29}'s
farm? {NextPage_32}{_1d}
Never mind, adults
are always fakes
anyway... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Even though Dad
can keep more animals
here, whey does he{NextPage_1}put so much effort
into crops? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think Dad should
be working at a
vegetable farm. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad's swinging
speed is totally
incomparable, {NextPage_1}but he's getting old
so he needs to be
careful. {NextPage_49}
It looks like he'll
hurt his back. {NextPage_49}
Mom must think so
too... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think we can live
off of just our
crops here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad's swinging

----------x----------
Dad is really
good at cooking. {NextPage_49}
Mom is impressed
too. {NextPage_49}
I think it's cool
to be a guy who
can cook. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------

I think it's cool

----------x----------
I guess guys have to
be able to cook
nowadays. {NextPage_49}
Dad is pretty cool,
I guess. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad is good
at cooking. {NextPage_49}
He's definitely
better than Mom. {NextPage_49}
He should open up
his own restaurant. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
Watching Dad cook
makes me want to
try cooking too... {NextPage_49}
I didn't do so
good when I tried. {NextPage_49}
Dad is really
amazing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad cleaned a
fish perfectly today.{NextPage_49}
He's just the
coolest guy I know.{NextPage_49}
I could never
ever do that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Watching Dad cook
makes me want to
try cooking too... {NextPage_49}
I didn't do so

----------x----------
I think Dad is
rich. {NextPage_49}
{CharName_36} thinks
so too. {NextPage_49}
But then why does
he always wear the
same clothes? {NextPage_49}
I think it would be
okay to change
clothes sometimes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
I think Dad is
greedy. {NextPage_49}
Do we really need
that much money
here? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Money is important,
even out here in
the country...? {NextPage_49}
I don't know... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think Dad is
greedy. {NextPage_49}
Do we really need
that much money
here? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad has so much
money saved, so
he could just go {NextPage_1}on a trip with Mom
or something... {NextPage_49}
I don't know why
he doesn't go
on vacation... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad! You can't take
money with you when
you die! {NextPage_49}
I feel like yelling
at him nowadays.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought that we
have enough money
for a farm, but {NextPage_1}am I wrong...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad doesn't talk
a lot. {NextPage_49}
Sometimes he does
talk a lot though. {NextPage_49}
I wish he would
talk more... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad doesn't talk

----------x----------
I wonder why Mom
got married to Dad? {NextPage_49}
She's not the type
to want to be
married so much. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom looks pretty
young for her age. {NextPage_49}
Now that I think of
it, not many women
here look very old. {NextPage_49}
Maybe it's not
just Mom... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder why Mom
got married to Dad? {NextPage_49}
She's not the type
to want to be
married so much. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like {CharName_9}
because of her
attitude. {NextPage_49}
He attitude reminds
me of Mom's. {NextPage_49}
I don't think it's
normal to like a
girl older than you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------

I think Mom
will make a good
grandma... {NextPage_49}
I've got to make
sure I have lots
of children... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like {CharName_16}. {NextPage_1}Do I like her because
she's similar to Mom,
or she's completely{NextPage_1}opposite? It's
later, I think.{NextPage_49}
It's kind of funny
when I think
about it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what it
would be like
married to {CharName_16}? {NextPage_49}
What the heck am
I thinking... {NextPage_49}
I don't even know
is she likes me
or not... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom is always
telling me to
study, {NextPage_1}but she doesn't
teach me anything. {NextPage_49}
I wish she would

Mom isn't that good
at cooking. {NextPage_49}
Dad must have
married her because
he just likes how{NextPage_1}she looks. {NextPage_49}
Lately that's what
I really think. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom is always
nagging me. {NextPage_49}
I'm sure it's her
way of showing she
cares, but there's {NextPage_1}got to me some other
way to do it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if Dad
ever saw Mom
without makeup... {NextPage_49}
If he did, he
probably wouldn't
have married her. {NextPage_49}
Hmm, then I guess
I never would have
existed either?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_16} is a lot
like Mom. {NextPage_49}
Is that what I'm
attracted to...? {NextPage_49}
I wonder what she
thinks of me? {NextPage_49}
I get butterflies
thinking of that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad tells me I'm
good looking a lot,
so today I sat{NextPage_1}in the bathroom
and looked in the
mirror thoroughly. {NextPage_49}
I like just like you,
don't I, Dad... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Doesn't matter how
old Mom gets, she's
still absent-minded.{NextPage_49}
She always misplaces
something.{NextPage_49}
Some things never
change I guess...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Adults tell me not
to go to the Blue
Bar.{NextPage_49}
I want to become an
adult quickly. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was told today I
look like my Mom. {NextPage_49}
How can that be?
I'm a boy, and she's
a girl. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now and then Dad
goes to the forest,
eats a mushroom and {NextPage_1}then vanishes into
thin air! {NextPage_49}
I want to try that
too, but I'd probably
get in trouble. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was worried
because Mom seemed
to have a terrible {NextPage_1}nightmare the night
before. {NextPage_49}
I wonder what kind
of dream it was? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today I asked Mom
how she met Dad. {NextPage_49}
Mom blushed and
wouldn't tell me. {NextPage_49}
I can't believe she
wouldn't tell me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lately I've been
very impudent to
Mom lately. {NextPage_49}
I hate to say it,
but just looking
at Mom can get me {NextPage_1}really riled up. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad has been really
hard on me. {NextPage_1}I'm sure he must
think it would've
been better if I was{NextPage_1}never born at all.
(sigh)... {NextPage_0}

age where I should

a girlfriend. {NextPage_1}I'm really in a
mess now... {NextPage_0}
