\u1f41\u1fad\u1f4b\u2136I was afraid of this.\u2328It's looking unhealthy.
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Remember that plant I was\u2328studying here the other day?
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f4b\u2136I have come to observe it\u2328several times since, and\u2328it hasn't been doing well.
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136No help for it.\u2328I'll have to take it home.
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136There, I have the equipment\u2328that I need.\u232bI can examine it and perhaps\u2328figure out the reason it's\u2328unhealthy.
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f4c\u2136Look at this! The roots are\u2328diseased!
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136It will be okay, though.\u2328I'll carefully replant it,\u2328and it will soon recover.
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Hmm? What?
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Oh, you're wondering about\u2328all these books.\u232bYes, they're all my books\u2328about plants.
\u2332 Plants are fascinating!\u2328 Plants are so soothing!
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Yes, they are. Such a\u2328variety of interesting\u2328traits and adaptations.\u232bNo matter how much I study\u2328them, I never cease to be\u2328fascinated.\u232bAnd I still read about new\u2328plants being discovered all\u2328over the world.\u232bIf I search hard enough, I'm\u2328sure I can find a new\u2328species of plant.\u232b\u1f41\u1fad\u1f49\u2136Then I could be published in\u2328a major journal!\u232bBut who should I name the\u2328plant after? I shouldn't\u2328name it after myself...
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Oh, there I go getting all\u2328carried away.\u2328Sorry about that.\u232bBut I'm glad to hear that\u2328you like plants too,\u2328\u232a.\u232b\u1f41\u1fad\u1f49\u2136Perhaps we could...if it's\u2328all right with you...go look\u2328at plants again sometime.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136It's true, a lot of people\u2328find plants soothing.\u232bBut did you know that some\u2328plants actually sustain\u2328themselves by eating bugs?\u232bAnd some plants have poison.\u2328You know, \u232a, you have\u2328to be careful around plants.\u232bOf course, most around\u2328here are perfectly safe.
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Well, I have things to do.\u2328I'll see you some other\u2328time, \u232a.
