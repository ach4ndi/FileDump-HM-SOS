\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136...And then Dr. Ayame said,\u2328"It's too much trouble," and\u2328she put away the documents.\u232bAnd I said, "No, you mustn't\u2328do that!", but\u270a...wait,\u2328is...?
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136Oh dear! What a pickle!\u2328The books I borrowed from\u2328Town Hall are due today!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4c\u2136I utterly forgot about that!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136Oh, \u232a, you must\u2328excuse me. Because of that,\u2328today I must...
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136What's that?\u2328You'll come with me?
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136But...But surely you have\u2328your own matters to attend\u2328to, \u232a!
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Thank you! Thank you so very\u2328much! You're sure you don't\u2328mind?
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136I'm sorry to have kept\u2328you waiting.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136You seemed to be examining\u2328these books rather intently.\u2328Did you want to borrow one?
\u2332 Borrow medical book.\u2328 Borrow cookbook.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4b\u2136My! Are you so eager to\u2328do without the aid of\u2328Dr. Ayame and myself?\u232bUndoubtedly, one must care\u2328for one's own health...\u232bBut I do wish that you would\u2328place more faith in us...
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136I do apologize for taking up\u2328your time today.\u232bI have just recalled some\u2328other matters I must see to,\u2328so I will take my leave.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Oh-ho, that book!\u2328I have borrowed it myself!\u232bIt has detailed photographs\u2328and instructions. Very easy\u2328to follow. I recommend it!\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f48\u2136And the photographs of the\u2328prepared dishes are simply\u2328gorgeous.
\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f49\u2136Heh heh. This topic of\u2328discussion has made me\u2328hungry.\u232bI believe I will return\u2328home now.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa7\u1f4d\u2136Thank you ever so much for\u2328joining me. I'll see you\u2328again soon!
