\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136*Sigh*...
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136Oh, it's just...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136To be honest, my shop isn't\u2328doing too well lately...
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136And I think I know why.\u2328It's the way I interact\u2328with the customers.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136Unfortunately, I'm just not\u2328very good at it...\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136I want to fix that, but\u2328I'm not sure how...\u2328
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Huh? What is it?
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136You want to help me out\u2328with the store? Really?
\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136...\u232bWell, you're so good with\u2328people, maybe I'll learn\u2328something with you there.\u232bWould you mind helping\u2328out a little right now?
\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2135Huh? Oh, that's right...\u2328I need to drum up some\u2328business...
\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f48\u2135Um, let's see... C-Come one,\u2328come all to Cam's Flowers!
\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2135See, I'm just not cut\u2328out for this...
\u2332 Leave it to me!\u2328 You can do it!
\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f48\u2135Wow, with your help, we were\u2328able to sell everything!\u232b\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2135I don't think I learned\u2328much about dealing with\u2328customers, though...\u232bI just don't think I\u2328can do it like you do.
\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f48\u2135But you really helped me out\u2328today, and for that, I thank\u2328you. I'll see you later.
\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f49\u2135Th-Thanks for the support...\u232b\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f48\u2135It's so strange...\u232bWhen I'm with you, I can do\u2328things that I could normally\u2328never do...
\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f48\u2135All right, let's see what\u2328we can sell!
\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136Well, well! You two seem to\u2328be raring to go today!\u2328\u232b\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f48\u2135Oh, well, that is...\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136Hmm?
\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136You've really changed\u2328recently, Cam!\u2328\u232b\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f48\u2135Huh?\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136Even as a child, you never\u2328let your emotions show much.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136But lately, you seem a lot\u2328more animated!\u2328\u232bIt must be thanks to\u2328you, \u232a!
\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f49\u2135Well, if you say so, Mayor,\u2328then it must be true.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136Ha ha ha! Ah, to be young\u2328and in love...\u232b\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2135Huh?! I...I think you've\u2328got the wrong idea, Mayor!
\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136Anyway, I think I'll buy\u2328Rose some flowers! I haven't\u2328done that in a while now!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136I'll take this one here!\u232b\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f48\u2135Thank you very much, Mayor.
\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2135It looks like he got the\u2328wrong idea about us...\u2328Sorry about that...
\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f4d\u2135Oh, well, if it doesn't\u2328bother you, never mind,\u2328then! Let's keep working!
\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f49\u2135Wow! I never thought we'd be\u2328able to sell everything!\u232b\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f48\u2135It's all because of\u2328your help, \u232a...\u232bAnd I think I handled the\u2328customers better than I\u2328usually do.
\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f48\u2135I'm so glad I asked you\u2328for advice.\u232b\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f49\u2135Thank you, \u232a.\u2328
\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f4d\u2135Hey, want to stop by the\u2328cafÂ† on our way home?\u232bI'd like to buy you tea\u2328or something to thank you.
\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f49\u2135Great! Let's go then,\u2328\u232a!
