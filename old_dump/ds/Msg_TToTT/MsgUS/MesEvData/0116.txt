\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f49\u2136Oh!\u2328Look at this lively\u2328little guy! Ha ha ha!
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f4a\u2136Sorry, I don't like this\u2328animal. Show it to someone\u2328else.
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136Hullo, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f49\u2136If it isn't a blue feather!\u2328Haven't seen one of\u2328those in a while...\u232bSo you're getting hitched?\u2328Who's the lucky one?

\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136This smell...\u2328\u206dTomato fondue\u206c?\u2328That's for me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f49\u2136How'd you know?\u2328This is a favorite of mine\u2328Thank you!
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136Hullo,\u232a
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136Hullo,\u232a
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136Don't tell me this\u2328is a birthday present?\u232bWell, thank you very much!\u2328I thought only my daughter\u2328would remember.
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136Well, thank you!\u2328I do like this a lot!\u2328How nice.
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136Oh, a birthday present?\u2328Well, thanks a lot!
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136Well, thank you!\u2328I'll take it.
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136Now what's this?\u2328For my birthday?\u2328That just makes me sad.
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f4b\u2136Wh-What's this now? It's\u2328the thought that counts, but\u2328I wish you'd thought harder.
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f4b\u2136For me? Ugh. I can't eat\u2328this. What do you expect me\u2328to do with it?
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136Hullo,\u232a
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136So, life with my daughter,\u2328eh? She can be a tough\u2328cookie. I hope you're ready.\u232b\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f49\u2136Ha ha, don't worry. I'm sure\u2328you can handle it.
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f49\u2136It sure is nice to have\u2328someone to come home to,\u2328isn't it?
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136Now that's some wind!\u2328Hope the houses do okay.
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136I don't mind a little snow,\u2328but this is too much.
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f49\u2136You ever try horse racing?\u232bYou're such a natural hand\u2328with animals, I'll bet you'd\u2328be great at it!
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136I used to live in a village\u2328in the west.\u232b\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f49\u2136That's where Georgia's\u2328accent comes from.
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136Georgia says I eat too much,\u2328but ranching is hard work!\u232b\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f49\u2136I'll bet you work up quite\u2328an appetite too, right?\u2328Back me up on this.
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136Have I put on more weight?\u232bI'd better try to work it\u2328off, or I'll never hear the\u2328end of it from Georgia.
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136My horse doesn't take kindly\u2328to being ridden these days.\u2328I must be getting heavy.
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136This village is a good place\u2328for horses.\u2328They grow up strong.
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136You like horses, \u232a?\u2328Horses are great, and so\u2328are people who like them.
\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136Hullo, \u232a.

\u1f46\u1fb6\u1f48\u2136Hmm...\u2328Do you think I\u2328need to lose some weight?\u2328
