O-oh!
W-why t-that's just!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh dear.
I thought if I put another photograph on
top of it, no one would find it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
P-please, could madam be so kind
as to keep this a secret?
I would appreciate it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ahhhhh!!
Ms. {CharName_0}!
How long has Madam been there?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I-I'm sorry.
I guess I was just thinking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've been wondering recently.
I've been serving Miss Romana
for so many years.{NextPage_49}
I wonder how many more years I'll
be able to continue doing it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If anything should happen to me,
who would take care of Miss Romana and
Miss Lumina?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you!
Thank you, Ms. {CharName_0}!
You've made an old butler very happy!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Y-yes, I suppose so. It's just like you
say, Ms. {CharName_0}.{NextPage_49}
I'm such a fool.
I'm so ashamed of myself.{NextPage_49}
Please don't tell Miss Romana about
this.
Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh dear. I must have put
the second picture in by mistake...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why no. But it's
not hard to see why one would think so,
madam. It's actually Miss Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
M-Madam is very perceptive.
That is indeed a picture of
Miss Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wha-?{32_2_188}
Uh..............{NextPage_49}
!!!
Yes! Yes, that it is it precisely, Madam!
A picture of my mother.{NextPage_49}
It's certainly not a picture of Miss
Romana!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wha-? {32_2_188}Oh.
T-thank you very much, Madam...{NextPage_49}
I, uh...
I thought perhaps Madam was wondering about
the picture inside.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This was taken when Miss Romana was
just Miss Lumina's age and as Madam can
see, the resemblance is remarkable.{NextPage_49}
Photographs were still a rarity at that
time, so this is the only picture of
Miss Romana as a young girl.{NextPage_49}
It was taken as a lark, and somehow
it wound up with me. If Miss Romana knew,
I'm sure she would laugh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
P-please. Could Madam find it in her
heart not to mention this to Miss Romana?
{41_2_0}Sorry, buddy.
I understand.
----------x----------
Oh please, isn't there any way Madam
could reconsider?
{41_2_0}I understand.
Sorry, buddy.
----------x----------
Thank you, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...
Well, my own carelessness was the cause of
all this, so I must face the consequences.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, Miss Romana?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Very good, Miss Romana.
I shall do it immediately.{32_1_244}
If Madam will excuse me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have delivered it, Miss Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I left it on the shelf in Madam's
{Location_43_23_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well then,{32_1_244} I shall be going now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_2}Ms.{CharName_0}...
I never dreamed that Ms. {CharName_0}
would go before I did.{32_7_208}{NextPage_49}
Please leave young {CharName_1}
to me.{32_7_208}{NextPage_49}
I will do everything in my power
to help in this time of need.{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
Mr. {CharName_27}, would you be
so kind as to sing a song in
Ms. {CharName_0}'s memory?{32_7_208}
I'm sure Ms. {CharName_0} would like
it very much...{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
Oh, pardon me, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ms. {CharName_0}, could I trouble you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Oh dear, it looks as though
Madam is all sold out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, it's nothing.{NextPage_49}
I was just wondering if Madam might have
some foods that Miss Romana would like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, it's nothing.{NextPage_49}
I was just wondering if madam might have
some foods that Miss Romana would like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please don't mind me, Madam.
I'm just looking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmmm...{NextPage_49}
Sadly, Madam doesn't appear to have any
food that Miss Romana would like.
----------x----------
I don't suppose Madam has anything
else? They say that one woman's trash
is another's treasure. Hmmm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, what's this?
No, no that'll never do. Hmm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm rather fond of the {29_0}.
What is the price?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
How much is the {29_0}, Madam?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
{50_10_0_3}Well, that's quite reasonable.
Thank you, Madam.
...Hohoho...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see. That's unfortunate...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...I see. That's unfortunate...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Uh, pardon me Madam...
But I believe I've changed my mind.
If Madam will excuse me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}Well, if it isn't Ms. {CharName_0}.
I hope the farm is going well, Madam.
I am well, as usual.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_2}..............{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pardon me, Madam.
Oh curse my old bones. I'm just not
feeling very well today, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_4}Tsk. Tsk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_4}I'm terribly sorry, but I'm busy
right now. Could Madam come back later?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Good morning, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Good day, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good evening, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Why Ms. {CharName_0},
it is rather late, is it not?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why Ms. {CharName_0}...
Does Madam have business at this hour?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Why Ms. {CharName_0}.
Welcome.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What can I do for Madam so late at night?
{50_10_0_3}{34_1_63}Haha.{32_1_244} They do say
that history is made at night.{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_9}Or am I exaggerating? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Why Ms. {CharName_0}...
Good day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}Is Madam going to give that to me?
I must admit it is one of my weaknesses.
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}Oh, thank you, Madam!
I shall look forward to eating it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_2}I see.
Oh, it's no problem, Madam.
Pay me no mind...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Why yes, it's one of my favorites, Madam.{NextPage_49}
I prepare Miss Romana's food every
day, so I am somewhat picky about food...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}That looks most appetizing, Madam.
My, yes.
Very tempting indeed, sir.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Please come by the Villa soon, Madam.
I shall prepare Madam a delicious meal.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cooking can be quite complicated, Madam.
I always do my best to select the best
ingredients.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh. Madam has something very nice there.
Yes, I can tell.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That is one of my weaknesses.
Yes, it embarrasses me to say it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Hmm...
I'm not a very picky person, Madam, but
I simply cannot abide that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Hmm. I'm afraid I still don't like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}It's not as if I've never tried that...
But I'm afraid I just can't stomach it.{NextPage_49}
But please don't tell Miss Romana, Madam.
I am always telling her how one shouldn't
turn up one's nose at certain foods.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Oh dear...
I'm afraid I'm not interested in it, Madam
Pearls before swine and all that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}I'm afraid I'm not very
interested in that kind of thing, Madam.
It would just be wasted on me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}My my...
What a cute child Madam has. I can see a
distinct resemblance to you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But now that I look closer, I can
see a resemblance to Mr. Marlin as well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Miss Lumina certainly was cute when she
was this age, Madam. My yes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}My my...
What a healthy looking child. I can see a
distinct resemblance Miss Muffy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But now that I look closer, I can
see a resemblance to Mr. Rock as well.{NextPage_1}Yes, a very healthy child.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Miss Lumina was healthy and mischievous
at this age, Madam. My yes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}Of course!
Why, the child would be the perfect model
for my painting, Madam!{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_9}But that will have to wait until
my current project, “Flowers of
Forget-Me-Not Valley” is finished...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}Well, well.
What a well behaved child Madam has. I see a
distinct resemblance to Miss Nami.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But now that I look closer, I can
see a resemblance to Mr. Gustafa as well.{NextPage_1}Yes, a thoughtful looking child.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Miss Lumina wasn't very quiet when she
was this age, Madam. My no.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}Oh!
What an intelligent looking canine!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dogs have lived with people since ancient
times, sometimes as protectors, sometimes
as pets and sometimes as friends.{NextPage_49}
I'm sure this dog will become an
excellent companion for Madam in the
future.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dogs are wonderful, aren't they Madam?
I especially appreciate how they are
so loyal to their masters.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}How cute.
I'm more of a dog person, but I like
animals of all kinds.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I sometimes feel envious of Madam,
surrounded as Madam is by animals
every day.{NextPage_49}
I could take care of the animals and
occasionally draw pictures. Yes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, animals are nice, but I am quite
satisfied serving Miss Romana, so please
don't mention this conversation to her.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Is that a chicken from Madam's farm?
What a fine looking specimen. I'm sure it
will lay many delicious eggs.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If chickens experience too much stress, it
will affect the quality of their eggs.{NextPage_49}
They say that eating eggs from a stressed
chicken isn't good for one's health.
So please take good care of them, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a fine chicken.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}Why, what a cute little chick.
Take good care of it, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}What a cute little chick.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Well, now.
What a nice, plump duck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A long time ago in a faraway land, they
used to make their ducks nice and fat
before broiling them over an open flame.{NextPage_49}
I've never had that dish, but Miss Romana
says it is exquisite. I'd dearly love to
prepare it for her someday.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute duck, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}That looks like a fine seed, Madam.
My knowledge of seeds is sadly limited,
but even I can tell that much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}I hope it grows well, Madam. Good crops
make for good cooking, after all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Did Madam grow that on her farm?
Very nicely done, if I may say so. One can
tell its quality just by looking at it.{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_10}Oh, is it for me by any chance?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
It looks very good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are so many kinds of crops, sir.{NextPage_49}
Why, just once I'd like to use all
of them to make a feast for Miss Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Well now. Unless I miss my guess,
that must be milk from Madam's farm.
It looks quite fresh and tasty.{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_10}My goodness, is it for me?
Why, I do quite like dairy products.
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
Good milk makes good cheese, Madam.
I would dearly love to taste cheese made
from this milk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk is very fresh, isn't it Madam?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did Madam make that cheese?
Most impressive. Most impressive indeed.{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_10}My goodness, is it for me?
Why, I do quite like dairy products.
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}Let me be frank, Madam.
To make such cheese is most extraordinary.{NextPage_49}
I'm rather fussy about my cheese, mind
you, and even I will admit that this looks
like an unimpeachable specimen.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The taste of cheese varies depending on
the milk used to make it, but this is a
nearly perfect example of the art.{NextPage_49}
I would dearly love to make cheese fondue
with this cheese for Miss Romana,
just once.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ahem... Differences in the aging process
or the kind of mold introduced can result
in many different varieties of cheese.{NextPage_49}
There's Red Leicester, Tilsit, Caerphilly,
Bel Paese, Stilton, Emmental, Gruyere,
Norwegian Jarlsberger, Liptauer....{NextPage_49}
And then there are the more famous
varieties such as Camembert, Mozzarella,
or even Gorgonzola.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are countless varieties of cheese,
but they are loosely grouped into
processed and natural cheeses.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did Madam make that butter?
Yes, most impressive.{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_10}My goodness, is it for me?
Why, I do quite like dairy products.
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Yes, this is fine butter.{NextPage_49}
I would dearly love to use butter like
this when cooking a dish for Miss Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Butter can be very delicious in cooking.
But they say it isn't very good for
one's health, so use it in moderation.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}That butter certainly looks good.
I wonder what kind of cooking it would be
best with?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Is that an egg that one of Madam's
chicken's laid, by any chance?
It looks quite fresh and good.{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_10}My goodness, is it for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
There are many kinds of egg dishes,
all of them very delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Miss Romana is particularly partial to
my omelets.{NextPage_49}
She also enjoys my souffles, if I
do say so myself...
Does Madam enjoy souffles?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How a chicken is treated can certainly
affect the quality of its eggs.
But this is a fine egg. A fine egg...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Well now, did Madam catch that herself?
Very impressive.{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_10}My goodness, is it for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
No, I do not fish myself, but I select
and prepare fish almost every day
for Miss Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's see. With that fish, one could
stew it, fry it, or even eat it raw as
sashimi and it would be delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, that is a fine fish.
If it were I, I would make a lovely fish
stew for Miss Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Did Madam find that wild plant in this
area? That is certainly a fine specimen.
It should be very good in cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are many types of wild plants,
including some that are dangerous.
One must use caution when collecting them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure most of the varieties that can be
found in Forget-Me-Not Valley are safe.
{50_10_0_2}But one never knows...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is a very fine specimen.
I'd make it into a delicious rice dish
for Miss Romana.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}My, most impressive, Madam.
Ahem. I am a cook in my own right, and
this is quite well prepared.{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_10}My goodness, is it for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
Cooking starts with the selection of
ingredients, and includes preparation,
seasoning and presentation.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, it looks quite delicious.
I would love for Miss Romana to
get a taste of this lovely dish.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Is that a proper hoe, Madam?
I'm afraid I don't know much about tools.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Going to work in the fields, madam?
How delightful.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is it true that tools become easier to
use the more one uses them?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Is that a proper sickle, Madam?
I'm afraid I don't know much about tools.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_2}One mustn't swing such things
around here, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}That's Miss Romana's old watering can.
Does it meet with Madam's approval?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It may have a somewhat unorthodox shape,
but I assure Madam it is very easy to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}That's Miss Romana's old watering can.
Yes, of course I recognize it, Madam.
It has a most distinctive shape.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}That's Miss Romana's old watering can.
Do take good care of it, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, is that a new watering can, Madam?
I wish Madam good luck with her watering.
After all, farming is a noble profession.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That watering can has been gently used.
I wish Madam good luck with her watering.
After all, farming is a noble profession.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_2}Madam doesn't plan to water here, does
she? Farming may be a noble profession,
but there is a time and place for it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}What a well-used watering can Madam has.
I'm glad to see Madam has been working
hard on her crops.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's an old watering can, isn't it madam?
But I'd wager that it's very easy to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that device used for milking cows?
And to think people used to use their
hands for such things.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Milk is rich in calcium and very
good for one's health.
Good luck with the milking, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_2}I do not believe there are any
cows in this general vicinity, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Electric shears, Madam?
Those do look rather difficult to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Actually, when I was a child I always
had my hair cut with something like that.
Hard to believe, Madam?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Does Madam use those to shear sheep?
Please take care not to hurt
them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are new clippers, Madam?
Does Madam use those to shear sheep?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It appears that Madam has become
accustomed to using those clippers.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
One could use those clippers to cut
human hair as well. {34_1_63} I fondly remember
having my hair neatly cropped as a lad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}Those clippers certainly show a bit of
character. I'm surprised they are not
broken. Madam must be use them well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
New tools can be difficult to use at
first. And if one never breaks them in,
they will remain that way, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I always feel fresh and new when I
receive a new tool. Does Madam agree?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
One should use one's tools as much as
possible. Then they will get easier to use
and one will develop affection for them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Using tools well will improve one's work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}That tool has a rich patina of age to it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}When one spots a well-used tool,
one recognizes the mastery of the owner,
Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Is that a rare stone
by any chance? I'm sorry Madam, I am not
well versed in geology or gemology.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Perhaps if it were a rare stone or a gem
it would be valuable.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_3}My goodness, that is a rare find, Madam.
Collecting curiosities such as this is a
passion of mine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't suppose I could prevail upon Madam
to give it to me?
{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}Thank you, Madam.
I shall treasure it always.{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_9}Does Madam think that I have
unusual tastes?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}I see. I'm sorry
Madam, I shouldn't have mentioned
it. Please don't give it a second thought.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did Madam find that wild plant in this
area? It's quite a beautiful specimen. It
is good to have an admiration for nature.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have heard tell that the plants which
grow in this area have strange properties.
Unfortunately, I know no more than that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Some wild plants can be used in cooking,
but wild grasses are inedible, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a pretty flower, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}A record, isn't it Madam? Music has charms
to soothe the savage breast.{34_1_64} Yes, indeed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
May I ask what kind of record it is,
Madam? Oh, it's just that collecting
antiques is a bit of a passion of mine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Both records and the songs on them have
unique histories. If one listens to them,
one can see a glimpse of the past.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I used to listen to phonograph records
often when I was younger. And even now
I enjoy listening to classical music.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}My, that is a very rare spice, indeed.
Wherever did Madam find it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I would very much like to serve
Miss Romana a dish made with that very
spice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If I had such a spice, I would use it in a
wide variety of dishes.
Like what? Well, let me see.{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_10}Oh, dear. Just thinking about it
has made me all excited.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}Well, that is a rather mysterious sound.
As a matter of fact, Madam, one of my
hobbies is listening to classical music.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}Somehow that sound seems to make
one feel relaxed. Yes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_66}{32_5_220}Hmm...
That is a most unusual drum.
May I ask where Madam found it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, that is a very handsome medal,
Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did Madam win that in some sort of
athletic event? I myself have never been
so fortunate as to win a medal.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But if there were a worldwide butler
contest, I think I might have a chance
to do fairly well.{NextPage_49}
Pardon me for saying so, Madam.
But don't you agree?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hm. Come to think of it, I believe
I have seen that medal somewhere before.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My dear.
What an unusual necklace.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are many types of necklace, each
with unique regional and historical
characteristics.{NextPage_49}
I wonder where that particular necklace
could have come from.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Why, of course not Madam.
I myself have no interest in wearing such
a thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well now.
Isn't that the sheet music that
Miss Romana gave madam?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did Miss Romana give Madam that?
{50_10_0_9}One would think that Miss Romana did so
because she was unable to play it herself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}I'm afraid I am unable to play it
either, Madam. While I do enjoy listening
to music, playing it is beyond me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a firework, Madam?
An excellent specimen. I'm sure it will
be most beautiful when set off.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Fireworks produce different colors and
shapes depending on the gunpowder used.
Now I wonder what kind that is.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please do me the favor of informing
me when Madam intends set that off.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}What? A present for me, Madam?
No, no.
Such things would be wasted on me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Does Madam plan to give that as a
present to someone?
{50_10_0_3}S-surely not to me?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Surely Madam does not plan to.
No, I was just thinking out loud.
So, who is that a present for, Madam?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Madam is going to give that as a present,
isn't Madam? Why show it to me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have been serving Miss Romana for
over a decade now. But it has passed in
the blink of the proverbial eye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My father served in Miss Romana's
household, so I have known Miss Romana
since I was a young man.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I would like nothing more than to stay
at Miss Romana's side constantly, but...{NextPage_49}
{50_10_0_9}But Miss Romana seems to dislike
my being with her all the time, so I've
started taking walks around the Villa.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are a number of photographs
displayed around the Villa. They were
taken long ago by a man named Canot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}That item that Madam was gracious enough
to give me earlier was truly delicious.
I must say, I was a bit surprised.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}I'm afraid that this is difficult to
say, but the item that Madam kindly gave
me is not one of my favorites.{NextPage_49}
I'm terribly sorry, after Madam went to
the trouble of giving it to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}The {29_0} that Madam gave to me
could use a bit more work.
Please forgive me for saying so.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}The {29_0} that Madam gave me
was quite good. I'm sure Madam will think
it imprudent, but I would love some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}The {29_0} Madam kindly gave me was
divine. I have never tasted anything like
it. I am truly impressed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}The {29_0} Madam kindly gave me was
quite good. I'm sure it would be
delicious in any type of cuisine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk Madam gave me tasted most
nutritious. Yes, I'm sure that it was
quite healthy indeed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}About that milk that Madam
gave me. You must forgive me, but...
No, never mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Forgive me for saying so, Madam, but
I believe the milk Madam gave me could
still stand to be improved.{NextPage_49}
But they say a journey of a thousand miles
begins with a single step. I'm sure that
Madam is on the correct path.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk Madam gave me tasted
rather good, but...
Perhaps it could still be improved.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}The milk Madam gave me was the
best this butler has ever tasted.
I am rather moved, actually.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}About that milk that Madam
gave me. You must forgive me, but...
No, never mind.{NextPage_49}
But it might be rather good
made into cheese.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Forgive me for saying so, Madam, but
I believe the milk Madam gave me could still
stand to be improved.{NextPage_49}
But they say a journey of a thousand miles
begins with a single step. Perhaps the
best destination is among cheese.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk that Madam gave me had an
excellent flavor, but...
I believe it could still be improved.{NextPage_49}
Perhaps it would be best
if used for cheese.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}The milk Madam kindly gave me
was the best this butler has ever tasted.
I am rather moved, actually.{NextPage_49}
But I couldn't help but think that
it would be even better made into cheese.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk Madam gave me tasted quite
elegant, but perhaps it was slightly
weak.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}The milk Madam gave me was
quite good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}The milk Madam gave me was
rich and quite delicious.
I am impressed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}The milk Madam kindly gave me
was simply divine.
I am most impressed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}About that milk that Madam
gave me. You must forgive me, but...
No, never mind.{NextPage_49}
But it might be rather good
made into butter.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Forgive me for saying so, Madam, but
I believe the milk Madam gave me could still
stand to be improved.{NextPage_49}
But they say a journey of a thousand miles
begins with a single step. Perhaps the
best destination is among butter.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk that Madam gave me had an
excellent flavor, but...
Perhaps it could be improved.{NextPage_49}
Perhaps it would be best
used to make butter.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}The milk Madam kindly gave me
was simply divine.
I was most impressed.{NextPage_49}
But perhaps it was slightly
too strong.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}That milk that Madam kindly gave
me had a...
Rather distinct odor.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}The milk Madam gave me was
quite good. But...
It did seem to have a distinctive odor.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}The cheese that Madam gave me
was rich and delicious. It was, as the
French say, a coup de foudre!{NextPage_49}
Most impressive indeed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}Although that cheese Madam gave me
had something of an odor, it enhanced
its Mediterranean flavor. Delicious!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}The cheese that Madam gave me
is quite rare, is it not?
I understand these things, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did Madam make the cheese that she
gave me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}The butter that Madam kindly gave
me was rich and very delicious.
I am most impressed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}The butter Madam gave me had a
bit of an odor, but was quite delicious.
I am most impressed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}That delicious butter that Madam gave
me is difficult to come by, is it not?
I understand these things, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did Madam make the butter that she
gave me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}That {29_0} was simply fantastic.
Yes indeed.{NextPage_49}
It was like the proverbial manna from
heaven. I really must improve my culinary
skills for Miss Romana's sake.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}The food Madam kindly gave me
was quite good. But there is always room
for improvement, as they say.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}That fish Madam gave me tasted
simply divine.{NextPage_49}
That type of fish would be delicious
no matter how it was prepared.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}That fish Madam gave me tasted
quite good.
Fishing is a noble passion.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}Working hard, Madam?
That's most commendable.
Madam is a true farmer now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}I've heard that Madam is quite skilled at
growing crops. Madam must enjoy it. One is
most likely to excel at things one enjoys.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}I've heard that Madam is quite the cook.
How wonderful. I really must strive to
improve my own skills.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}Working hard, Madam?
That's most commendable. Yes,
Madam does seem somehow different now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}Does Madam enjoy cooking at home?
I have heard that Madam is well versed.
I must polish my own culinary skills.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It appears that Madam has become somewhat
accustomed to work on the farm.{NextPage_49}
Rome wasn't built in a day, as they say.
Keep up the hard work, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It appears that Madam has become somewhat

----------x----------
It appears that Madam has become somewhat
accustomed to cooking.{NextPage_49}
Rome wasn't built in a day, as they say.
Keep up the hard work, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Painting pictures is my hobby. Please
tell me... What does Madam honestly think?
{41_2_1}I don't have an eye for art.
That's a good hobby.
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Yes, I see.
I'm afraid there are not many who
understand me and my passion.{NextPage_49}
But thank you for being so
honest, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}Oh! Thank you so much Madam!
It does my heart good to hear someone say
that. I feel like painting again!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's not as if I've had any formal art
instruction and sometimes I'm not even
sure what's good or bad...{NextPage_49}
But painting does seem to relax me, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Perhaps Madam should try painting a
picture sometime. It can be most relaxing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Sometimes it can be nice to drink
in a place like this. Does Madam feel that
I don't fit in here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My favorite drink is the {13}Cherry Pink{17}.
Somehow it seems to be the one
that suits me the most.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_3}My, this is rather festive, isn't it,
madam? You must “drink up” as they say,
Ms. {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}Isn't this a nice relaxing room, Madam?
Of course, it's not as if it's my
house, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}Does Madam like the villa?
You are always welcome here. {34_1_64}Yes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_10}This place relaxes me.
I enjoy living here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}Madam seems to have taken a liking to
this place as well.
I understand. {34_1_64}Yes indeed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}This is a wonderful season, is it not
Madam? The flowers are blooming.
It makes me want to start sketching them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}This is a wonderful season, isn't Madam?
When one feels good, one works better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}This season is not my favorite...
This heat slows down one's work.{NextPage_49}
Whew.
{50_10_0_0}Don't misunderstand me, Madam.
My work never suffers in the least. {34_1_64}No.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}The wind does feel rather good.
In particular, the breeze blowing through
the trees offers respite from the heat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}This is the best time of year, I think.
Not too hot, not too cold.
One works best in this atmosphere, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_63}{50_10_0_10}The scenery is certainly pretty
when the leaves begin to change colors.
It makes me want to start sketching.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}It is a bit brisk, isn't it Madam?
This cold slows down one's work.{NextPage_49}
Brrrr.
{50_10_0_0}Don't misunderstand me, Madam.
My work does not suffer in the least. {34_1_64}No.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}I suppose a snowscape is rather
pretty in it own way.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Miss Lumina's mother was also
quite skilled at the piano.
I'm sure she is rejoicing in heaven.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_4}Miss Lumina is practicing, Madam.
We must be quiet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_4}Quiet please!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Oh dear.
You really must excuse me, Madam.
That isn't like me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}I tried to refuse, but she
wouldn't listen.{NextPage_49}
Imagine, Miss Lumina helping clean up.
She certainly is a kind young woman.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lumina certainly is a kind young woman,
isn't she, Madam? I mean that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Miss Kate said that she wanted to hear
my life story. But I hardly think someone
like me would be interesting to her.{NextPage_49}
But if I can be of some use to her,
I can think of no higher honor.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}Yes, it's is h-h-high honor indeed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_10_0_9}I'm terribly sorry, Madam.
Could I take that at some other time?
Please accept my humble apologies.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.................{NextPage_0}

----------x----------
Working in this weather must be hard.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Working on a farm must be rather
trying in weather like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm afraid I shall be
retiring to my room soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm afraid that it is time for everyone to
retire. Could Madam return tomorrow?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm afraid I have to be leaving
fairly soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm afraid I have to leave now.
If you don't mind, madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Goodbye, Madam.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How may I be of service,{32_1_44}
Miss Lumina?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome, Ms. {CharName_0}.{32_1_244}
I'm afraid there is something that I must
tend to, but please make yourself at home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have no quarrel with you, Madam, but
this is for Miss Lumina!{32_0_200}
Please step aside.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Here I come! {32_1_244}Aghhhhh!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
N-{32_1_244}No...
I wanted to give Miss Lumina the best
paintbrush for a present, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is the matter,{32_1_44}
Miss Lumina?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes. {32_1_44}By all means.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Does it meet with your approval?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see.
Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It does me good to hear that.
Please, take your time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is the matter,
Miss Lumina?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see. Please feel free to
come again anytime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is it,
Miss Lumina?{NextPage_0}
