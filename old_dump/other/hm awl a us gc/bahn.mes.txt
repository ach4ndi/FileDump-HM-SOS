All right, now give her a name.{NextPage_1}And you should decide where to put her
feedbox at the same time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Input_128}...That's a strange name...
Anyway, take good care of her.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
She seems to like you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll go ahead and put a free {13}{25_5_8}{17}
in the {Location_43_48_23}.{NextPage_49}
...Well, I'll be seeing you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah...
There are lots of expensive looking
things here, aren't there?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just looking is nice too, but there are
many things I'd like to have...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What! It can't be!
It's not possible!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've never seen a picture like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?! T-that's amazing!!{NextPage_1}So that means...
You bought it direct from the artist?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What! Could it be the Ronet who was one of
foremost artists of the surrealist school?
And as a female artist, she was a rarity.{NextPage_49}
Let's see, I believe her first apprentice
Romani was a man, though...
Oh yes, I need to see the signature...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh come on... Please...
I'd like to get a better look at it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How mean of you.
All right, the next time I come,
I'll bring a lot of money with me!{NextPage_49}
Take good care of it until then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll just leave it here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure your child will be very happy.
You can't find that kind of thing even
in the city, so take good care of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Anyway...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to get back to my business,
so you'll have to excuse me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you want to sell that?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
I can't buy that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK, will you take {2a_0_0}G
for it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
That's too bad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome.
How can I help you?
{41_3_0}Sell.
Buy.
Never mind.
----------x----------
What will you be selling today?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you need today?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm afraid you don't have enough money.
You'll have to work harder.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm afraid you have too many items.
You'll have to forget about it this time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you for your business.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's too bad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
An excellent choice.{NextPage_1}And you can milk this goat too.
I'll include the milker, so how does
{2a_0_0}G sound to you?
{41_3_0}Buy.
Never mind.
Discount?
----------x----------
An excellent choice.{NextPage_1}They say that this doll's expressions
actually change over time.{NextPage_1}If you buy it now, it's only {2a_0_0}G.
How about it?
{41_3_0}Buy.
Never mind.
Discount?
----------x----------
An excellent choice.
This is a valuable flower vase that
was made in a faraway land.{NextPage_1}Just this once, I'll give it to you for
only {2a_0_0}G.
{41_3_0}Buy.
Never mind.
Discount?
----------x----------
I'm thinking about
going somewhere outside the village
some time soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Incidentally, do you know about
Mineral Town?
I'd like to go there some day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...
Well, how does {2a_0_0}G
sound?
{41_2_0}I'll take it.
Never mind.
----------x----------
Hmm... I see...
Well, how about {2a_0_0}G?
Any better?
{41_2_0}I'll take it.
No, never mind.
----------x----------
Hmm... This is a pickle...
Well, how does {2a_0_0}G
strike you?
{41_2_0}It's a deal.
No, I guess I'll pass.
----------x----------
Hmm... You drive a hard bargain...
All right. {2a_0_0}G.
How's that?
{41_2_0}OK.
I think I'll pass after all.
----------x----------
You're really quite stubborn, you know.
This is my final offer: {2a_0_0}G.
What do you think?
{41_2_0}I'll take it.
I give up.
----------x----------
All right, please hand it over.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's just forget this ever happened, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...
Well, how does {2a_0_0}G
sound to you?
{41_3_0}Buy.
Never mind.
Can't you do better?
----------x----------
Hmm... I see...
Well, what about {2a_0_0}G?
Any better?
{41_3_0}Buy.
Never mind.
Can't you do better?
----------x----------
Hmm...
Oh dear, oh dear...
Well, how does {2a_0_0}G
strike you?
{41_3_0}Buy.
Never mind.
Can't you do better?
----------x----------
Hmm...
You drive a hard bargain...
Very well. {2a_0_0}G.
...How about that?
{41_3_0}Buy.
Never mind.
Can't you do better?
----------x----------
You're really quite stubborn, you know.
This is my final offer. {2a_0_0}G.
So?
{41_3_0}Buy.
Never mind.
Can't you do better?
----------x----------
All right.
I'll deliver it to you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All right...
Let's just forget this ever happened.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well then, I'll pay {2a_0_0}G each.{32_2_188}
You seem to have {2a_1_0} of them.
How many do you want to sell?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I help you with anything else?
{41_3_0}Sell.
Buy.
Never mind.
----------x----------
Thank you very much.
I'll have them delivered to your
place.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you very much.
I'll just put it in your chest.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well then...{32_3_232} Time to open Van's store.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All right...{32_1_244}
Come on everyone! I'm open for business!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well...{32_3_232} It's about time to close up shop.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's the end of another day.{NextPage_1}{32_3_232}...I guess I'll be heading home...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whew...{32_1_244} What about here?{32_1_244}
It's perfect for this room.{32_1_244} Whew...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's quite an usual item, so take
good care of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well then... {32_1_244}I should be heading back.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you for everything,
{CharName_0}.
I feel lonely already...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, a song please,
for {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Excuse me, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you want to sell something, it helps
if you have something to sell...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was in the market for something unusual,
but if you don't have anything...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm looking for unusual items.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Not much here, is there?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like that {29_0}...
How much is it?
{41_3_2}Today only, it's just {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
{50_36_0_9}{34_1_157}Hmm... That's still a little
on the expensive side...{32_1_244}
Oh all right, I'll take it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm... Can't you make it a little
less expensive?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a little expensive, but...
Oh, OK. I'll take it.
But you should buy something from me too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I'll have to pass this time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How much is that {29_0}?
{41_3_2}Today only, it's just {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
I guess I'll forget about it for today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please come to my shop
sometime, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello. I travel the world
selling lots of unusual items.
Come by and visit!{NextPage_49}
My shop is open on the 3rd and the 8th,
and sometimes other times.
Please stop by.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_7}......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_7}I'm tired today...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good morning.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good evening.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why are you out so late?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_10}Oh, that's one of my favorite foods.
C-can I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_3}Really?
Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_157}You've got something quite nice there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_3}You're giving it to me for free?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
In that case, I'll pay generously for it.
Please bring it to my shop.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...That's quite something.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think I'll pass.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's...not very valuable.
If you want to sell it, come to my shop.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_10}What a cute child.
I deal in toys as well, you know.
I'm sure you'll find something nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute child.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I recommend a toy for your child.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't deal in dogs.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't deal in cats.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't buy that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A duck can't keep its eggs warm
by itself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't handle that kind of thing, but
if you really want to sell it, bring it
to my shop.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come to my shop and I'll pay you for it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you want to sell it, come to my shop.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't have many food items
at my shop, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_3}Are you giving that to me for free?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_3}Well, thank you very much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I didn't think so.
You probably want to sell it.
Well, come to my shop later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you grow crops at your farm...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It would be nice if it were low-fat milk.
It would be nice if it were low-fat milk.
----------x----------
It would be nice if it were low calorie
cheese...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It would be nice if it were low calorie
butter...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Eggs have cholesterol in them
so I'm trying to avoid eating to many.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It doesn't cost anything to sell fish that
you catch. It's all profit. {50_36_0_3}{34_1_156}Heh heh heh.{32_1_244}{50_36_0_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make this food?
It looks quite good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_3}Can I...have that food?
{41_2_1}Of course.
You really shouldn't eat it.
----------x----------
{50_36_0_9}{34_1_157}That's very nice of you, but...
I'm on a diet. But thanks for thinking
of me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_9}I see... But you're right.
I'm not exactly slim, am I?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That food looks delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_9}It's too tempting. Please put it away.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe looks quite new.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an ordinary hoe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a worn hoe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That sickle looks quite sharp.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That sickle looks quite new.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an ordinary sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a dirty sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That watering can is quite new.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an ordinary watering can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an old watering can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milker looks quite new.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an ordinary milker.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an ordinary milker.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an ordinary milker.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those clippers are pretty new.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are ordinary clippers.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's quite an unusual stone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_157}Some people would get excited about that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are many different kinds of records.
I'll be getting more in later, so please
check back every once in a while.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an unusual necklace.
I wonder if there's a story behind it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_157}...Fireworks?
I don't deal in dangerous things
like that...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like finding unusual things, and
while I was doing that, I somehow ended up
becoming a traveling salesman.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you find anything unusual, please
bring it to me.
I pay well for those kinds of things.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I sometimes go to Mineral Town on
business and often see Won the salesman.
He has a shifty way of doing business.{NextPage_49}
But don't tell him I said that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear that the owner of the farm in
Mineral Town is saving up a lot
of money.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that {29_0} in Mineral
Town has walked one million steps.
I wonder if he's dieting or something{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The owner of the farm in Mineral Town
sure has bad taste.
He uses way too much gold...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The owner of the farm in Mineral Town
has three cottages.
Even though his family is small...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_3}{34_1_156}That food you gave me earlier
was really delicious.
So much for my diet. Ho ho ho.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That food you gave me earlier
wasn't very tasty.
It might be good for my diet, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me a while
ago... It tasted a little off...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_3}{34_1_156}The {29_0} you gave me a bit ago
was the best.
No, really!
----------x----------
About that milk you gave me a while ago...
It wasn't very popular.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About that milk you gave me a while ago...
People thought it wasn't bad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About that milk you gave me a while ago...
People thought it was pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About that milk you gave me a while ago...
People thought it was quite good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_3}About that milk you gave me a while ago...
People thought it was fantastic.
That must be the best milk in the world.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About that milk you gave me a while ago...
People said it tasted a little odd.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
People said that the cheese you gave me
was rich and very delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About that cheese you gave me...
People said it was smelly, but that
they could get to like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
People thought your cheese was OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
People said your butter was rich and
incredibly tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
People said that your butter was a little
smelly, but they could get to like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter you gave me a while back
was no ordinary butter.
It was quite exceptional.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
People thought your butter wasn't bad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_3}That fish you caught
tasted fantastic.
I ate it myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was told that the fish you caught was
not bad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You seem more dignified recently.
You are quite a successful farmer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They say that you have quite a green
thumb, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're working hard on the farm.
You look a little different...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
People are saying that the things you grow
are quite tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_10}Whenever I'm here on business,
I look forward to stopping by this shop.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm trying not to eat too many
snacks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whenever I come here, I end
up staying too long.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's quite a trip here to Forget-Me-Not
Valley, but it's all part of business.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It'll be difficult to sell as the
weather grows warmer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_36_0_2}...It's hot.... Whew!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sweating like a pig but
I still can't seem to lose weight!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Things are a little more comfortable
now that it's cooler outside.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The air here is much cleaner than in the
city. I love it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Even if it's cold outside, I end up
sweating on the trip here. Whew!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The snow doesn't pile up here, does it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Business isn't very good when it's cold.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are lots of nice things here
that I'd like to buy, but they won't
sell them to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Romana doesn't seem to have any intention
of selling the things in this house.
But I won't give up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't tell if Romana is a shrewd
businesswoman, or just mean...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't tell if Romana is a shrewd
businesswoman, or just mean...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I always stop here to see if Carter
will sell me any of his unusual
finds.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes very unusual things turn up
in the excavations around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you dig, too?
If you find something usual, I'll buy it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Business wasn't very good today.
I'm going home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with your business.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm thinking of going to Mineral Town.
They have some pretty interesting
things there, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This kind of weather isn't very
good for business.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It wasn't raining when I left
this morning...
Oh well!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My goodness! How wonderful!
I guess hard work pays off!
Ha, ha, ha!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_0}!
You came at just the right time!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was just telling Tim about the results
of the diet that Romana told me about last
month.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now I was a little skeptical
about the diet at first...{NextPage_49}
After all, you're supposed to put on a
blindfold and walk around flapping your
arms about twice a day...{NextPage_49}
But apparently modern science has
determined that this diet is the most
effective.{NextPage_49}
So I did that for 10 days and then
I stepped onto my new
bathroom scale...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And would you believe it!{NextPage_49}
{50_36_0_0}The scale read 80 pounds!
{50_36_0_10}I guess all of my hard work was worth it!
Ha, ha, ha!{32_2_188}
{41_2_0}Didn't it just go past 0 and start again?
Congratulations!!
----------x----------
Thank you, thank you.
I'm going to keep working on my diet!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe you should try it too, Tim.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm living proof that it works!
Ha, ha, ha!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I can't stand around here all day.
I have to go tell Romana...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll see you later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
............................
............................
............................{NextPage_49}
............................
............................
............................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I-I suppose you're right.
I thought for sure my diet worked
this time...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh well...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My goodness! How wonderful!
I guess hard work pays off!
Ha, ha, ha!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Given my failure with the last diet,
I was a little skeptical at first.{NextPage_49}
After all, you're supposed to put on a
blindfold and spin around like a top with
your arms sticking out twice a day.{NextPage_49}
But apparently modern science has
determined that this diet is the most
effective.{NextPage_49}
So I did that for 10 days and then
I stepped onto my new
scale for pets...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And wouldn't you know it!{NextPage_49}
{50_36_0_0}My weight had gone down to 199 pounds!
{50_36_0_10}I guess all those times I fell over
were worth it! Ha, ha, ha!{32_2_188}
{41_2_0}I think the scale only goes up to 199...
Congratulations!!
----------x----------
I'll stand by this diet! It really works!
Ha, ha, ha!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I-I suppose you're right.
I thought for sure my diet worked
this time...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll admit that my previous two failures
have made me wary of diets...{NextPage_49}
And it's true that this diet consists of
ramming your body against a thick piece of
wood 15 times, twice a day.{NextPage_49}
But apparently modern science has
determined that this diet is the most
effective.{NextPage_49}
So I did that for 10 days and then
I stepped onto my new
electronic scale...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And wouldn't you know it!{NextPage_49}
{50_36_0_0}My weight was down to 200 pounds!
{50_36_0_10}I nearly destroyed my house ramming myself
into the walls, but it was worth it!{32_2_188}
{41_2_0}Didn't you forget to put the batteries in?
Congratulations!!
----------x----------
I've had so many failures in the past,
that I was unsure about this diet.{NextPage_49}
After all, it consists of climbing up on
Daryl's roof and touching that sparky
thing twice a day.{NextPage_49}
But apparently modern science has
determined that this diet is the most
effective.{NextPage_49}
So I did that for 10 days and then
I stepped onto my new
imported made scale.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And what do you know!{NextPage_49}
{50_36_0_0}My weight was half what it was before!
{50_36_0_10}All those times I fell off the
roof were worth it! Ha, ha, ha!{32_2_188}
{41_2_0}Wasn't the scale just in kilograms...?
Congratulations!!
----------x----------
What with all of my failures in the past,
I was certainly skeptical about it.{NextPage_49}
After all, I was supposed to go to the
beach twice a day and scream at the sun
21 times while rolling in the sand...{NextPage_49}
But apparently modern science has
determined that this diet is the most
effective.{NextPage_49}
So I did that for 10 days and then
I stepped onto my new scale with all the
latest features.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And what do you know!{NextPage_49}
{50_36_0_0}My weight was down to 76 pounds!
{50_36_0_10}All that time I spent covered in sand
screaming was well worth it! Ha, ha, ha!{32_2_188}
{41_2_0}Um, doesn't that only measure body fat?
Congratulations!!
----------x----------
I've had so many failures in the past
that I was more than a little skeptical.{NextPage_49}
After all, I was supposed to have a
staring contest with Murrey every day...{NextPage_49}
But apparently modern science has
determined that this diet is the most
effective.{NextPage_49}
So I did that for 10 days and then
I stepped onto the full-body scale
that Romana gave me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And what a surprise!{NextPage_49}
{50_36_0_0}My weight had gone down to 60 inches!
{50_36_0_10}All those times that Murrey laughed
at me were well worth it! Ha, ha, ha!{32_2_188}
{41_2_0}Doesn't that measure your height?
Congratulations!!
----------x----------
I've had failure after failure, so you can
be sure that I was skeptical about this.{NextPage_49}
After all, I was supposed to watch what I
eat and exercise every day...{NextPage_49}
But apparently modern science has
determined that this diet is the most
effective.{NextPage_49}
So I did that for 10 days and then
stepped onto the old scale that
I had all along.{NextPage_0}

And would you believe it!{NextPage_49}
{50_36_0_0}My weight went down a little bit!
{50_36_0_10}It was worth giving up all those
ice cream sundaes! Ha, ha, ha!{NextPage_49}
{50_36_0_3}Oh joyous day!
Tim, how about a sundae to celebrate!
In fact, bring me a whole tray of them!{32_2_188}
{41_2_0}Won't that make you gain weight again?
Congratulations!!

Err... That... That is...{NextPage_0}

Aaaaggghh!{32_11_184}

Whew... Whew...{NextPage_0}

Oh hello, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_49}
{CharName_8} told me that if I could run from
the {Location_43_31_23} to the {Location_43_34_23} every day
I'd lose weight, so I've taken up running.{NextPage_49}
It's a lot harder than I thought!{NextPage_49}
I tried running from the {Location_43_30_23},
but I fell down and rolled all the way
to the inn. It was terrible. Whew!{NextPage_49}
Well, I'm off to the {Location_43_34_23}!
See you later, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I-I c-can't make it up these hills!{32_3_232}
Aaaaggghh!{NextPage_0}
