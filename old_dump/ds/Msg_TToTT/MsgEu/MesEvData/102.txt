\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Yesterday was pretty windy.\u2328You all right...?
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136It's pretty cute... I like\u2328flowers the best, but\u2328cats are nice, too.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136Is this your pet?\u232bUm... Could you make sure\u2328it doesn't get loose? I'm\u2328not a big fan of these...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136A... A Blue Feather? Wait,\u2328are you really giving\u2328this to me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Well, um, maybe we should\u2328go somewhere more private\u2328to talk about this...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Is that a Blue Feather?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136So you found your soul mate,\u2328did you? Congratulations!
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hmm? Sorry, I don't want\u2328that right now...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Thanks, but can you give\u2328this to me another time?
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Is this for me? Oh yeah,\u2328it's Harmony Day today,\u2328isn't it?\u232bThank you, \u232a.\u2328
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136For me? For Harmony Day...?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136Um... Are you sure this\u2328is for me...? Well,\u2328if you insist...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136What's that for...?
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Huh? A birthday present...?\u2328For me...?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136This soup... It's \u206dtom yum\u2328goong!\u206c I love this stuff!\u2328Thanks a lot!
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hey, isn't this \u206dtom yum\u2328goong?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136What? It's for me? Thanks!\u2328I love this! That's so\u2328nice of you...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hey, that's really nice.\u2328What? It's my birthday\u2328present?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136Wow, can I really have\u2328this...? Thanks!
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136That's for me?\u2328Really?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136Wow, that's so nice.\u2328Thanks.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Oh, for my birthday?\u232bThanks...\u2328
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136For me? Thanks...\u2328
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Is that for me? It's a\u2328birthday present, you\u2328say...?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136Well, if you insist...\u2328
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136That's for me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136Um... Thanks?\u2328
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136Um, I really don't want\u2328this, but I guess it'd be\u2328rude not to accept it...\u232bThanks.\u2328
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136How are you and Laney\u2328getting along?\u232bI bet she makes you\u2328delicious desserts\u2328every night, huh?
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136How's married life treating\u2328you, \u232a?\u232bMaybe I should settle down\u2328and get married, too...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f4a\u2136Boy, we're having a pretty\u2328bad storm today!\u232bI hope my flowers don't blow\u2328away... You be careful too,\u2328\u232a...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136You shouldn't be out when\u2328there's a blizzard like\u2328this.\u232bYou could be swallowed up\u2328by the snow!
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Do you like flowers,\u2328\u232a?\u232bI want people to know just\u2328how beautiful flowers can\u2328be.\u232bThat's why I work here.\u2328A nice flower arrangement\u2328can really warm the heart.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136A single flower is beautiful\u2328just by itself.\u232bHowever, if you combine\u2328them, they can become\u2328even more beautiful.\u232bThat's what I'm trying to\u2328find: The way to best bring\u2328out a flower's beauty.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I live in this village\u2328because of all the\u2328beautiful flowers here.\u232b\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136I love flowers. Don't you?\u2328
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hey, what do you think of\u2328Howard, \u232a?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136Don't get me wrong...\u2328I like him and all, but when\u2328you live with someone...\u232bWell, you know what I mean,\u2328right? They can sometimes\u2328drive you up the wall...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Have you ever tried one\u2328of Laney's desserts?\u232bI think they're really\u2328good...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136When you want to thank\u2328someone, give them a\u2328bouquet.\u232bMake it one of my bouquets,\u2328though, of course.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Do you have any flowers in\u2328your house, \u232a?\u232bFlowers are a great way to\u2328brighten up a place...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I'm not in the mood to talk.\u2328Sorry.
\u2332 I'm sorry...\u2328 OK...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136It's OK... Maybe I was\u2328reading too much into\u2328things...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136It was really bad out\u2328yesterday... I'm glad\u2328everyone's okay.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136A Harmony Day present?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136I didn't expect to get one\u2328of these after I got\u2328married... Thank you...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Huh? A birthday present?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136And you remembered what\u2328I like... Thanks...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Huh? A present for me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136You know exactly what\u2328I like... Thanks...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hey, do you want to go\u2328somewhere together?
\u2332 Yeah, that'd be fun!\u2328 I don't feel like it...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136I see... Well, that's OK.\u2328Just let me know when\u2328you're in the mood...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136What's that? It's a birthday\u2328present? For me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136Um, it's nice that you\u2328remembered my birthday\u2328and all, but...\u232bNo, never mind... I should\u2328be thankful that you\u2328remembered...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136What's that? A present?\u2328For me?\u232bUm, well, I appreciate the\u2328thought, but...\u232bWell, I guess I have to\u2328take it... Thanks,\u2328I guess...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Wow, you're pregnant...\u2328It doesn't quite seem\u2328real yet...\u232bIt's still pretty exciting,\u2328though.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136You've got the baby to think\u2328of now. You shouldn't push\u2328yourself.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I can't believe I'm going\u2328to be a father soon...\u232bWe have to think of a name\u2328for our child!
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136Seeing your face in the\u2328morning makes me feel great,\u2328even when I'm tired.\u232bIt makes me want to work\u2328hard for you.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I'm so busy during the day\u2328that we don't get to see\u2328each other that much...\u232bYou should come visit me at\u2328the flower shop...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I always love seeing your\u2328face after I come home\u2328from work...\u232b\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136All my worries melt away\u2328when I see you...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I've never felt like this\u2328before...\u232b\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f4d\u2136I've finally found something\u2328that I love more than\u2328flowers...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136When I'm at home with you,\u2328I feel like I'm in field,\u2328surrounded by flowers...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136We should plant some flowers\u2328in our flower beds here at\u2328the house...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Marriage is all about making\u2328our dreams come true\u2328together...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Maybe I'm wrong, but it\u2328feels like you've changed\u2328since we got married...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136Is this really what marriage\u2328is supposed to feel like...?
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f4a\u2136...What?
\u2332 Please don't be angry...\u2328 Never mind...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I'm not angry... It's\u2328just that...\u232bNo, it's OK...\u2328Never mind...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f4a\u2136Never mind? If you have\u2328something to say to me,\u2328you should say it...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Aren't you bringing that to\u2328the festival today?
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Is this your pet?\u2328How cute...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136You're a cute one,\u2328aren't you?
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136Where'd you get that\u2328thing...? Can you please\u2328get it away from me?
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136You should really let that\u2328poor thing go...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136That's a nice outfit.\u2328I really like it.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a, do you\u2328want to go hang out\u2328somewhere?
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Would you like to go\u2328somewhere and talk,\u2328\u232a?
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Would you like to go\u2328for a walk with me,\u2328\u232a?
\u2332 Sure!\u2328 Not really...
\u2332 Sounds good!\u2328 Maybe some other time?
\u2332 Sure! Let's go!\u2328 Not right now...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136Oh, OK...\u232bNo, don't worry about it...\u2328
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136OK, we'll do it some\u2328other time, then.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Oh, I see... Maybe sometime\u2328later when you're free?
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136It's Flower Day, so I'm\u2328really busy today.\u2328...\u270a\u270aWhat? A flower for me?\u232b\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136Thank you very much. I'll\u2328make sure to keep this\u2328flower in a safe place!
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136Ah, that's right, it's\u2328Flower Day today! Thank\u2328you so much!
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Tomorrow is the Starry Night\u2328Festival. Do you want to\u2328go with me?
\u2332 Sounds fun!\u2328 I'm sorry...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136Really? Great. I'll be at\u2328the cafÂ† around 8 PM\u2328tomorrow.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I see... Don't worry about\u2328it. It's fine...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I'll see you tomorrow, then.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136This wrapping paper is\u2328really nice... I wonder\u2328what's inside...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136I always feel at peace when\u2328I'm with you...\u232b\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f4d\u2136I guess what I mean is that\u2328you're a really important\u2328person in my life, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Sorry, but could you leave\u2328me alone today...?
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Since it's Flower Day today,\u2328I sold a lot of flowers.\u232bI think it's great that we\u2328have a day when we give\u2328people flowers.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136Make yourself at home.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I'm a bit busy today, but\u2328make yourself at home.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I'm on my way to work now.\u2328You work hard, too...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Oh, you came to get me?\u2328Thanks...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136On my days off, I like\u2328to take a walk here.\u2328It's so peaceful.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Now that the tunnel is open,\u2328I'd like to sell flowers\u2328in Konohana, too.\u232b\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f4c\u2136But I don't know where\u2328to set up shop there,\u2328though...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.

\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f4b\u2136I'd like to be alone today.\u2328Sorry...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136What do you think of\u2328Konohana's food?\u232bPersonally, I like the\u2328food here better...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136So I heard you cheered us\u2328on today... Thanks...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Konohana's food looks pretty\u2328good, but I still like our\u2328village's food best.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi,\u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Sorry you didn't win today.\u2328Don't worry about it,\u2328though.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136The \u1000\u2328is today. Are you going? It\u2328should be a lot of fun!
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136So you didn't come to the\u2328\u1000\u2328today? It was a lot of fun.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.

\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Good evening. You all\u2328done with work?
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a. Good\u2328evening. What are you\u232bdoing out so late?
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136I can't believe we're\u2328getting married soon... It's\u2328like a dream come true...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Let me make your wedding\u2328bouquet. I'll make sure it\u2328suits you perfectly.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f4d\u2136I'm kind of nervous about\u2328the wedding... Everyone\u2328will be watching us...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Like us, flowers have many\u2328different moods...\u232bTheir petals change\u2328depending on how they\u2328are feeling...
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I've got lots of beautiful\u2328flowers for sale here.\u232bYou can buy some seeds and\u2328raise your own flowers if\u2328you'd like, though.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I personally grow and select\u2328each flower I sell here.\u232bThat's why every flower here\u2328is not only beautiful, but\u2328also freshly cut.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Hi, \u232a.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136I feel so relaxed here.\u2328
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136Do you come here often?\u2328
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f48\u2136To grow flowers, you need\u2328love and a gentle touch.
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136Good morning. Did you sleep\u2328well?
\u1f46\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136Good morning. I feel great\u2328today.
