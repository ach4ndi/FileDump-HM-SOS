How was it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Bartender,
do you mind if I play
a song with you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks, man.
All right, a song just for you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, what have we here?
It looks like we've got a new friend.{NextPage_49}
Come, come.
No need to be shy, man.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come right over here, if you don't mind.
{41_2_0}With pleasure
I'm sorry.
----------x----------
Well, what about over there?
{41_2_0}Yes.
I'm going home.
----------x----------
I see....
Well, if you get the urge, feel free to
come back any time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now then,
I'd like to dedicate this next song
to our new guest.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, that's about it for
today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}{34_1_102}Hey {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you mean, what am I doing?
Hey man, just look up at that sky!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Look at those stars just a
sparklin' up there...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
In one of the countries I visited, they
had a special festival just for enjoying
the starry night sky.{NextPage_49}
I'd like everybody to be able to
appreciate this kind of beauty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_7}Oh, {CharName_4}...{32_7_208}{50_20_0_0}{NextPage_49}
You were quite a heroine
to me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}Sigh...{32_3_232}
{50_20_0_7}{CharName_4}...
Where could you be?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_4}{36_1}Where are you?{36_0}{32_5_220}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_0}Oh! {CharName_4}!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_0}{CharName_4}, you've come back!
Groovy!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}What a relief!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}In honor of our reunion, let me
play a little song!!{NextPage_49}
....{32_3_232}{50_20_0_0}Hm?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}I just like singing.{NextPage_49}
Say, you want to sing with me, man?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}It's OK.
It's simple. You'll learn it in no time.
Just follow my lead.{NextPage_49}
{32_3_232}Here we go...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
♪Long ago....... By a spring........
Two young girls.....
Learned of the happiness love brings.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't look at me...{52_0_0_0}
{39_1}{50_20_0_3}That was {CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}That kid's got a gift for music.
To be able to remember a song so well
after only hearing it once is impressive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}All right! Groovy!
Live music is the best!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That was just great.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey man, {32_1_244}what's shakin'?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know, {32_1_44}I found something kind of
strange on the beach a while ago.{32_1_244}
I think it's some kinda sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know what it was doing on the
beach, but.{32_0_200}.{32_0_200}.{32_0_200} I bet it washed up
from somewhere far away.{NextPage_49}
I don't have any use for it, so you
can have it.
I bet you can use it on your farm, man.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
With instruments or tools, the more you
use them, the better they get.{NextPage_49}
It looks kind of old, but I bet it's
pretty easy to use...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}{34_1_102}Hey. {32_1_244}Good timing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We're about to start the Summer Festival.{32_1_244}
People should be coming pretty soon.
Are you coming, {CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess everybody's here.{32_1_244}
All right then... {32_1_244}Let's party.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks for coming everyone.{32_3_232}
See you all next year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The Starry Night Festival's about to
start.{32_1_244} People should be coming pretty
soon. Are you coming, {CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0},
this isn't goodbye.
We'll meet again on the other side.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, I'd like to sing something for her.
Would you mind accompanying me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you're all sold old?
Don't worry about it, man...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll just come back later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm just looking here, man.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Not much here that I want...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That {29_0} looks pretty groovy.
How much bread do you want for it, man?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G, man.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
Not a bad price.
All right, lay it on me, man.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All right, lay it on me, man.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a little expensive...
But, it's only money, right man?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}...Oh, OK. No sweat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How much for the {29_0}?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G, man.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
I'm just gonna look a little more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh yeah, you're the gal from the farm.
How's farm life treatin' you?
Come by and see me any time, man.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}I guess I've got the
blues today...
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}Could you just leave me alone...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_4}Don't you ever get angry for no reason?
Well that's how I feel now, man.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_4}...What do you want?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_102}Peace, sister.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_102}What are you doing out so late, man?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_102}What are you doing out so late, man?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}Wow, that looks delectable.
Is it for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}Really...?
Groovy man. Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}Oh... I see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}Hey, you've got something nice there.
Is it for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
That's pretty nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}You expect me to eat that?
Sorry, man.
I just can't stand that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}That's just not my bag, man.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that, man?
I'm not really into that whole scene...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you just put that away?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}Cute kid.
Looks a bit like you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cute kid.
I hope we can sing together
sometime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cute dog.
He's got an interesting face, now
that I look at it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good dog.
Speak!{34_0_211}{32_3_232}
Ruff ruff!{34_0_211}{32_3_232}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cute dog.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, how's it goin' kitty?{34_0_197}{32_3_232}
Well that's good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cute cat.{34_0_197}{32_3_232}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Chasing chickens can be pretty
fun, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cute chicken.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you think chickens really lay golden
eggs? I think it's just some kind of story
made up by the bourgeois ruling class. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ducks are pretty cool.
I love that funny walk of theirs.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The more I stare at it, the
more trippy this duck's face looks, man.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what kind of plant those
seeds will grow into...
Hey, could I have that?
{41_2_1}Sure.
No.
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}Really?{NextPage_49}
{50_20_0_9}No, I'd better not. I got into
growing my own plants in the past.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yeah, I guess not.
You probably need that, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to try growing crops and
working on a farm...
But I don't think it's for me, you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of seed could that be?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you grow that on your farm?
How about giving me some sometimes?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, is it for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
This is organic, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The kind of milk you use will affect
the taste of the cheese.
But I guess that's common sense.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that butter on your farm?
I bet it's good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess there are some types of milk
that are best for butter.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the way the chicken is
raised affects the quality of its eggs.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't tell the different between duck
eggs and chicken eggs. Can you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that dish?
It looks good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Could I... eat that?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
That looks really good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an unusual hoe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know much about tools, but I sense
a strange aura about this one. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, that's a worn hoe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They say that a little bit of your soul
goes into the tools you use...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The more you use a tool, the easier it is
to use. Same with musical instruments...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you plan to do with that hoe, man?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...That's kind of a weird sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}Don't swing that thing around
too much, man. It's dangerous.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an odd sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks like it's still pretty sharp,
considering its age.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's something strange about that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty big watering can.
I guess it holds a lot of water?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You planning on watering something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Was there something about that
watering can you wanted me to see?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an trippy machine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's it for?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do I look like I need something like that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you use those to shear your sheep?
I've seen people do that before.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You use those to shear your sheep?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That might make a nice
pendant.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can sometimes find stones like
that around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What... is... that?
Where'd you dig that up?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks like some kind of fossil...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that some kind of spice?
Mmm. Smells pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet you could cook some mean dishes
with that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}{50_20_0_3}Pretty groovy sound, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}{50_20_0_3}I'm glad you like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?
It's not for me, that's for sure.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that some kind of medal?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a weird necklace.
That looks like it's got a long history.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Not a bad design.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think that's guitar music.
Sheet music usually has five lines
on the staff, but that has six...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You couldn't play that on a piano.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks like a hard piece to play.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A firecracker?
That's pretty big, man.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks kind of like a bomb, you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll pass.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All I need is music and nature's beauty.
I happened upon this place in
my travels.{NextPage_49}
And I guess you could say I fell in love.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
One of my ancestors was a bard serving
in the court of a king somewhere. I guess
that's why I'm a traveling musician.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've met a lot of people in my time,
but that Nami sure is a gas.
A real free spirit. Yeah...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I was traveling long ago, I
met somebody researching insects.
He was a pretty interesting guy...{NextPage_49}
He traveled all over the world
following different kinds of bugs...
I think his name was Chu...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral Town
only cares about money.
There's more to life than money, man.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} has grown every
crop there is, they say.
Pretty amazing, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} Farm's animals
must be pretty happy.
They're well cared for...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral Town
is a master angler.
I'm not interested in fishing, myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that {29_0} from
Mineral Town has walked one million steps.
You know, I bet I've walked more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} Farm in Mineral Town
has been going for 50 years.
You'd better work hard too, man...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral Town
has really bad taste.
I wonder what she did...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer in Mineral Town
keeps buying new cottages.
That's greed, man. Plain and simple.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that there is a blacksmith in
Mineral Town who makes amazing tools.
I'd like to meet him someday.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}The {29_0} you gave me
was really far out man.
It's one of my favorites.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese was kind of smelly.
But I think I could get to like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that cheese you gave me,
right, man?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter was kind of smelly.
But I think I could get to like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that butter you gave me,
right, man?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me
was totally amazing!
I love that stuff.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}That dish you gave me
wasn't half bad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}The fish you gave me
was good, man.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}That thing you gave me...
It wasn't bad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Growing crops looks like a lot of work,
but you're doing your best.
You're in tune with nature and the earth.
{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like things that make sounds, so I
collect instruments from around the world.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I try to have my music blend in with
the melodies of mother nature...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't you feel relaxed just being here?
No?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good drinks and good music...
It doesn't get any better than this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
 
----------x----------
 
----------x----------
 
----------x----------
Griffin and I keep saying that we should
have a jam session together sometime,
but...{NextPage_49}
We never seem to actually do it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}Enjoying yourself?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}The music that Griffin and I play
may sound different, but down deep
it's the same.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Smells good, eh?
I'm burning some incense.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you think?
Kind of an interesting room, eh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Living in a yurt like this can
really come in handy if you
like to travel.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I often kick back here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you stop here very
often?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I'll go play my guitar somewhere...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I'm walking around here,
ideas for all kinds of melodies
just come to me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Apparently there is a country where they
call spring the Season of Parrots.
Because the trees turn green like birds.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Forget-Me-Not Valley is usually pretty
comfortable.
It's a little hot now, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
At this time of year you can see a pretty
red star over the ocean to the south.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Apparently there is a country where they
call summer the Season of Pepper.
Because it's hot outside and all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I always feel like writing poetry at
this time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I come up with a good poem, I always
feel like singing it. And the melody just
comes naturally...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Apparently there is a country where
they call fall the Umber Season.
Sounds pretty earthy, eh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
At night you can see a pretty yellow
star appear above the mountains to the
east. It's a little hard to see, though...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When the air is so cold and clear, it
seems like my guitar sounds a
lot prettier.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Apparently there is a country where they
call winter the Indigo Season.
It's a relaxing image, don't you think?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The stars are the prettiest at this time
of year. In particular, there's a blue
star that appears over the waterfall...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you think? Nice song, eh?
{41_3_1}Yes, it's nice.
Not really.
Nice guitar work.
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}You think so? I'm glad.
It's one of my favorite songs.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see. Well, everyone strums to a
different chord in music.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}Ha, ha, ha. I'm not trying hard.
But it's nice of you to say so.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Would you like to sing with me?
The words don't really matter.
Just sing something along with the melody.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}This feels good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
♪Lalalalaaalalalalalaaaa♪
♪Ladedumdeladedum♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lumina sure plays piano well.
She's got a really unique
style.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lumina sure plays piano well.
She's gotten a lot better.
I really enjoy listening to her play.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If Lumina practices, I'm sure she
could be really good.
She might be quite a pianist.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel kind of bad listening
to live music like this for
free.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't play the piano,
but I love to listen to it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can usually hear the piano when I come
here, so I often stop by for a visit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cody's artwork is pretty interesting, eh?
You really get a feeling of strength from
the work, but also some gentleness.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You shouldn't look at art and try to
understand it. You should just look at it
and let yourself experience it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Expressing yourself in art can be
very difficult.
That's why Cody's so amazing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I look at Cody's art, I get ideas
for songs. The melody just sort of
bubbles up from inside me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nina was a really good person...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish she lived to hear one of
the songs I wrote...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I sometimes come here to pay my
respects to Nina.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you have good timing!
I'm not at home very much, so it
can be hard to catch me here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess you like music too?
Well, I guess everyone who comes
here likes music.{NextPage_49}
{50_20_0_3}Oh yeah. I've got something for you.
It's a drum that I found on my travels.
It's kind of unusual...{NextPage_49}
When you hold it and talk to people,
it'll make noise on its own.
Here, try it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks, man.
But I have to pass right now.
Sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's raining...
I love getting wet in the rain.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If it's raining, just let yourself get
soaked. If you don't like getting wet,
just wait for it to stop before going out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't mind getting soaked?
It feels good, doesn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm gonna crash pretty soon, man...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've gotta crash now.
Can you be moving on, man?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Night...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've gotta be leaving pretty soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've gotta go out now.
So...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Catch you later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The weather sure is nice today...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's wrong?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You feeling bad or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your face looks a little red.
You don't have a fever, do you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nami.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_26_0_3}Take care of yourself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Rain is nature's blessing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Water is very important to human beings.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If it weren't for the blessing of the
rain, you and I and... well, everyone
wouldn't be able to live.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you think of it that way, rain
isn't so bad, is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ahh.
I feel just great today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey!
You got a second?
{41_2_0}Sure.
Nope.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm feeling so good today...{NextPage_49}
I've been playing my guitar especially
well lately, and this weather is the
greatest. All is groovy, man!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't you ever have a day when everything
seems to go right?
{41_2_0}Never.
Sure.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I guess it depends on the person.
If you say you don't, then you don't.
Simple.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Right on!
You understand me?{NextPage_49}
Cool.
It's nice to find somebody who's
on my wavelength, you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yep.{NextPage_1}Since we seem to be getting along
so well, I think I'll give you
a song as a present.{NextPage_1}Will you listen to it?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Listen.
Don't listen.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There was... a miraculous... apple♪{NextPage_1}That grew... on a tree...♪{NextPage_1}If you ate it...{NextPage_1}You'd get... wishes three...♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's too bad.
You're busy today?
I guess I'll let you go then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's all I have to say now.
Let's talk again sometime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm...
What should I do today?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, did you come to see me?
{41_2_0}That's right.
No, I didn't.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome.
Taking a break from the farm?
I was just wondering what to do today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I spend most of my time outside, so it's
kind of hard to think of things to do
when I'm at home. I always sing outside.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So what should we do?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know.
Why don't we have a nice long talk?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Yes, let's!
No thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It can be nice to stay at home
at relax.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I always feel more relaxed when I'm
surrounded by my instruments.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't this an interesting place?{NextPage_1}I mean, there are all kinds of people
here, all living their own lives.{NextPage_1}And I think the name “Forget-Me-Not
Valley“ has a nice ring to it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I see.
That's too bad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come back if you change your mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you think?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}I'm not sure.
I like it here too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?{NextPage_1}I hope you'll get to like it
here.{NextPage_1}Thanks for stopping by.
We'll have to do this again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well now. I think we're going
to get along just fine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?
I hope I didn't say something wrong.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come back anytime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, I was passing nearby, so I thought
I'd come and see your farm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's pretty big, huh?
Sorry for just coming in like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought I might go for a walk now.
You want to come along?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Sure.
I can't.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The waterfall is pretty on days like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's nothing like a nice stroll.{NextPage_1}I could do it all day.{NextPage_49}
When I set out for my stroll today, for
some reason I thought of your face.{NextPage_1}I thought maybe you'd like to join me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looking at a waterfall always relaxes me.{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Me too.
I don't think so.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I almost forgot.
This is for you.
Just a little “thank you” for coming.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, bye.
I should be getting home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?
I thought for sure you would
like it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I should be getting home.
See you later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see.
Well, I guess it can't be helped.
See you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey there.
How about having a drink with me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like it here.
I come here all the time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A toast: To today. Without it, we'd
never have a yesterday or a tomorrow.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh yeah.
The weather's nice tonight.
How about going to look at the night sky?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Sure.
No thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't it nice to look up at the sky?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've always felt like the stars are
trying to tell us something.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If that's true, what do you
think they're trying to tell us?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}I'm not really interested.
I'll think about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?
You should think about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I should be going home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See you later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You shouldn't give too much thought
to this kind of thing, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just save up whatever you're thinking
for another day like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I'm going to take a little stroll
and look at the night sky.
See you later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh really?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's drink together again.{NextPage_1}See you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's all for today.
Maybe I'll let you hear the rest
sometime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know!{NextPage_1}I'll give you a song as a present,
in honor of our relationship.{NextPage_1}Will you give it a listen?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Listen.
Don't listen.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It was three days later...{NextPage_1}that a dwarf happened by...{NextPage_1}He thought of the girl he loved...{NextPage_1}She was the “apple of his eye.”{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel like singing a song.
Will you give it a listen?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Listen.
Don't listen.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dadadadum!{NextPage_1}The dwarf...{NextPage_1}Turned into the girl
that he loved so...{NextPage_1}He looked like her...{NextPage_1}Dressed like her...{NextPage_1}And even smelled like her! Woah!♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that one of those Blue Feathers?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've heard about them, but I've
never seen one.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think I know what it means
for you to offer this to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you.
I feel kind of strange...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I do have one thing that I
want to say to you, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About my house...
I'd like to keep it as it is even after
we get married.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love this location.
You can come and visit whenever
I'm here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel like singing...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lalalala...
We'll be happy if our
love is true....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lulululu....
I think I can do it if I'm with you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lalalalala... I guess there's nothing
left but to say “I do.”{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You showed me that before.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
At the time, I didn't want to take it.
I'm sorry for giving you the runaround.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd be happy to take that now.
We'll have a great life together.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, ducks are in our pond.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now where could they have come from?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Should we keep them?
{41_2_0}Keep them.
Don't keep them.
----------x----------
Far out.
I guess we should give them names, then...
What should we name the male?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh... That's too bad.
I guess we'd better let them go, then...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Input_128}?{32_3_232}
OK, what about the female?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Input_128} it is, then.{32_3_232}
...We'd better show them the {Location_43_21_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, it's time for
bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}Hmm?
Where did that kid go?
It's time for bed...
{CharName_1}!{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_0}{2d}, I'm going to go
looking for {CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hm? {CharName_1}
still hasn't come home.
{50_20_0_9}Hmmm{32_1_44}.{32_1_44}.{32_1_44}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_0}{2d}, {CharName_1}'s late...
I'll go take a stroll and look around.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}{CharName_1}, having fun is important,
but you've got to be more responsible.{32_3_232}
{50_20_0_3}You've got to come home on time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess it's {CharName_1}'s
bedtime already.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come on and get into bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's late. It's time for bed.
Good night, {CharName_1}....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's about {CharName_1}'s bedtime.
Do you think that kid's in bed?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yaaaawn....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning, {2d}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good morning, {2d}!♪
You're up early.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, it's morning!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, I think I'm going to
turn in now.{NextPage_49}
You worked hard today.
Well, good night...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
♪It's time for {CharName_1}
to go to bed....
Go and rest your sleepy head....♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're still not asleep?{32_3_32}
You're missing all those great dreams!{NextPage_49}
Now close your eyes...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's right. Good.
Say “good night” to Mommy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Whenever I get emotionally moved
I feel like singing a song.{NextPage_1}Would you like to hear one?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Listen.
Don't listen.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He became.....the girl he loved....{NextPage_1}But then the girl.... his beloved dove....{NextPage_1}Came to visit, wouldn't you bet?{NextPage_1}And the two of 'em, their eyes met....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, one more thing.
I've got a present for you.{NextPage_1}I've been writing a song for you
all this time.{NextPage_1}I think you've heard part of it, but
I finally finished it today, so I'd
like you to hear it.{NextPage_1}Will you listen to it for me?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Listen.
Don't listen.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That miraculous fruit fell out...{NextPage_1}as he stood with his mouth agape...{NextPage_1}And he turned back to his normal shape...{NextPage_1}Did the dwarf and girl ever fall in love?{NextPage_1}Did he win the hand of his little dove?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you'll think about the lyrics, you'll
find out how I feel about you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I see.
Well, that's OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}{34_0_64}{2d},
I'm looking for something...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hm?
What's going on?{50_20_0_1}{NextPage_49}
Some kind of secret meeting here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You seem kind of serious...
Is it something I shouldn't hear?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}It's a secret!
Love problems.
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}I see. Well, I guess it's
nice to have some secrets.{NextPage_49}
Go ahead and talk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was just going to ask you about
something I was looking for...
There it is!{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
My lucky adventure travel vest!{NextPage_49}
I wonder if it still fits me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ah, I see.
I thought that was why{CharName_1}
looked so sad.{NextPage_49}
You've got to love all you can while
you're young. It helps you grow.{NextPage_49}
I wonder how our {CharName_1}
will change in the future...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey...{50_20_0_3} What's with the yelling?
Is there a fight going on in there?{34_0_64}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...{32_1_244}{NextPage_49}
So {CharName_1}'s at that
age already, eh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you really love someone,{50_20_0_0}{NextPage_49}
you'll just naturally know what
to do about it.{NextPage_49}
Think what you could do to make
her happy...{32_1_244}{NextPage_1}{32_1_244}What can you do...?{32_1_244}{NextPage_49}
Just think about it.{NextPage_49}
It's all right.{32_1_244} You'll do fine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you heard who the lucky
one is, I guess?{32_5_220}{NextPage_49}
Sigh... {32_5_220} I thought {CharName_1}
would come and talk to me first,
but...{NextPage_49}
I guess I was wrong about that,
huh?{NextPage_49}
Heh. Oh well...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I'll put my feelings into a song...
Lalalalaaaa♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wondered where you were.
So you were here drinking, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take it easy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}...
I'm going to go back first.
I just thought of a song...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wait a minute...
What was that song again? Darn.
I've got to go home and write it down.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have no idea what{50_20_0_9}
you're talking about.{32_1_244}
Can you explain it to me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {50_20_0_1}welcome home. Were you listening?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}That can't be.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_9}I always tried to respect
you as a person.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that nice, {CharName_1}?
All nice and clean.
I'm certainly envious...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_20_0_3}I bet that feels better, {CharName_1}!♪
Isn't that nice!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, can't you
give {CharName_1} a bath?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning.
It's me, {CharName_20}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry to just show up like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's been almost exactly a year
since you came here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A lot has happened since then.
To tell you the truth, the time I spent
with you was the best time I've ever had.{NextPage_1}So...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Will you marry me?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Yes. Let's work the farm together.
I'm sorry.
----------x----------
Thank you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This'll be so much fun!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{32_1_244}I understand...
{32_15_160}Goodbye...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You plan to be alone for the
rest of your life? {32_15_160}I...
I just think that's a shame...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
Sorry to just show up like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's been almost exactly a year
since you came here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know this is sudden.{NextPage_1}But a lot has happened.
And I find that I can't imagine life
without you...{NextPage_1}You were always the one I wanted to
hear my songs. So...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Will you marry me?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Yes. Let's work the farm together.
I'm sorry.
----------x----------
Thank you!!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We'll sing a song of happiness together!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I understand...
You're going to remain single...
But I think that's a terrible shame...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Goodbye...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------


----------x----------
What a pretty feather.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I have that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good morning!{NextPage_1}It's a beautiful day today!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So, shall we go tell everybody?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{NextPage_0}
