Today we'll talk
about food for the{NextPage_1}cattle. Do you guys
have a question,
Cole or Tom? {NextPage_1}Cole: "What do the
cattle eat?"{NextPage_1}...They mainly eat
{13}{25_0_3}{17}
twice a day!{NextPage_1}Tom: "I see. They eat
twice a day. Do they
eat snacks? I can't{NextPage_1}live without snacks
myself!" {NextPage_1}...Like every other
kid, the cattle like
to have snacks too.{NextPage_1}Tom: "Really? They
eat snacks like us?"{NextPage_1}...But you can't give
too many snacks just
because they like it.{NextPage_1}They have to eat
{13}{25_0_3}{17}
everyday.{NextPage_1}Tom: "Okay!"
...See you next time.

Today we'll talk
about stress.{NextPage_1}Do you guys have a
question, Cole or
Tom? {NextPage_1}Tom: "Huh...mmm..."
...What's wrong, Tom?{NextPage_1}Tom: "I feel
irritated. I guess
I'm stressed out."{NextPage_1}...Well, you have to
learn to release your
stress. {NextPage_1}Cole: "Do the cattle
get stressed out?"
...Yes, they do.{NextPage_1}Let me tell you about
their stress. {NextPage_1}When they get
stressed out, they
easily get annoyed,{NextPage_1}and they produce
less milk both in
terms of the quality{NextPage_1}and the quantity.
Sometimes they get
sick as well. {NextPage_1}Cole: "I see. But
how do they get
stressed?" {NextPage_1}...For example, if
you keep them in the
barn for a long time,{NextPage_1}or if you keep them
outside in the rain,
and if you ever annoy{NextPage_1}them intentionally,
they'll get unhappy.
Tom: "Just like us."{NextPage_1}Cole: "How do you
make them feel
better?"{NextPage_1}...You can let them
outside when the
weather is nice. {NextPage_1}Don't forget to brush
them and wash them
too. {NextPage_1}Cole: "I like to
play outside too."
Tom: "I can release{NextPage_1}my stress by eating."
...Oh, Tom.
See you next time!

Today we'll talk
about milk.{NextPage_1}Do you guys have a
question, Cole or
Tom?{NextPage_1}Tom: "How many times
can we milk a cow?"
...If you milk a cow{NextPage_1}in the morning, you
can do it one more
time in the evening.{NextPage_1}Cole: "Twice a day?
Wow, cows are hard
working!"{NextPage_1}...Hey, Cole, did you
know that you can
only milk cows that{NextPage_1}have had babies?
Cole: "Yes, I know!"
Tom: "Really!? I{NextPage_1}thought they all have
milk when they grow
up!"{NextPage_1}...Many people don't
know about it. Humans
are the same, right?{NextPage_1}Tom: "I see. Cows
are like humans."
...Milking is good{NextPage_1}for them. If you
don't milk them for
a while, they get{NextPage_1}sick, so be careful.
Tom: "I could never
leave delicious milk{NextPage_1}alone!"
...Oh, Tom. You have
to be nice to the{NextPage_1}cows when you milk
them. You can't just
milk them whenever{NextPage_1}you want.
Tom: "Okay!"
...See you next time!
----------x----------
Dairy Farm News!
Today we'll talk
about the quantity{NextPage_1}of milk. Do you guys
have a question,
Cole or Tom?{NextPage_1}Cole: "Do the cows
have the same amount
of milk everyday?"{NextPage_1}...The quantity of
milk they produce
depends on their{NextPage_1}health, the seasons
and the days past
delivery.{NextPage_1}Cole: "Really? The
seasons too?"
...They produce more{NextPage_1}milk in the cold
seasons than the
warm ones.{NextPage_1}Tom: "What do you
mean by the days past
delivery?"{NextPage_1}...They produce less
milk as the time goes
by from the day they{NextPage_1}had a baby. In about
40 days, they stop
producing milk.{NextPage_1}Tom: "I see, so if
you want to get milk,
they have to have{NextPage_1}babies regularly."
...That's right.
See you next time!

Today we'll talk
about the quality{NextPage_1}of milk. Do you guys
have a question,
Cole or Tom?{NextPage_1}Tom: "I think milk
tastes different
depending on the{NextPage_1}season. Is it just
me, or...?"
...Good point, Tom!{NextPage_1}Cole: "Really? It
tastes different?"
...Yes, Cole. {NextPage_1}It tastes better in
the cold seasons.
Tom: "I knew it!{NextPage_1}But I have a
question..."
...What, Tom?{NextPage_1}Tom: "Do calves drink
the same milk as we
do? They need a lot{NextPage_1}of nutrients, right?"
...Tom, another good
point! Cows that just{NextPage_1}have had babies
produce special milk.
Tom: "I knew it!"{NextPage_1}...The milk produced
within 3 days of
delivery is full of{NextPage_1}special nutrients.
Calves grow stronger
with this milk.{NextPage_1}Cole: "Really. The
milk is very
important!"{NextPage_1}...We drink normal
milk, but the special
milk is not sold{NextPage_1}anywhere because it's
for calves.
Tom: "I see. So the{NextPage_1}milk we drink and the
milk calves drink are
different... I wonder{NextPage_1}what it tastes like?"
...You may be able to
taste it if you go to{NextPage_1}a farm.
Tom: "Sounds good...
I'll try it."{NextPage_1}...Oh, Tom. You do
anything for food?
See you next time!

Dairy Farm News!
Today we'll talk
about a calf's birth.{NextPage_1}Do you guys have a
question, Cole or
Tom?{NextPage_1}Cole: "How long do
calves stay in their
moms' tummy?"{NextPage_1}...About 30 days.
Cole: "That long?"
Tom: "Is there any{NextPage_1}way to know when the
baby is coming? I'd
be surprised if they{NextPage_1}came all of a
sudden."
...Ha ha, you're{NextPage_1}right. As it gets
closer to the due
date, a cow's udder{NextPage_1}becomes reddish.
Tom: "When does that
start?"{NextPage_1}...Um, about 6 days
prior to the due
date. In the mean{NextPage_1}time, mommy cows have
to eat well. It's
called the{NextPage_1}'dry period'.
Can you guys say it?
Both: "Dry period."{NextPage_1}...That's right.
We can't milk them
during that period.{NextPage_1}Both: "Okay!"
...And when a mother
cow's udder becomes{NextPage_1}reddish , make a
space for her in the
barn, okay?{NextPage_1}Cole: "We can make a
fence to protect
her!" {NextPage_1}...Yes, and don't
forget to take care
of her everyday.{NextPage_1}Both: "Okay!"
See you next time!

Dairy Farm News!
Today we'll talk
about calves.{NextPage_1}Do you guys have a
question, Cole or
Tom?{NextPage_1}Cole: "How do you
take care of a
newborn calf?"{NextPage_1}...Newborn calves are
very delicate, so be
careful with germs.{NextPage_1}Tom: "I guess they
were protected by
their moms before{NextPage_1}they were born."
...To protect a baby
calf, isolate it from{NextPage_1}other animals.
Cole: "They can't
stay with their{NextPage_1}moms?"
...They could, but
it's better to be{NextPage_1}safe than sorry.
Cole: "I guess so."
Tom: "What do they{NextPage_1}eat?"
...They only drink
milk for 6 days after{NextPage_1}birth.
Cole: "So we have to
get milk for them{NextPage_1}from their moms."
...It's a lot of work
to take care of{NextPage_1}newborn calves.
Tom: "But! They'll
drink milk from the{NextPage_1}bottles we give
them, right? Once we
see the way they{NextPage_1}drink milk, we'll
forget all the
troubles because{NextPage_1}they are so cute!"
...You're right.
After about 6 days,{NextPage_1}they can start eating
{13}{25_0_3}{17} too.
Then they can soon{NextPage_1}join others in the
barn.
Both: "Okay!"{NextPage_1}...See you next time!

how that cow is

difference!"
...You see?{NextPage_1}{34_0_210}{32_4_176}Tom: "Wow! That
sounded sad!"{NextPage_1}...That's right.
Something might have
happened.{NextPage_1}Cole: "Cool! I feel
like I can become
friends with them!"{NextPage_1}...Don't forget
what you learned

question, Tom or
Cole?{NextPage_1}Tom: "I saw some cows
with stars on their

are they?"
...They must be the{NextPage_1}Star Cows. Their milk
is very good quality.
The milk is good for{NextPage_1}cheese and butter
as well.
Cole: "The Star Cows{NextPage_1}have stars on their
forehead. That's easy
to remember."{NextPage_1}Tom: "And I saw a cow
that looked like a
regular cow but with{NextPage_1}some yellow and
black spots."
...You remember well,{NextPage_1}Tom! The ones with
yellow spots are the
Marble Cows. Their{NextPage_1}milk is good to
make cheese with.
Tom: "So the ones{NextPage_1}with only black spots
are Normal Cows."
...Yes. The quality{NextPage_1}of their milk is not
as good as others,
but they produce{NextPage_1}more milk.
Cole: "Are there any
other kinds?"{NextPage_1}...The Brown Cows are
light brown color,
and their milk is{NextPage_1}good to make butter
with.
Cole: "I see. I wanna{NextPage_1}see them."
Tom: "I wanna drink
all kinds of milk..."{NextPage_1}...Oh, Tom.

does it look like?"
...You see a section{NextPage_1}in the farm with good
soil. You have to
till the soil and{NextPage_1}plant the seeds.
Jack: "Can you grow
any kind of crops?"{NextPage_1}...Not really. Some
crops need better
soil than others,{NextPage_1}do you understand?
Jack: "Kind of..."
...See you next time.

Today we'll talk
about watering.{NextPage_1}Do you guys have a
question, Syd or
Jack?{NextPage_1}Jack: "So if you sow
the seeds, do they
start growing?"{NextPage_1}...They don't grow
unless you water
them.{NextPage_1}Syd: "How do you
water them?"
...Use your{NextPage_1}Watering Can.
Jack: "How often
do we need to water{NextPage_1}them?"
...Well, you have to
figure it out by{NextPage_1}looking at the soil.
Water the field when
the soil is dry.{NextPage_1}Jack: "What happens
if I forget?"
...If you don't water{NextPage_1}well, the seeds won't
sprout, and even if
they did, they could{NextPage_1}wither. So, you
have to water the
field everyday.{NextPage_1}Twice a day will do.
Do you understand?
Syd: "Okay." {NextPage_1}...See you next time.

...Yes, of course.{NextPage_1}Jack: "After the

crops, right?"{NextPage_1}...That's right.
The flowers and then
the crops.{NextPage_1}Syd: "So we can't
pick the flowers
then."{NextPage_1}...Ha ha ha,
that's correct.
Crops need the{NextPage_1}flowers to grow.
Jack: "Once they
grow, we can harvest{NextPage_1}them, right?"
...Not so fast,
but let's call it{NextPage_1}a day.
See you next time.

about harvesting.{NextPage_1}Do you guys have a
question, Syd or

crops that don't grow
vegetables?"{NextPage_1}...No really, but
the root crops grow
underground.{NextPage_1}Jack: "How do you
know when to harvest
the root crops?"{NextPage_1}...The flowers of the
root crops will wilt
after a while. Then{NextPage_1}just pull them out.
Syd: "Can you eat
roots?"{NextPage_1}...We are always
eating them. Turnips,
Potatoes, Carrots and{NextPage_1}stuff like that.

Syd: "Then that's
a lot of work."{NextPage_1}...No, you don't have
to water them after
you plant them.{NextPage_1}Jack: "Really?
Then that's easy."
...But they need{NextPage_1}a lot of nutrients,
so other crops won't
grow around them.{NextPage_1}Jack: "...You mean?"
...Other crops die
even if they sprout.{NextPage_1}Syd: "So we can't
plant anything
around the trees."{NextPage_1}...Right. So, think
carefully when
planting them.{NextPage_1}Jack: "I see..."
...See you next time.

grow in about 5 days.{NextPage_1}Each type of crop
grows differently
too, trees take{NextPage_1}longer to grow.

Today we'll talk
about harvesting.{NextPage_1}Do you guys have a

Once a tree grows,
the flowers bloom in{NextPage_1}a certain season, and
then the fruit grows
in the following{NextPage_1}season.
Sean: "So you climb
up a tree to get{NextPage_1}them, right?"
...You can't pick
them. You must{NextPage_1}shake the tree to
make the fruit fall.
Mike: "...I see."{NextPage_1}...Even if you don't
shake the tree, the
fruit will drop when{NextPage_1}it is mature.
Sean: "But I think
it's fun to shake{NextPage_1}the trees."
...Either way, if you
leave the fruit on{NextPage_1}the ground, it'll
