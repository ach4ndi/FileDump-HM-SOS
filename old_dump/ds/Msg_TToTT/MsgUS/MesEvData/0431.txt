\u1f41\u1faa\u1f4c\u2136What am I going to do?\u2328My violin just doesn't\u2328sound right.\u232bThe birds won't sing along\u2328to my playing like they\u2328usually do.
\u1f40\u1fc1\u1f49\u2135Sounds pretty good to me.\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f49\u2136No, no, it's all wrong.\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f4b\u2136Normally I play much better\u2328than this, but recently my\u2328sound has been off.\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f4c\u2136I need to have my violin\u2328properly serviced...\u232b\u1f40\u1fc1\u1f48\u2135You do, do ya?\u2328Based on my experience, it's\u2328something with your strings.\u232bI might be able to fix it.\u2328Here, let me see.
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136This violin is very special\u2328to me, so please handle it\u2328carefully.\u232b\u1f40\u1fc1\u1f48\u2135I'm a master blacksmith,\u2328aren't I? Don't worry, I'll\u2328fix it all up for you.\u232b\u1f40\u1fc1\u1f49\u2135In fact, I bet I can get it\u2328to sound even better than\u2328it does now.\u232bJust leave it to me.\u232b\u1f40\u1fc1\u1f48\u2135I'll take it back to my\u2328smithy.
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136You have a lot of tools!\u2328And they're all so well\u2328maintained!\u232b\u1f40\u1fc1\u1f49\u2135Ho ho ho!\u2328They're more important to me\u2328than life itself, my tools.\u232b\u1f40\u1fc1\u1f48\u2135This is quite a violin you\u2328have here, Mikhail.\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f49\u2136Thank you very much.\u232bIt was given to me by my\u2328teacher. It's my most\u2328precious possession.
\u1f40\u1fc1\u1f48\u2135All right, that'll do the\u2328trick.
\u1f41\u1faa\u1f49\u2136You're done already!?\u232b\u1f40\u1fc1\u1f48\u2135It wasn't a very difficult\u2328piece of work.\u2328Now try playing it.
\u1f40\u1fc1\u1f49\u2135Now that's what I call a\u2328fine-sounding instrument!\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f49\u2136All thanks to you, Sheng!\u2328I can't thank you enough.\u232b\u1f40\u1fc1\u1f48\u2135It was nothing.\u232b\u1f40\u1fc1\u1f49\u2135I wanted to hear that violin\u2328the way it's supposed to\u2328sound. Now I'm satisfied.\u232bCome by again any time if\u2328you need anything.\u232b\u1f41\u1faa\u1f48\u2136I'll try to keep it in good\u2328repair, but I'm glad to know\u2328you're here if I need you.
