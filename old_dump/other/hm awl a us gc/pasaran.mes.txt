That poor silly girl.
How could she go before me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, would you
sing a song for her?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry, but I'm
goin' to bed soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's time for me to go to bed.
Could you leave now?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, good night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry, but I'm goin'
out soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to leave now,
so if you don't mind?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See you later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pardon me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Listen here, Sweetie.
Do you have a second?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}Why, you don't have anythin' at all.
Did you sell out all ready?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh well. No point in gettin' upset.
I'll try again some other time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm just lookin', Sweetie.
Don't mind me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is this all you have?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like that {29_0},
but how much is it, Sweetie?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
Good gravy!
That sure is a screamin' deal!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well then I'll take it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want the {29_0}, but
how much is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
Never mind.
Sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My name's Patrick. I'm the second best
fireworks designer in the world.{NextPage_49}
By the way, the best is my twin
brother Kassey.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_7}Hmmm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_7}............
Sorry, but could you
leave me alone?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_4}{34_1_112}What do you want, huh?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_4}What do you want?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mornin'.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Evenin'.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Evenin'.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello, sonny.
What're you doin' out this time of night?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Evenin'.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Evenin' Sweetie. Pretty late, ain't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, it's you, Sweetie.
Did you need somethin'?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that for me?
{50_23_0_3}Ooh! That's one of my favorites!
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_3}Well, thank you very much!
You're all right, Sweetie.
I'm lookin' forward to eatin' this...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_9}{34_1_112}Oh, I see.
Well, never mind then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks good.
It makes me drool just to look at it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got somethin' nice there, Sweetie.
{50_23_0_9}Is that for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
That's one of my weaknesses.
I like it almost as much as fireworks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry, but...
I'd prefer not to look at that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_9}I'm sorry, but just lookin' at that
makes me feel sick.
Ugh!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}What is that?
Sorry, I'm not interested.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry, Sweetie.
Could you make it somethin' else?
Like an encyclopedia of fireworks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_3}Well, well, well. Isn't this nice?
I've never seen a cuter child. Yes, yours
is definitely the best!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_3}I think I see a resemblance.
Yep, that's a cute kid all right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey there, Sweetie.
Animals sure are cute, aren't they?
Maybe I should get a pet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what kind of pet I
should get?
Maybe a raccoon?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}What kind of seed is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck growin' your
crops.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}I bet you grew that yourself.
It looks quite good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks very good.
I hope you try other crops, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}Is that from your farm?
It looks very fresh and
tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yep.
It looks good for you, and
tasty too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}Did you catch that fish?
You're multi-talented, ain't you Sweetie?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Fishin' looks like it'd be fun.
Me, I prefer playin' my game.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}Did you pick that yourself?
Those are good in cookin', I hear.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Collectin' wild plants looks fun.
Me, I prefer playin' my game.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}Why, that dish looks good enough to eat!
{50_23_0_3}Is it for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_3}Yep, it sure looks good.
I love that stuff.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}Is that a good hoe?
I'm sorry, I'm really only interested in
fireworks and playin' my game.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_111}Don't you use hoes for
tillin' fields, Sweetie?
What're you doin' with it here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yep, the more you use a tool,
the easier it is to use.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}Is that a good sickle?
I'm sorry, I'm really only interested in
fireworks and playin' my game.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_111}Don't you use sickles for
cuttin' grass, sonny?
What're you doin' with it here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}Why, that's a waterin' can.
Don't you use that to water plants
or bonsai trees?
{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It doesn't have much to do
with makin' fireworks, does it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}What in the heavens is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, a device for milkin' cows?
That sounds right convenient.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}Clippers, eh?
Not very useful in makin' fireworks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those can be dangerous.
Be careful when you use them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you use your tools well they
can make your work easier, Sweetie.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}Ooh! Lemme see!
Is that for me?
{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_3}I don't know what it is,
but I like it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}Don't those plants grow
all around here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't know much about
plants, Sweetie.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}What've you got there, sonny?
Some kind of doggy disk?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know!
It's a dart board, right? But it's kind of
plain and doesn't have the scores on it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}What's that you have there, Sweetie?
Does it have somethin' to do with me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}Is that
rare or somethin''?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}Interestin' sound.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}What is that, anyway?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}That's one of my firecrackers.
When're you gonna set that baby off?
It's a good one.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you set that little baby off, it'll
light up with rainbow colored flowers,
stars and hearts. It'll be great.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that for me?
{34_1_112}Oh, it isn't?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Who're you givin' that to?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We live in an elevated house, my twin
brother and me. We make fireworks.
The name's Patrick.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you're talkin' about fireworks, my
Kassey is a bit better than me.{NextPage_49}
But I'm a bit better than him at
our game.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't go out much, but I do
sometimes sneak out to the
bar for a drink.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_3}That thing you gave me
was mighty good, Sweetie.
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_9}To tell you the truth, that thing you
gave me is one of my least favorite foods.
Sorry, Sweetie.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me
was... pretty mediocre.
Sorry, Sweetie.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me
was mighty good, Sweetie.
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_3}The {29_0} you gave me was
just delicious. That's some good eatin'!
Thank you. Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_3}The {29_0} you gave me
tasted just like I like.
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
tasted a little off to me.
But thanks anyway.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
wasn't bad.
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_3}That milk you gave me a while ago
was just delicious.
Thank you. Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_3}That milk you gave me a while ago
was just delicious.
Thank you. Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
was a little too smelly for my
taste, Sweetie.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me a while ago
was mighty good, but maybe a little
smelly.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave me a while ago
was mighty good, Sweetie.
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that cheese you gave me
a while back, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter you gave me a while ago
was mighty good.
Thank you. Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that butter you gave me
a while back, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That dish you gave me a while ago
was mighty good, Sweetie.
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That fish you gave me a while ago
was mighty good, Sweetie.
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That wild plant you gave me a while ago
was mighty good, Sweetie.
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That food you gave me a while ago
was mighty good, Sweetie.
Thanks a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've been workin' hard every day.
Whether it's fireworks or farmin', gettin'
skilled at somethin' is never easy.{NextPage_49}
But you're a real farmer now.
Well done.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear you're skilled at growin' things.
Whether it's fireworks or farmin', gettin'
skilled at somethin' is never easy.{NextPage_49}
Keep up the good work and make
lots of tasty vegetables.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear you're quite a good cook.
Whether it's fireworks or cookin', gettin'
skilled at somethin' is never easy.{NextPage_49}
Keep up the good work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Workin' hard every day, are you?
Hard work is the key to success.{NextPage_49}
It may be difficult, but just think how
well your farm is doin' now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Workin' hard at growin' crops, eh?
Hard work is the key to success.{NextPage_49}
Farmin' is a noble profession.
Keep up the good work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hear you often cook at home.
People say you're quite skilled.{NextPage_49}
Hard work is the key to success.
I'm sure it'll pay off.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}Are you used to farm work?
Well, now the real work begins.
But you're young. You can do it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}Are you used to growin' crops?
You're still young. You should do
what you think you're suited for.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}Are you used to cookin'?
You're still young. You should do
what you think you're suited for.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you like fireworks?
{41_3_1}Sure.
Not really.
Never seen them.
----------x----------
{50_23_0_3}Well, well, that's good.
I'd love to show you mine sometime.
{50_23_0_9}But not right now.{NextPage_49}
I'm in the middle of researchin' a new
firecracker. I've decided not to set any
others off until I finish.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}Really, you don't like fireworks?
That's pretty unusual around here.
Well, it's OK I guess.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}{50_23_0_12}Really? Never seen fireworks?
You poor girl. They're so beautiful, too.
I'd love to show you mine sometime.{NextPage_49}
{50_23_0_9}But I'm in the middle of researchin' a new
firecracker. I've decided not to set any
others off until I finish.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_111}Don't talk to me while I'm
makin' fireworks. Even the tiniest mistake
and KABLAMMO!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_111}Don't touch anythin' over there.
One wrong move and KABLAMMO!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you beat one of us at our game,
you'd better be careful.
One wrong move and KABLAMMO!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When Kassey's in a bad mood
you'd better be careful.
One wrong move and KABLAMMO!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When your spouse is in a bad mood
you'd better be careful.
One wrong move and KABLAMMO!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_111}{50_23_0_12}The bar here's a little too
high up for me and my brother. I suppose
{50_23_0_4}it's partly our fault for bein' short.{NextPage_49}
Who do I complain to? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My favorite drink is the {13}Moo-moo Milk{17}.
{50_23_0_3}I bet you can understand why.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Griffin is often quiet and
reserved, but put a guitar in his hands
and he's a howlin' cat!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pretty unusual house, eh?
Try not to wander around too much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't touch anythin' over
there.
It's dangerous.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_3}It's so relaxin' here.
Don't you think so?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_3}So you like it here too, Sweetie?
I see. I see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel great at this time of year.
Makes me want to start somethin' new.
Don't you feel that way, too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yep. This is the perfect time of
year for enjoyin' nature and the
company of good friends.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
One of the best things about my
game is that you can enjoy it year round,
no matter what the weather is like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of firecracker should I make
next. Plannin' is one of the best parts
my job, but it's also the hardest.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a little hot, ain't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Of course, I suppose I should say that
this time of year is the best for settin'
off fireworks, but... It's so hot...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Not too hot, not too cold.
Ain't this the best time of year?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's nice and cool this time of year.
Maybe I'll make myself a nice
artistic firecracker...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a little nippy out, ain't it sonny?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
At this time of year, I'd love to go to
a hot spring and soak, but that's a little
difficult around here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome.
Hm? No, I'm Patrick, Kassey's brother.
You don't come around here very often.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I may not be as good a fireworks maker as
my brother Kassey, but{NextPage_49}
{50_23_0_3}I've got one more hair on
my head than he does! Ha ha ha!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've got a special present for
you today.{NextPage_49}
It's a firecracker that I made a
long time ago. Set this baby off for me.
No, no thanks are necessary.{NextPage_49}
You've helped me quite a bit, after all.
Just be careful with it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pretty impressive firecracker, eh?
It explodes into rainbow-colored shapes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So, did you come here to play my game?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_3}Well, I've been waitin' for this.
Let's go.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_112}You're not gonna play?
But it's so much fun!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry, could you make it another time?
I'm a little preoccupied right now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
On days like this you have to be
careful not to get the fireworks wet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hate the rain. Can't light a fuse.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry, but your time is up.
{50_23_0_3}I win this time.{NextPage_49}
It's good to be careful about your moves,
but if you take too long, this can happen.
Next game, pay more attention to the time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Too bad.
{50_23_0_3}I win this time.
Hmm. Maybe I tried a little too hard?{NextPage_49}
No, just kiddin'.
I hope you'll come and play me
again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_3}Hmm. That was a close one.
I win this time.
I'll be waitin' for a rematch.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?!
I lose this time.{NextPage_49}
{50_23_0_3}Ho ho ho.
You got me good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_7}Darn!
I lose this time.
You're pretty good, Sweetie.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ho ho ho.
This time it's a tie.{NextPage_49}
You're pretty good, Sweetie.
Let's play again sometime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
In honor of your victory, let me
give you this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love to play again sometime,
sonny.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_23_0_0}Next time things will be different.
I'll be wantin' a rematch sooner or
later, so be ready for me.{NextPage_0}
