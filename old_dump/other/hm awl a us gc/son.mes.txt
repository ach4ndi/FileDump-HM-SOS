I like this shape.{NextPage_49}

Hey!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought I might brush the cows...{32_7_208}
I like farm work.
I want to help out when I get bigger.{NextPage_0}

I thought I might plant some seeds...{32_7_208}
I like farm work.
I want to help out when I get bigger.{NextPage_0}

Yeah, sure...{32_3_232}
----------x----------
Then just leave me alone.{32_3_232}

OK, OK...{32_3_232}
It's always the same thing.
I'm sick of hearing it.{32_3_232}

----------x----------
I don't feel like talking right now.
Could you just go away?{NextPage_0}

But we're still talking.
There are still a lot of things
I want to ask...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK. See you later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've got something I want to talk about...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love working on the farm.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
So I'd like to learn lots of stuff,
and I'd like to be able to
help Mom out, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But she's always so
busy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK. I'll do that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But we're still talking.
There are still a lot of things
I want to ask...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK. See you later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yeah, I know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yeah, when I hear {CharName_27}'s guitar,
it makes me feel great!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh!
I was just listening to {CharName_27} play.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, actually I asked him to
play, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Woah, is it that late?
When I'm listening to music I
lose all track of time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I'd better be going home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was listening to {CharName_27} play guitar.
With {CharName_20}.
See you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was listening to {CharName_27} play guitar.
With Dad...
See you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad...
Do round things ever look square?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do round things ever
look square?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well... Do you know that big round
piece of iron sitting in front of
{CharName_21}'s house?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's one of {CharName_21}'s pieces of art.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He works on that thing all the time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But it never changes shape at all,
does it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's always round.
But to {CharName_21}, it's gradually
changing shape.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
He says that it's starting to look square.
So he's almost done with it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think I'm beginning to understand.
When {CharName_21} says that it's
starting to look square...{32_3_232}{NextPage_1}He's not talking about the shape itself,
but rather its essence.{32_3_232}{NextPage_1}He's trying to breathe his own
image into that clump of iron.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Get it?
I thought that was really cool.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, your timing is just
Perfect.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come on.
It's all right, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Any time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No matter how I try... pant, pant...
I can't beat {CharName_13}... pant, pant{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I'll think about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, hi!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Shhhh...
{CharName_19}'s thinking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hitting it, applying heat...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But what are you doing here so late?
Oh, I get it.
Dad was worried, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I should be going then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was listening to {CharName_19} talk
about his research. It's about energy.
Well, bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_12}Why did Mom start the farm?{NextPage_80}

----------x----------
{50_1_0_13}Who was that?{NextPage_80}

----------x----------
{50_1_0_30}Really?!
I've got a grandfather...?{32_3_232}
{50_1_0_12}So what happened to him?{NextPage_80}

----------x----------
{50_1_0_12}What does Mom say about it?{NextPage_80}

----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}Then I guess...{32_3_232}
{50_1_0_32}I'd like to work on the farm in
honor of my grandfather's memory, too.{NextPage_80}

----------x----------
{50_1_0_3}I'll do the rest.
Why don't you go home and rest?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}You worked hard today, Mom.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Are you going to take a bath now?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}I already did.
That's right.
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}Oh. Never mind, then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_26}I thought it might be nice
for me to get it ready for you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}But maybe next time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}I just thought maybe...{32_1_244}
I could start one for you...?{NextPage_1}{41_3_0}Yes please.♪
No thanks.
I can do it...
----------x----------
{50_1_0_26}Opps, too much cold water.
That would be a bad thing...
{50_1_0_3}You might turn into an ice cube, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_26}Come to think of it...{32_3_232} I should
help you out more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}You know, I remember{32_1_244}...{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I remember the bathtub being bigger when
I was little...{32_5_220}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}It seems like I am always busy doing
something and never have time to relax
in the tub...{32_1_244}{NextPage_1}It is kind of sad...{35_0}{32_5_220}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}I added lots of bubbles to help you relax.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}{34_0_56}{32_5_220}That should be enough
bubbles...{NextPage_1}Well, maybe just a few more...{34_0_56}{32_3_232}{34_0_56}
.........{34_0_56}..........{34_0_56}..........{34_0_80}{35_0}{32_3_232}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}{35_2}There you go Mom... Make sure you relax.
You're not getting any younger.{NextPage_49}
OK, You are all set.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}.............{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ok, just trying to help...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}...................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Someone should do something for you.{50_1_0_3}
Come on, hurry up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, Mom...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_3}Come on, let's go.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um....{32_1_244}
Could I talk to you for a second...?
{41_3_0}What is it?
Could you come back later?
I want to talk to you.
----------x----------
I understand.{32_1_244}
Never mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry, but..{32_1_244}
I have something important to say.{NextPage_1}{32_1_244}Please?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}Umm....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Actually I... {32_1_244}It's about Kate... {32_1_244} She...
.........{NextPage_49}
Do you think Kate and Hugh...{32_1_244}
are like boyfriend and girlfriend?
{41_3_0}I think so.
I don't think so.
I think Kate likes you.
----------x----------
Yeah,{32_1_244} I guess so.{32_1_244}
Hmmm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
・・・{38_3}・・・{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is it wrong of me to feel this
way about her?
{41_2_0}I'm sorry to say this, but...
Not at all!
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}I guess I've got to...{32_1_244}
give up, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_30}What? {32_0_200}.{32_0_200}.{32_0_200}.{32_0_200}What?!{32_1_244}
You really mean that?
But she and Hugh...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What would you do, Dad?{NextPage_49}
If you fell in love with somebody who
may already love somebody else?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}I'll have to give this more thought.{32_1_244}
I'll have to think about me...{32_1_244}
And her...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks. {32_5_220}Mom, Dad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_1}...I see...{32_1_244}
If I can be a match for Hugh...{50_26_0_9}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I may not be able to be a real man like
you, Dad, but I'll do my best!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really? {32_1_244}You really think so?!{32_1_244}
I've still got a chance, right?
{41_2_0}Just kidding!♪
Of course!
----------x----------
Aghh!{32_1_244}
Mom!
Why'd you say that?
{41_2_0}No, I didn't mean that.
It's hopeless.
----------x----------
That didn't sound like a joke!!{NextPage_1}But I'll have to admit, even I think
Hugh has his act together.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I may not be able to beat Hugh...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But I'll do my best with what
I've got!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's it!{NextPage_0}

asked you...{NextPage_0}

{50_1_0_9}Umm...............{NextPage_0}

Mom, is it strange to like someone older?{NextPage_49}
Like... {32_1_244}what if somebody was
ten years older...{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Go for it.
What's wrong with that?
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}You really think so?
{41_3_0}You've got to be stronger.
No.
Who is it?

She...{32_1_244}{34_0_64}It's Lumina...
What do you think...?{NextPage_0}

I saw a wand just like this in a book.{NextPage_49}
If I practice, I can be a wizard, too!
Cool, huh?{NextPage_1}{41_3_0}Pretty cool!
It's dirty. Can I throw it out?
What kind of magic will you use?

Yeah!
{34_1_165}Heheh. It's my treasure!{NextPage_0}

I'll tell you when I learn how to use
magic. Then we can use it together!{NextPage_0}

Mom! No! Stop it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not throwing it out!
I hate you, Mom!!{NextPage_0}

I'm not throwing it out...{NextPage_0}

Gingerbread.{32_1_44}.{32_1_44}.{NextPage_49}
I'll change this house into a
gingerbread house!{32_5_220}{NextPage_49}
Everything will turn into candy and cake
and I'll eat it all up!{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Where are we going to live then?
Sounds delicious!
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}Umm... It's magic, so even if
we eat the house, it won't disappear!{NextPage_49}
{50_1_0_3}It'll just keep gettin' bigger an' bigger!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Heheh... I wonder if I can eat it all...{32_5_220}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}I gotta go potty now.♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is it, Mom?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}What's this box?
Oh, nothing.
----------x----------
I found it on the beach.{NextPage_49}
I haven't opened it yet, but I
bet there's a treasure map inside.{NextPage_49}
Mom, when I get big, I wanna go treasure
huntin'!{50_1_0_10}{NextPage_49}
So I'm not gonna open the box until
I'm a grownup! I'm gonna save it!{NextPage_1}{41_3_0}I bet it's just empty.
Let's open it now!
Something else might be inside...
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}{34_1_167}...No, I know there's a map inside.{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}It's dirty. Let's toss it.
I guess you're right.
----------x----------
{50_1_0_5}No. I don't wanna toss it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_7}Don't you open it or toss it while I'm{32_5_220}
in the bathroom or somethin'!{32_5_220}{NextPage_49}
OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_7}You're not gonna get rid of it
while I'm not lookin' are you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_2}Mom, I gotta go potty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_5}Mom, are you listening to me?
I don't want to open it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Don't open it, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_0}Mom, I gotta go potty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_11}You think so?{32_5_220}{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_29}But you've gotta have a map to go
treasure huntin' so it's gotta be inside.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom,{32_3_132} what do you think is inside?
{41_3_0}Well, I don't know...
Your future.
Money.
----------x----------
{50_1_0_9}Oh... Money?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_35}I was hopin' for something better...{NextPage_0}

{50_1_0_10}But we don't know for sure it's
money...{32_1_144}{NextPage_49}
But,{50_1_0_9}{32_3_32} maybe it is...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_1_0_10}My future?{32_5_220}{NextPage_49}
Then I'd better not open it now.{34_1_165}
I don't wanna know how it turns out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what I'll be when I grow up.{32_0_200}.{32_0_200}.{32_0_200}?{NextPage_49}

I often feel like this these days.
I get so angry, and I want to{50_1_0_4}
insult you guys....{32_5_220} I'm sorry.{NextPage_0}
