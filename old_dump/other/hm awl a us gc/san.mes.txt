{CharName_16}, have you
cleaned up your room?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_16}!
You need to eat your carrots!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll have none of that.
You eat your vegetables.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, this child.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Hello.
The weather certainly is nice
today, isn't it?{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Yes, that's true.
My daughter is still such a tomboy.
I have so many clothes to wash each day.{NextPage_49}
By the way, I hear that my Kate and your
Hugh are getting along well.
That's nice, isn't it?{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}I don't think I have to worry about that.{NextPage_49}
As long as the kids are having
fun together, that's the important
thing, don't you think?{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
{35_2}And this area has so much natural
beauty, it's a perfect environment for
raising children.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Yes, don't you think so?{NextPage_49}
Why, we used to live in the city until
recently, and I was so worried that my
daughter would get into an accident.{NextPage_49}
But we don't have to worry about traffic
congestion out here.{NextPage_49}
Of course, my husband does have a little
trouble getting to work, but...{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
{35_2}By the way, your husband seems to
play all kind of sports with your
son. That must be a lot of work.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}That's nice. My husband's just a
businessman.{NextPage_49}
He just goes to the office every day and
comes home and drinks.{NextPage_49}
I wish he'd try a little harder to advance
in the business world.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
{35_2}No, not yet.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}I thought I might go grocery shopping,
but maybe I'll just try and make due with
what we have in the house.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}By all means.
If you need to, you can always borrow
something from us.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Oh dear, I shouldn't
have kept you so long.
I'll see you later, then.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My daughter is still such a tomboy.
She gets her clothes so dirty.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}But your Hugh seems
more mature lately.
He is starting to act like a young man.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Oh, that's not true.
She talks a lot, but that's all.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
{35_2}By the way, I hear that your Hugh has
qualified for the regional marathon
trials.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Congratulations.
The regional trials aren't
easy to qualify for.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Isn't it your husband's dream
to have Hugh win a marathon
sometime?{NextPage_49}
He certainly must be happy
about it.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}My, you have an
interesting husband, haven't you?
Tee, hee, hee.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}But it certainly is nice for you.{NextPage_49}
My daughter still doesn't seem to have
interests in anything in particular. She
has no aspirations whatsoever.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}I've been thinking of having Kate
take lessons or something.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}It's nice of you to say that.
Tee, hee, hee.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}No, not yet.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}Are you sure?
That would be just great.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}I'm sure we'll love it.
Everyone says what a good cook you are.{NextPage_49}
And my husband isn't a picky
eater at all.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}I'm sorry to have kept you
talking for so long. I should be
leaving. Goodbye.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well {CharName_0}...
Good evening.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry, {CharName_0}.
How embarrassing. I'm sorry you had
to see that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You shouldn't be too easy on your
kids, but you also can't be
too strict with them, either.{NextPage_49}
But because parents love their
children, what they think is a little too
strict is probably just right.
{41_2_0}I couldn't agree more.
Maybe you are a little too strict.
----------x----------
You understand, don't you?
You'll be a fine parent. I always say--{NextPage_49}
I'm sorry.
I'm lecturing again...
I apologize, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh dear, do you think so?
Having you say something like that
concerns me.{NextPage_49}
Kate is at such a difficult age right now,
so I have to give this a lot of thought.{NextPage_49}
Raising children certainly is
difficult.{NextPage_49}
Oh dear. I'm sorry that I
involved you in this, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to finish cleaning up after dinner.
If you need something, I'm afraid you'll
have to wait a bit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hohoho.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}That's the truth.
My daughter is still such a tomboy.
She gets her clothes so dirty.{NextPage_49}
But your Hugh seems
so much more mature lately.
He seems to behave like a nice young man.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}My...
You have such an interesting husband.
Tee, hee, hee.{NextPage_49}
Life is good to you.{NextPage_49}
My daughter still doesn't seem to have any
interest in anything in particular.{NextPage_49}
She doesn't seem to have any aspirations
for the future.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um, excuse me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pardon me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You shouldn't open up shop if you
haven't anything to sell.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, if you don't have anything
to sell, I guess I'll leave.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm just looking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like the {29_0}, but
how much is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G
It's {2a_2_5}G
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
Really?
{50_15_0_3}My, that is inexpensive!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, all right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That price is a little steep.
But, OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like the {29_0},
but how much is it?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
I guess I'll pass for today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good day to you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_85}{50_15_0_7}I'm not feeling very well today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_15_0_7}I feel rather sick today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_15_0_9}Please leave me alone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_85}{50_15_0_2}Did you need something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_15_0_2}What do you want?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_15_0_2}I'm tired today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_84}Good morning.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_85}How do you do?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_85}My, you're out late today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_85}My, you're out late today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_85}Well, make yourself
at home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks good.
Could I trouble you for some?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_84}{50_15_0_3}Well, thank you very much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
h, I see.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_84}You've got something nice there.
Do you think I could have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
That's very nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_15_0_2}I don't like that kind of thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_15_0_5}Didn't I tell you I don't like it?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_15_0_2}I don't need that, thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_15_0_2}What is that you've got there?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_84}{50_15_0_3}He's rather cute.
You two look alike.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_15_0_3}What a cute child.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
What a cute dog.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you let the poor dog down?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute cat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you let the poor cat down?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not very fond of chickens.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute baby chick.
I had a pet chick when I was little.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute little chick.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_15_0_2}I told you I don't like chickens!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ducks certainly have interesting
bills, don't they? Like little smiles.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a cute duck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ducks are pretty cute when
you watch them for awhile.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's some kind of seed, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We don't have a garden, so
we don't need any seeds.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Fresh fruits and vegetables are the
best.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that milk from your farm?
Could I trouble you for some?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Fresh milk certainly is
tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that cheese for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Kate likes cheese.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess there are many kinds of
cheese, aren't there?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that butter for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
My husband said that he likes
goat butter.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that egg for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
I don't like chickens, but eggs
are quite tasty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That fish looks like it would be
good for sashimi.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that fish for me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
My husband used to catch fish and
bring them home all the time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a wild plant from around here?
Could I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Those are good in cooking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you cook that dish?
Could I have it?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
Thank you.
I'll visit you later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a strange looking hoe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an unusual hoe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe certainly looks old.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You need to wash the soil off that hoe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is there something special about that hoe?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where are you going with that hoe?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an unusual sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's an odd looking sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That certainly looks sharp.
Is it for cutting grass?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a strange sickle.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing with that sickle?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It isn't proper to go around waving a
sickle like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a watering can, isn't it?
What an unusual design.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a strange watering can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How is your watering
going?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You shouldn't wave that around
like that. You'll get everything all
wet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You have some strange things, don't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't use clippers myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you use them on your
child's hair?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those clippers are quite large.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you used those to cut your hair,
you'll bleed all over the place.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know anything about tools.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's no point in showing me that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a pretty stone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It could be made into jewelry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that you've got there?
Where did you find it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an odd thing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've heard that the wild plants around
here have some strange properties.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You found that around here, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, a record.
My husband likes to listen to those.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure my husband would be
interested in that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks like some kind of seasoning.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what it tastes like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}What an odd sound.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}How noisy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A gold medal?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet that's worth some money.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What an odd necklace.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a pretty necklace.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that, anyway?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know anything about that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a firecracker?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Quite large, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My husband is a very hard-working man.
My daughter is a little wild, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My parents were always so strict with me
that I can't help being strict with Kate.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are some strange people in these
parts. I try not to come here often.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you know Joanna?
She still hasn't returned to
Mineral Town.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer from Mineral Town
is rather greedy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer from Mineral Town
is a very nice person.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that {29_0} from Mineral
Town has shipped every crop there is.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer from Mineral Town
treats her animals incredibly
well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer from Mineral Town
digs holes in the mountains all day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard {29_0}'s from Mineral Town
has caught all kinds of fish, but I bet
he hasn't caught the kinds we have here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that {29_0} from Mineral
Town walks a great deal.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that {29_0} Farm in
Mineral Town has been going for 50 years.
I hope you last as long.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer from Mineral Town
is ignoring her farm work and just
fishes all day long. Is that true?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer from Mineral Town
really likes gold.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that the farmer from Mineral Town
has three cottages.
Isn't that nice?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} Farm in Mineral Town
has some amazing tools, I hear...
Did you know that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_15_0_3}That thing you gave me was
incredibly delicious.
Did you know it was one of my favorites?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That thing you gave me
wasn't very good.
{50_15_0_2}I'll thank you not to give me any more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me tasted
pretty good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_15_0_3}The {29_0} you gave me
was really delicious.
I'd be happy to take some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me was
out of this world!
{50_15_0_3}Sorry, maybe I got too excited there...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me tasted
just the way I like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me was delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me was
heavenly!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me was
quite good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me tasted
just fantastic.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me tasted
a little strange.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave me tasted
good, but it did have a rather
distinctive flavor.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave me was rich
and delicious.
{50_15_0_3}I'd be happy to take some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese was a little smelly.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave me
tasted good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter you gave me was rich and
delicious.
{50_15_0_3}I'd be happy to take some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter was a little smelly.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That butter you gave me
tasted good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {29_0} you gave me was
a big hit with my family.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That dish you gave me was delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That fish you caught the other day
I love how it tastes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That fish you gave me tasted
good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those wild plants you gave me the other
day were a big hit with my family.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those wild plants you gave me the other
day were delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You seem somehow different these days,
more mature.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You certainly seem to be working
hard these days.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks like you've gotten used
to farm work recently.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My daughter is such a handful.
I try to be strict with her, but...
So how about your family?{NextPage_1}Is a heavy hand the right way?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Kate has finally started to act
a bit more like a young lady.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My husband is a hard worker, but he's
too easy on our daughter.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you think of
this room?
{41_3_1}What a nice room.
It's very attractive.
I think it needs a makeover.
----------x----------
{50_15_0_3}Isn't it though?
I decorated it myself, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_84}I thought you'd think so.
{50_15_0_3}You see, interior decorating is
something of a hobby of mine.{NextPage_49}
But my husband doesn't seem to understand
it too well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_15_0_2}Do you really think so?
My husband says the same thing.
I wonder if I need to change it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lumina lives in that huge estate and
is quite a sophisticated girl.
But a bit selfish, I hear.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry I can't offer you anything.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm afraid our house is quite small, but
please make yourself at home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My, the time certainly does
fly when you have guests.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Would you care for a cup
of tea?
{41_2_1}I thought you'd never ask.
No, I really shouldn't.
----------x----------
{50_15_0_2}How rude!
I mean, of course...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_15_0_25}I see.
I'm sorry I can't get you anything.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're sure you don't want some tea?
Oh, that's right...
I'm sorry.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love this time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_15_0_10}Lalala... Spring flowers....♪
What a lovely time of year...
{50_15_0_3}Tee, hee, hee...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
On days like this I like to bring some tea{50_15_0_3}
and just relax somewhere.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It feels good out today, doesn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's so hot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard they have something in the city
that can make it cool inside.
But that can't be good for you, can it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's hot. But if I keep talking
about it, it just seems hotter, so I
won't say it. {50_15_0_3}I'm thinking it, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sun like this isn't good for
my skin.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't think I can stand many more
days like this.{NextPage_49}
Whew. {32_1_244}{50_15_0_3}It sure is hot.{32_3_132}
{50_15_0_0}Oh, I'm talking about it again.
{50_15_0_3}Tee, hee, hee.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are lots of delicious foods at
this time of year.{NextPage_49}
I wish my daughter wasn't such a
picky eater.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_15_0_7}What? You don't have to
stare at a person's face like that.{NextPage_49}
{50_15_0_0}{32_3_132}     !      {NextPage_49}
{50_15_0_25}Wait.{32_1_244}
Do I have something on my face?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_15_0_7}Autumn foods are so delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love it when the leaves start
to change color.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When my daughter Kate goes out,
she takes forever to come back home.
Same with my husband, actually.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It certainly is cold.{NextPage_49}
At this time of year, I find it hard
just to get out of bed.
I'd rather stay under the covers.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My husband can get a little loud
when he drinks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Woman like to socialize around the well.{NextPage_1}You should check it out sometime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's not like any of use actually use the
well, but we gather here anyway.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I enjoy a good conversation.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lumina is quite a piano player.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
She must practice every day to
get that good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dr. Hardy lives alone, you know.
So I sometimes bring him
some food.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's nice knowing that we have
a doctor like Dr. Hardy living
right next door.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you here to bring him something too?
...Or are you feeling ill?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The vegetables here are delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can only buy these vegetables in the
city, so my husband sometimes picks
some up for me on the way home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Vesta is so good at growing things.
Even people in the city know
about her vegetables.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now that Galen is all alone,
I sometimes bring him a little
something to eat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Galen's wife.
Nina was her name, I believe.
She died before we moved here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you bring him a little
something once in a while?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's not much here,
is there?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you come here to
shop too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you.
But I better not accept.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you.
But I better not accept.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It must be hard to work on days like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They say that the good ones go first,
and that certainly seems to be true.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}, would you sing a
song for the dearly departed?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to be going to bed soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's my bedtime, so would you
mind coming back tomorrow?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to leave in a little bit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to go out now.
So if you don't mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
See you later...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi, can I ask you a question?
Don't you think Cody is kind of
scary? Well, I used to think so.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But it was quite a surprise for me
when I saw him talking with Nami
the other day...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
And Cody had such a
gentle smile on his face.{NextPage_49}
I suppose I shouldn't be
talking about other people.{NextPage_0}
