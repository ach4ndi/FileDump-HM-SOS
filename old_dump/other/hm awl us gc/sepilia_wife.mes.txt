Hi, {2d}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you're open
for business, huh? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_4}There's nothing
here? {NextPage_49}
Your customers won't
like that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_4}You've really got
to put some effort
into it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_25}{34_1_147}You're such a
scatterbrain... {NextPage_49}
The shop is open
even though there's
nothing to sell. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You sold everything?
{50_2_0_3}I'm happy to
hear that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Am I in the way?
It's okay if I just
look, right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Do your best... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're selling all
sorts of things.
How are you doing?
{41_2_0}Selling great.
Not too good.
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}Thats good news.
Keep it up. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh...
Well you'll start
selling soon! {NextPage_49}
{50_2_0_3}Keep trying. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}Huh... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}I'm really in a
hole today. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't worry about
me, {2d}. {NextPage_49}
Just stay focused
on your work. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think I'll be
better after a
rest. {NextPage_49}
{50_2_0_9}Sorry if I made you
worried at all. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_4}...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_4}.........
Never mind... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_4}Even I can have a
bad day once in a
while. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_5}I said it's nothing.
You'll just make
me more angry. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm so tired... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}{50_2_0_3}Good morning,
{2d}! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's do our best
again today! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}I love the
morning...! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what I'll
do today... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}{2d}, how
was your work today?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You did a good job
today, {2d}. {NextPage_49}
Oh, you're not
done yet? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Do your best. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't sleep?
Neither can I. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Sometimes it's nice
to be up in the
middle of the night. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's a little cold
outside... {NextPage_49}
We should back
in the house... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't sleep?
Neither can I. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes it's nice
to be up in the
middle of the night. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} looks so
cute when asleep. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Welcome home.
Are you done with
work for today? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You should at least
relax when you're
at home. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you doing
up so late? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going home. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} woke up
and didn't see
either of us. {NextPage_49}
He was so
surprised. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Look who's here.
What are you doing
here? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks so good!
{41_3_0}Give.
Don't give.
Sell.
----------x----------
{34_1_148}Really?
{50_2_0_3}You're so nice,
{2d}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're just showing
it to me?
{50_2_0_3}{34_1_147}You're so weird! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_148}Stop saying
such silly things.
Weirdo! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks really
delicious.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's wonderful.
{41_3_0}Give.
Don't give.
Sell.
----------x----------
{34_1_148}For me? {NextPage_1}{50_2_0_3}Thank you, I'm
very happy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks for showing
that to me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_9}{34_1_148}I'm sorry, {2d}.
I can't buy that.
It's too expensive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's wonderful. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that?
You're going to
eat that right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_25}I'll pass on that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that?
Is that something
you need? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll just accept
the thought for now.{NextPage_49}
Get that the heck
out of here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}{50_2_0_3}Isn't it nice,
{CharName_1}?{NextPage_49}
See how Daddy picks
you up? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Try not to over
excite him. {NextPage_49}
He takes forever
to put him to bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {23}!
Are you a hungry
doggy today? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{23} is so cute.
Yes, he is! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {_22}.
Are you saying
goodbye? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{_22}, you've got
such angelic eyes. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello, cutie.
You're a very
pretty white. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know, thinking
of chickens... {NextPage_49}
{CharName_1} loves
chasing them
around... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Chickens really help
us out by laying
delicious eggs. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you raise your
chickens with love,
they'll lay {NextPage_1}golden eggs right? {NextPage_49}
Let's take good
care of them. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everyday you should
watch whether or not
they're happy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Aw, how cute.
His head is a
perfect circle. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hope you grow up
quickly. {NextPage_49}
It'll be nice when
you can lay eggs. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}How cute. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Oh! Hee hee hee!
How are you today
Mr. Duck? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That big beak
is very cute. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What a small little
duck.
Grow up quickly! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everyday you should
watch whether or not
they're happy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Planting seeds?{NextPage_49}
Make sure that your
planting time is
accurate. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope we can get
some large crops.{NextPage_49}
Let's take good
care of them. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, those are
your crops. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll be happy when
we have a large
harvest. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you raise crops
with love, they'll
taste sweet. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's some
delicious looking
milk. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A milk's taste
depends on how the
cow is raised. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If your cows are
raised properly,
they'll give you {NextPage_1}lots and lots
of milk in return. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be careful not to
spill any of it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's some
delicious looking
cheese. {NextPage_49}
Did you make it,
{2d}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's nice to be able
to make cheese at
home. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Next time we should
bring some to
{CharName_29}. {NextPage_49}
That's a good
idea right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's some
delicious looking
butter. {NextPage_49}
Did you make it,
{2d}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've made butter
before too. {NextPage_49}
It was hard because
it was handmade. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's great to use
butter in your
cooking. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
An egg.
Was this from one
of the hens? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We need to be
grateful to our
chickens. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh you caught
a fish?
Nice job. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today we'll have
seafood. {NextPage_49}
I wonder how we'll
prepare it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nice and fresh. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's delicious
looking wild plant. {NextPage_49}
Did you pick that
from the {Location_43_26_23}? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Location_43_30_23}
has many blessing
from Nature. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made that
by yourself? {NextPage_49}
It looks really
good.
{41_2_0}Want some?
It's all for me.
----------x----------
Really?
I'll enjoy it
nice and slow then. {NextPage_49}
{50_2_0_3}Thank you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmmm.
Next time will you
cook for me? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a good hoe. {NextPage_49}
You could really
enjoy your work
with that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You have to dig up
the ground first
to plant crops. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a very
nice hoe. {NextPage_49}
It looks very
efficient. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can harvest
a lot of crops
with that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a brand
new hoe. {NextPage_49}
Hurry up and
use it already. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope that you get
a lot of use out
of it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe is really
broken in. {NextPage_49}
You can tell that
you use it a lot. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It may be hard to
grow crops, but it's
also fun right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That hoe has really
been used. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It may not look
good , but it still
works. {NextPage_49}
It's better to have
tools that are
broken in anyway. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That sickle looks
very sharp. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be careful not to
hurt yourself. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That sickle really
looks sharp. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't injure
yourself, okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a brand new
sickle. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hope your hand gets
used to it quickly. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That sickle has
really adapted to
your hand well. {NextPage_49}
You can tell
it's used a lot. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I would help
harvest the crops,
I used that too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This sickle has
been used for a
long time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's more important
to have a sickle
that you're used to,{NextPage_1}than to have one
that is very sharp. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a very nice
watering can. {NextPage_49}
It's probably easy
to carry water. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't forget to
water the plants
everyday. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nice clean tools
make you feel better
about work. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with
your watering. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The plants will be
happy to be watered
by you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Make sure that
everyone gets
some water. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, that watering
can has seen much
better days. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess as long as
it doesn't leak
it's okay. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you're going
milking now? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure the cows
are happy if you're
using nice tools. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you're going
milking now? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's nice when we
get a lot of milk. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're going to
milk the cows
with that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It might be better
if you bought a
new one instead. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going to
shear the sheep
now? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks like it
will take a long
time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
New clippers. {NextPage_49}
Looks like you'll
be having fun next
time you shear. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They've grown
a lot of fleece
for you, so make {NextPage_1}sure you give
the sheep a good
shearing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going to
shear the sheep
now? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you gotten used
to the shears? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh dear... {NextPage_49}
Those shears have
really been used
a lot... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Broken-in tools are
always much more
productive. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You bought a new
tool?
That's nice. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good luck with
work. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That tool looks
almost broken-in. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks really
easy to use. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh dear...
It's been used
so much. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That tools really
suits you well,
{2d}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oooh...
You found such a
pretty stone. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}It's very pretty. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I could be happy by
just gazing at
the stone. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's really
wonderful. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you find that
over by {CharName_6}'s
site? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess you like
that too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks cute and
it might even be
healthy for you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It might be good to
mix in next time
you're cooking... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you want to
listen to it
together? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It'd be nice to have
music I could go
relax to. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's the ingredient
you got from {CharName_25}. {NextPage_49}
Planning on trying
it next time you
are cooking? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What flavor is this?
I want to try it
myself next time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}Oooh, that's such a
nice medal! {NextPage_49}
That's {CharName_11}'s
right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I used to have
something like
that... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a very
nice decoration... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Take good care
of it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That music looks
difficult to
play. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So {CharName_9}
gave up on this
piece? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_9}
wishes she could be
like {2d}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if she just
couldn't handle the
intense practice... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_2}...!
You surprised me.
Does that have
gunpowder inside? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_5}You can't go walking
around with a thing
like that... {NextPage_49}
And don't even
THINK of keeping
it at home. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What are you going
to do with that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay okay,
I got it... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Aunt {CharName_29} used
to bring me fresh
vegetables when I {NextPage_1}used to live in
{Location_43_31_23}
with my parents. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My parents thought
it would be good
for my health. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nobdy agrees with
Aunt {CharName_29}
when she said to {NextPage_1}come move out here
to this valley. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm glad to have
come here to
{Location_43_30_23}. {NextPage_49}
Even if I am
separated from
my parents now... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was constantly
being pressured to
get married. {NextPage_49}
My aunt would always
try to set me up
with some nice guy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_10}I wonder what my
life would be like
if I hadn't gotten {NextPage_1}married to you
first... {NextPage_49}
Hmmm...
I don't even want
to picture it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm really very
surprised your
cooking is good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You really made
this well. {NextPage_49}
Keep trying to
get better. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everyone says how
{24_128}{_f2}s animals
are superior. {NextPage_49}
{50_2_0_3}Thank goodness. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm impressed by
how well you grow
your crops. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your cooking is
better than mine,
{2d}. {NextPage_49}
Where did you
learn? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, you've
gotten really good
at raising animals. {NextPage_49}
It's almost like
you were raised
on a farm. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've gotten very
good at growing
crops. {NextPage_49}
You're probably
even better than
me at it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You really like
cooking, don't you?{NextPage_49}
If you stick to it,
you can become a
great chef. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What would happen
if you tried raising
other animals? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't really
like raising crops? {NextPage_49}
If you grow them
the right way, the
rewards are great. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, why don't
you learn a little
more about cooking? {NextPage_49}
You'd be in trouble
if I ever got sick. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I plan on living in
{Location_43_30_23}
all my life. {NextPage_49}
You too, right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope this place
never ever changes...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm really glad I
said no to the
first proposal! {NextPage_49}
I wonder what would
happen if I hadn't
married you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} thinks
{Location_43_30_23}
is wonderful. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wasn't always
so strong... {NextPage_49}
Now I can't believe
I was weak before.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think the only
reason I developed
healthy at all is {NextPage_1}thanks to my aunt
not letting me stay
inside all the time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The air here is
great. {NextPage_49}
I could just go
anywhere I want. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It was so much
colder last Spring. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All living things
are happy when it
gets warm. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_26}Mmmm...
I'm getting sleepy.
{34_1_147}Hee hee. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today's another
hot day. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, try to
stay in the shade as
much as possible. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You really need to
eat properly in
the Summer. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is {CharName_1}
getting enough
fluids? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today is a nice
cool day. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I couldn't believe
how hot it was
last Fall. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
These are the days
where time just
flows by slowly. {NextPage_49}
Perfect for
reading a lot
of books. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} loves
finding things in
the forest. {NextPage_49}
How cute. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today's another
chilly day... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you feeling
okay, {2d}? {NextPage_49}
You're not catching
a cold are you? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The tress of the
{Location_43_26_23}
wait for Spring. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_147}La la la ♪
Oh {2d}. {NextPage_49}
How long have
you been there? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Washing dishes is
fun. {NextPage_49}
They get all clean
and shiny. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I came to see that
the room isn't all
messed up. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, keep an
eye on our son
too, okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if our son
is getting along
with everybody here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what boys
are into these days. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That was great.
Time just slips away
when I read. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think a book's
impact changes each
time you read it. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, I know
your really busy
with your work, {NextPage_1}but it would be
good for you to
read occasionally. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm finally done
with the housework
for today. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's important to
relax. {NextPage_49}
Can't go on
without rest. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The skin of oranges
or potatoes is
great for sucking {NextPage_1}up any excess
oil. {NextPage_49}
I guess you learn
a few things by
being married. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Our son can help
with the housework
too, you know. {NextPage_49}
People should always
their fair share
and help out. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm grateful, but
I can't accept
right now. {NextPage_49}
Sorry...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll just take
your good intentions
for now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, doesn't
it feel great?❤{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_2_0_3}All clean,
{CharName_1}♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Poor little {CharName_1}. {NextPage_0}
