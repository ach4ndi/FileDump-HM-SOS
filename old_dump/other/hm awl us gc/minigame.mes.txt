Here is how to do it.
Push the {13}A Button{17} to
polish the tombstone.{NextPage_49}
You can't rush.
Do it nice and
gentle.{NextPage_49}
But you can't slack
off. You have 60
seconds to do it.{NextPage_49}
Are you ready?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wonderful!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Time's up!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You didn't do that
well, but thank you
for helping.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You didn't do well,
but my wife must be
happy. Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, good job.
My wife must be very
happy. Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow! My wife is very
happy! Me too!{NextPage_49}
I don't know how to
thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, dear, thank you
for polishing it so
well. I'm happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How nice of you.
You can do it much
better next time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How nice of you.
You can do it better
next time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How nice of you.
That's enough for me.
Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Here is how to do it.
Just keep pushing the
{13}A Button{17}.{NextPage_49}
The more you push,
the more milk you
can drink♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's do it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ready...?{32_7_208}
----------x----------
Go! {32_3_232}
----------x----------
Time's up! {32_7_208}
----------x----------
Well...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{29_0} wins.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Congratulations!
Good job!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you want to
challenge me?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
...That's too bad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Great!
I'm jazzed!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you wanna hear
how to do it? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
Let's do it then.
I'll go first,
alright?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Here is the rule.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll explain it
to you again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We take turns to set
lines on the board
to occupy the space.{39_48}
----------x----------
Use the Control Stick
or ＋Control Pad to
move the cursor.{NextPage_49}
Push the B Button to
move it faster.
A Button to decide.{39_48}
----------x----------
Surround an area with
your colored lines. {32_3_232}{39_48}
----------x----------
You can only set
a line where no one
has set it yet.{39_48}
----------x----------
The smallest area is
a triangle, but you
can surround several{NextPage_1}triangles at once.{39_48}{31}
If your opponent's
line was inside of
your area, it'll be{NextPage_1}yours.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If your opponent's
area was inside of
yours, it will remain{NextPage_1}as your opponent's,
though.{39_48}
----------x----------
You can make a new
area by using the
existing areas.{39_48}
----------x----------
Game's over when
there is no more
place to set a line.{NextPage_49}
Whoever has more
triangles is the
winner.{39_48}
----------x----------
Remember, you have a
limited time to make
a move.{NextPage_49}
We can be a little
flexible, but don't
think too much...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's about it.
Do you wanna hear
one more time? {40_1_0}
----------x----------
Time's up.
I guess I win this
time.{NextPage_49}
You can't think too
long over one move.
Good luck next time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Too bad. I win
this time. Did I
go too hard on you?{NextPage_49}
Sorry, sorry.
You can do better
next time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, it was so close.
I win. I'm waiting
for the next match.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh! I lost! It wasn't
even close!
Ha ha ha!{NextPage_49}
Well done, young
man. Looking forward
to the next match.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, no... I lost
this time.
You're pretty good.{NextPage_49}
I won't lose so
easily next time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ha ha ha!
It's a draw.{NextPage_49}
You're pretty good.
Let's do it again
soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's start the game.
You go first.{NextPage_0}
