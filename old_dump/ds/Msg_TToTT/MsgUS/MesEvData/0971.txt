\u1f41\u1fad\u1f4c\u2136Oh, excuse me.\u2328I was lost in thought.
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Nothing to worry about.\u2328It's fine.
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Hey, \u232a...\u2328there's something I've been\u2328wanting to ask you.
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f4c\u2136You've said "yes" a lot of\u2328times when I asked you to\u2328meet me somewhere...\u232bDoes that mean you enjoy\u2328being with me?
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Oh... I see.
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136I hardly need to tell you,\u2328\u232a, that I love\u2328plants.\u232bWhen I'm wrapped up in\u2328studying plants, everything\u2328else around me fades away.\u232b\u1f41\u1fad\u1f4c\u2136Some people think that makes\u2328me hard to get along with.\u2328
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Most of the time, that\u2328doesn't bother me. People\u2328can think what they want.\u232b\u1f41\u1fad\u1f4b\u2136If they don't like who I am,\u2328well, there's nothing I can\u2328do about that.
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136And I'm fine being alone\u2328most of the time.\u2328\u232b\u1f41\u1fad\u1f4b\u2136But sometimes I do want\u2328people to like me.\u2328Especially...certain people.
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136So, \u232a...what do you\u2328think of me as a person?
\u2332 You're very serious.\u2328 You're really cute.
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136I see.\u2328So that's the way that you\u2328think of me?
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f4c\u2136Well that's good to know.\u2328Serious, huh...?
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f49\u2136It's nothing. I just wanted\u2328to hear your opinion.\u2328Forget about it.\u232b\u1f41\u1fad\u1f48\u2136Well, it's getting late.\u2328Why don't we go?
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f4d\u2136Oh!?\u2328C-Cute...!?\u232bA-Are you serious, \u232a?\u2328I-I'm not sure what to\u2328say...
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f4d\u2136Uh...um...I just remembered\u2328I have something to do. I\u2328should go.
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f4b\u2136\u20d0Waaaaahhhhh!?!?
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f4b\u2136Owwwwww!!
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f4d\u2136It's all your fault for\u2328saying that weird thing you\u2328said... Now look at me...\u232b.........
\u1f41\u1fad\u1f4a\u2136Don't look at me, dummy!\u2328I'm going home! Bye!
