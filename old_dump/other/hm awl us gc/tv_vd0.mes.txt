....................{NextPage_1}Today I went out in
search of a big one.{NextPage_1}I rode my small boat
overcoming the
crashing waves{NextPage_1}to a fishing spot
where I could only
hear the sound of{NextPage_1}the waves and the
soft cry of the
gulls.{NextPage_1}Observing the bird's
movements, I tossed
out some bait and{NextPage_1}watched it sink deep
into the ocean.{NextPage_1}All that was left
was to sit and
wait for it...{NextPage_1}The shining sun was
very hot.{NextPage_1}Every nerve in my
fingers were eager
in anticipation.{NextPage_1}I could see my line
being moved by the
fish...{NextPage_1}...fhzzzzz...
fhzzzzz...
Now!{NextPage_1}As I reeled my line
in, I could feel
my catch hooked.{NextPage_1}Not a bad Bonito...{NextPage_1}Taking my catch up
into my boat,
I immediately began{NextPage_1}to bind and secure
it thoroughly.{NextPage_1}I then turned it
into bait for an
even BIGGER fish and{NextPage_1}tossed it back to
the ocean.{NextPage_1}The real contest has
only just begun.

.....................{NextPage_1}The Bonito was quite
lively... It made for
good bait...{NextPage_1}It was only a matter
of time before a big
one would take it.{NextPage_1}My fingers twitched
in anticipation.{NextPage_1}My line was telling
me what was going on
in the water...{NextPage_1}But it was no avail.
Nothing larger took
the bait.{NextPage_1}Even the birds had
vanished.{NextPage_1}The setting sun
reflected it's last
rays on the calm{NextPage_1}water.{NextPage_1}My spirit sank, and
I was getting tired.{NextPage_1}The sun was just
about gone. I had to
go home soon...{NextPage_1}...!! {NextPage_1}Suddenly, my line
began to pull
violently!!{NextPage_1}It was a battle
between me and the
rod.{NextPage_1}Would I pull the
catch in, or would
the catch pull me in?{NextPage_1}It had to be huge!!

.....................{NextPage_1}It had been a long
time since I had
savored the sweet{NextPage_1}taste of a battle
between myself and
a big one.{NextPage_1}But, this one was
different.{NextPage_1}It pulled and yanked
at my line as if to
sink the boat.{NextPage_1}I don't even know how
much time passed.{NextPage_1}By the time the fish
calmed down, the
light of the moon{NextPage_1}reflected off of my
boat.{NextPage_1}My numb fingers
pulled in my prey. It
felt as if I was{NextPage_1}dragging in a huge
boulder out of the
watery depths.{NextPage_1}But little by little
I carefully reeled
in my prize.{NextPage_1}From the waters I
could see the
shimmering orange{NextPage_1}color of my catch.
Now, both the sky and
the sea were dyed{NextPage_1}orange by the rising
sun.{NextPage_1}As I pulled it up
ever closer,
the size increased.{NextPage_1}It was even bigger
than my boat!{NextPage_1}I couldn't bring it
inside the boat...{NextPage_1}Having no other
choice I lashed
it to the keel.{NextPage_1}It was surely a
Marlin easily over
1000 pounds!{NextPage_1}Catching it was
hard and taking
it home was even{NextPage_1}harder... How far did
this fish pull me?
.....................{NextPage_1}Until next time!

my gut instinct.{NextPage_1}...? Out of the blue,
my boat started
moving on it's own.{NextPage_1}There was no wind,
so...why?{NextPage_1}...!?
It was the fish!{NextPage_1}It's tail was moving
back and forth. I
couldn't believe it.{NextPage_1}It was still alive!?{NextPage_1}All I cared about was
that the boat was
moving, though.{NextPage_1}...Soon enough, I
stared seeing
the land.{NextPage_1}It was night when I
reached land at last.{NextPage_1}Also, the fish's
strength had finally
given out.{NextPage_1}I just sat there and
stared at my catch
for a long time...{NextPage_1}.....................

looking for Trout.{NextPage_1}The sun's rays warmed
the river quite
nicely.{NextPage_1}It was the perfect
season for Trout
fishing.{NextPage_1}I had no doubt that
I'd catch a beauty
this day.{NextPage_1}I went to a river
where the current
was fast and the sand{NextPage_1}was firm. I tied my
line to my pole.{NextPage_1}Facing the sun, I
cast it into the
river, in the{NextPage_1}direction of
downstream.{NextPage_1}It shouldn't take
long. I could have
just gone to another{NextPage_1}place if I didn't get
a bite here.
But... I got one!{NextPage_1}It was a good one
too. Pulling with all
my might, I used a{NextPage_1}net to land the
Rainbow Trout! {NextPage_1}I knew what I was
going to have for
dinner tonight.{NextPage_1}.....................

Today I went off in
search of Carp.{NextPage_1}To catch Carp, the
first thing you need
to have is patience.{NextPage_1}After finding a good
spot to fish, you
need to go there{NextPage_1}everyday and bring
your bait.{NextPage_1}When the Carp have
gathered nearby,
start fishing.{NextPage_1}Carp only show up
during the early
morning or the late{NextPage_1}evening.
After tossing in the
bait, all you can do{NextPage_1}is to wait...{NextPage_1}Wait...wait...
sometimes for
2 or even 3 days...{NextPage_1}If you are lucky, you
may catch a great big
Carp someday.{NextPage_1}And that's how you
catch Carp.{NextPage_1}.....................

catch some Salmon.{NextPage_1}In the hotter seasons
Salmon ascend
upstream.{NextPage_1}Aim at the bottom of

Salmon Roe as bait.
After tossing it in,{NextPage_1}wait a while.
They'll be biting in
no time.{NextPage_1}If you get a big
catch, your line will
pull out.{NextPage_1}Then a great fight
between man and
fish begins.{NextPage_1}Reel in the line with
a steady hand
and drag him in.{NextPage_1}If you strain with
every last ounce
of energy, you'll see{NextPage_1}his silvery body rise
above the water's
surface.{NextPage_1}It might even be the

pull it off, your
dinner table will be{NextPage_1}graced with delicious
