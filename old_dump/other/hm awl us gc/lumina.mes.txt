Excuse me...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um, excuse me...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, nothing?
Well, guess that's
that then. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If there's nothing
I can buy, I'll
come back later.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm just taking
a look. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Doesn't seem to be
anything I'm
interested in...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really like the
{29_0}, but
how much is it?
{41_3_2}{2a_1_5}G for you.
{2a_2_5}G is fine.
That's not for sale.
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Wow, that's a great
price.
Thank you so much. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Thank you! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that so...?
I don't want it
then...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, hi {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}I'm not in my best
mood today... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}Huh, I'm bored....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Good morning!! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Oh, {CharName_0}.
Hello.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_0}.
What are you doing
here so late? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi, {CharName_0}.
How are you doing
on this fine night? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}How nice to see you
today. Please make
yourself at home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Wow! How wonderful.
That's my favorite.
Is it for me?{40_1_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Yeah!
Thank you! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}Is that so...
I'm disappointed... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Oh, I'd really like
it. Please? {40_1_0}
----------x----------
I just LOVE that
kind of stuff. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that...?
It doesn't look
very good... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}I really, really
hate that...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}Ewwww, what is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where did you get
that thing from...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Awwwwm, how cute! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}He's so cute! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}Such a cute little
puppy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Grandma really loves
cats, but I'm more
of a dog person. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Who's a cute
doggy, huh?
You are! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know you can't
take the cats
outside with you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cats are lovely...
Somewhat mysterious.
Do you like my cats?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_2}I'm not too good
around chickens.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not very good
with chickens, but
tiny chicks are OK. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_4}I told you I'm not
good with chickens! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow...
You're raising a
duck too? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if ducks
can lay eggs too...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of seed is
that? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you brought that
from your farm? {NextPage_49}
It must be nice to
grow your own
crops at home...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are different
kinds of crops to
grow, right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk looks
pretty fresh. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You made this cheese
on your farm? {NextPage_1}It looks yummy...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}Is it for me? {40_1_0}
----------x----------
That cheese looks
delicious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cheese is good for
your body. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's butter you made
on your farm. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sebastian would
probably want some
of this...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Butter, Butterrr,
Butterrrrr...{NextPage_49}
Nope, no new ideas
spring to my mind. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, an egg...
Can I have it? {40_1_0}
----------x----------
If you warm up that
egg, will a baby
chick pop out...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is there anything
interesting with
that egg? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, do you
always carry that
in your pocket? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ick, raw fish
gives me such
a nasty feeling. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sebastian uses that
when he cooks. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, do you
like wild plants? {NextPage_49}
I don't really
care for it much. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You must have gotten
that around here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, {CharName_0}!
You can cook?
{50_9_0_10}It looks delicious...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So, {CharName_0}
you can cook too,
huh? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That looks kind
of funny. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not too familiar
with tools. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's dirty... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a hoe? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a strange
looking sickle. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't go twirling
that around here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a sickle
right...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you want
me to do with it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, that looks just
like our old watering
can... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You got that from
my Grandma right? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a strange
watering can. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That's a nice
watering can! {NextPage_49}
I used to water my
plants a lot when
I was very young. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}{34_1_60}It's fun if you fill
it up all the way
and then spin around.{NextPage_49}
Hee hee... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you like watering
cans? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a strange
looking machine...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what you'd
use that for...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Those are flowers
that grow around
here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Pretty, pretty
flowers. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is that...?
Ohh, it's some kind
of seasoning...{NextPage_49}
I wonder what kind
of flavor it has. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You should show
Sebastian that
seasoning...{NextPage_49}
I'm sure he'll be
able to teach you
about it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what kind
of seasoning it is?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}What an odd sound...{NextPage_1}But it gives me a
good feeling...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of medal
is that...? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a very unique
necklace...but it's
very pretty.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you know what
kind of music that
is? {NextPage_49}
You don't, do you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I wonder what kind
of song that is...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's the music
that I gave away. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are those...
fireworks?
Wow, that's cool. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if Kassey
made that...
Or Patrick...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They're pretty when
they shoot up into
the sky. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a really
big firework. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Huh...?
What... is it? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Grandma Romana
doesn't like to be
called grandma.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I often practice my
piano when I'm at
home. {NextPage_49}
You can probably
even hear it the
outside. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My parents passed
away when I was
a baby... {NextPage_49}
Sorry for just
talking out of the
blue like that. {NextPage_49}
I don't normally
like to talk
about it myself...{NextPage_49}
But I felt it was
okay to talk
with you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer
in Mineral Town
is very rich...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer
in Mineral Town
is very popular...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's someone that
has grown every crop
imaginable. {NextPage_49}
I'm pretty sure he's
from Mineral Town. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you know Mineral
Town? There's a
farmer there who {NextPage_1}really takes a lot
of care with his
animals. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer
in Mineral Town
loves digging in {NextPage_1}all sorts of caves
for things. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard there is
someone in Mineral
Town that has caught {NextPage_1}every single type
of fish out there. {NextPage_49}
I wonder if he
caught our fish
too...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, someone walked
1,000,000 steps!
But, so what...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The farm in Mineral
Town has gone on now
for over 50 years...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard a great
fisherman lives in
Mineral Town. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer
in Mineral Town
has bad taste. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's a person in
Mineral Town who owns
3 houses. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, I just heard
this story from
someone...{NextPage_49}
Over in Mineral Town
there is someone
who's an amazing{NextPage_1}tool making genius. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That food I got
before, it was
really yummy! {NextPage_49}
Can you get me
some more please? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That {29_0}
you gave me tasted
so-so.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}I really loved the
{29_0} you
gave me last time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That {29_0}
was the best thing
I ever ate...{NextPage_49}
Seriously...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk I drank
before felt really
nutritious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The milk I got from
you felt kinda
skim...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That milk you gave
me last time was
really yummy! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave
me last time was
really yummy! {NextPage_49}
Can you bring
me some more again? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave
me before...{NextPage_49}
It had a good taste,
but it was a little
skim...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That milk you gave
me before was the
best I've ever had. {NextPage_49}
I was very impressed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That milk you gave
me last time was
tasty, but just a {NextPage_1}little strong. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}I've never had
anything better than
the milk you gave me.{NextPage_49}
But it was actually
too rich for me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}That cheese I had
before was really
yummy! {NextPage_49}
Hope you can get
me some more. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That cheese you gave
me tasted very rich.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}{CharName_0}, that
cheese you made was
really yummy. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}The butter I got
from before tasted
really good when {NextPage_1}it's spread on
bread. {NextPage_49}
I'd love to have
some more...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The butter I got
from before tastes
really unique. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}{CharName_0}, the
cheese you gave me
before tasted yummy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}{CharName_0}, the
{29_0} you
made was very good. {NextPage_49}
Please make it again
sometime. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}I really liked the
dish you gave me. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}The wild plants
you gave me were
my favorite food. {NextPage_49}
They were really
delicious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}{CharName_0}, the
wild plants you
brought me last time{NextPage_1}tasted very
delicious. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That thing you gave
me last time...
I ate it, but I{NextPage_1}forgot what it tasted
like... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, you're
working so hard. {NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_10}You're becoming a
real farmer. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}{CharName_0},
you're pretty good
at growing crops. {NextPage_49}
Grandma is quite
impressed. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everyone's saying
what a great cook you
are, {CharName_0}. {NextPage_49}
I wonder who's the
better cook though,
you or Sebastian? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, you
work so hard for your
farm. {NextPage_49}
Everyone's impressed
with you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0},
you're great
at growing crops. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got a
reputation for being
a good cook. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, people
are saying how it
looks like you're,{NextPage_1}starting to adjust to
life down on the
farm. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, people
are saying how you're
trying so hard to {NextPage_1}raise nice and
healthy crops. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, people
say how you cook a
lot at home. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did Grandma tell you
about me? {NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_9}After my parents
passed away, I...{NextPage_49}
I was brought here
and Grandma took
me in. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now, Kate is using
Grandma as a model
for her book. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Grandma Romana is so
interesting, that
she'd definitely {NextPage_1}make a great model
for a character
in a story. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if Kate
can draw pictures
like Grandma...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Kate really has an
amazing talent for
writing stories. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Grandma Romana is
a real nice person. {NextPage_49}
She's a little
strict now and then
but lovable too. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've really come to
like it here. {NextPage_49}
Grandma and Sebastian
are really nice...{NextPage_49}
{50_9_0_9}But sometimes I get
so lonely without my
parents and friends.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't tell Grandma
I said I was lonely. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what kind
of person my father
was...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now and then a place
like this is nice...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Grandma always told
me never to come
here. {NextPage_49}
I don't see any
reason why not. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really like it
here. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}This valley is a
nice place isn't it? {NextPage_49}
There's so many
interesting and
unique people. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_10}I call Grandma
Romana, "Grammy".
{34_1_60}It's a secret...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Please make yourself
at home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This season makes
me want to run
outside and play. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes you can
see the animals
chasing each other {NextPage_1}and being all
"lovey dovey". {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what it'll
be like when the snow
falls..{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh my, you didn't
come just to hear
my piano, did you? {40_0_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}I'm sorry, I'm
really not in the
mood to play today. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's good.
I wasn't really in
a piano playing {NextPage_1}mood anyway today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I love playing piano,
but I hate having to
practice it. {NextPage_49}
But if I don't
practice, I can't
play the songs {NextPage_1}that I want to
be able to play. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think I've gotten
a little better at
playing piano. {NextPage_49}
Please come and hear
me play again. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was thinking about
working harder at
my piano practice...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want to become
great at playing
piano...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want to become
even better at
playing piano...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Once in a while I
have to help out
around the house. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sebastian's too old,
so I have to help
out...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Even if I'm in the
kitchen, I don't
start tasting all the{NextPage_1}food like my grandma.{NextPage_49}
Can't let myself
get all fat now
can I? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's a lot of
cleaning up to do
after a meal. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_25}Oh, {CharName_0}.
You know a lot about
music so...{NextPage_49}
I'd like it if you'd
accept this score. {NextPage_49}
I can't play it on
my piano and can't
read it well either. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you.
But, I changed my
mind for now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Lately, piano hasn't
been much fun...{NextPage_49}
Grandma's been
on my case...{NextPage_49}
I wonder what it's
like to play piano
freely...{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}It's OK, try harder.
It's OK, have fun.
----------x----------
I just don't know
how I can try any
harder! {NextPage_49}
It's just too
much for me! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_9}Perform...for people.{32_1_144}
Sing...a song...{32_1_144}
I can't do that. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_9_0_3}You're right!{32_1_144}{NextPage_1}I feel that like
I just remembered
something very {NextPage_49}
important that
I'd forgotten. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if you'd
listen to my story...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I started playing
when I was 3.
Grandma taught me. {NextPage_49}
She always praised
me for how careful I
was not to hit the {NextPage_1}wrong notes when
I was playing. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But, soon I felt
more and more
pressure to do well. {NextPage_49}
The better I did,
the more she
expected of me...{NextPage_49}
I was told how my
mother would be
proud. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Suddenly, I became
scared of hitting the
wrong notes...{NextPage_49}
I thought of how
disappointed my
Grandma would be. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I was trying
to be like my mother
for Grandma. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's not what
Grandma wanted. {NextPage_49}
So, she told me to
just practice at my
own pace. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, I feel so
much better. {NextPage_49}
It's just like you
said, {CharName_0}. {NextPage_49}
I feel like I can
have fun when I
play again. {NextPage_49}
Thank you so much,
{CharName_0}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Grandma was
listening. That's my
painting, right?{NextPage_49}
I'm so embarrassed! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
"I loved it", that's
what I said. I still
love it now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Poor Van. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, did
you just see that?
Really. {NextPage_49}
...{NextPage_49}
I just might have a
talent for painting! {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0},
I... always thought
of you as the big{NextPage_1}brother I never had. {NextPage_49}
...Can't cry...{32_5_220}
I'm going to keep
playing piano. {NextPage_49}
I hope you'll keep
watching over me
from time to time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27},
would you please sing
a song for
{CharName_0}. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I'll be going
to sleep so...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Time for bed.
Would you please
leave now? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I've got to be
on my way...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to get going.
So long. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you'll excuse
me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have a favor to
ask of you. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {32_1_44}{CharName_0}.
Were you here this
whole time? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
......... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0},{32_1_244}
do you like
paintings? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hee, hee. {32_1_44}
I'll paint your
portrait next time. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hee, hee, hee. {32_1_244}
I'll be off now.
Take it easy okay? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sebastian went off
in search of a spare
paintbrush. {NextPage_49}
I wonder where he
is now...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh! {32_1_244}
Sebastian. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you have a
second? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Okay, {CharName_0}.
I'll be seeing you♪{NextPage_0}
