To be a good spy,
I need to protect my treasure
from the bad guys.{NextPage_1}I'll need plenty of luck!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Started a bath for Mom...
She really works too hard...
I really worry about her.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have a new friend in my room,
a huge teddy bear.
But I have a feeling{NextPage_1}he's actually a spy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom bought me a stuffed animal.
Doesn't she realize I'm way too old
for such things?{NextPage_1}Either way, something tells me
this teddy bear has
some dark secret to it. Definitely.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Either way, something tells me
this teddy bear has
some dark secret to it. Definitely.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_13} can run real fast.
He's very cool.
I wish I could run{NextPage_1}as fast as {CharName_13}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm interested in
many kinds of sports
from all over the world.{NextPage_1}Athletes are really cool.
I wish my mother was
an athlete.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I tried to jump up to a branch
and I think I touched it.
If I practice jumping,{NextPage_1}I might be able to pull myself up
and sit on the branch.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm beginning to think
that I need to workout, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
To be popular with girls,
I have got to play sports. But maybe
there's no point out here in the country.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what brand of shoes
{CharName_13} wears.
I can't help thinking about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I realized recently that
my clothes are not suited for sports.
My shoes are too heavy, in particular.{NextPage_1}They may be helping me develop
my leg muscles,
but I can't say for sure.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Food is important in keeping fit.
You need lots of protein,
or your muscles won't grow.{NextPage_1}I wonder what {CharName_13}
eats every day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Animal movements can be used in sports.
I wish I could move
as gracefully as a cat does.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It seems like many people here
have musical instruments.
I want an instrument, too.{NextPage_1}But I don't think Mom would like it
if I asked her to buy me one,
so I'll keep quiet about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_20} is great with the guitar.
He's really cool.
I'd be really happy {NextPage_1}if he'd play for me alone.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Grandpa {CharName_7} said
my Mom has poor pitch.
I wonder if I have{NextPage_1}poor pitch, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like instruments.
They allow you to vent your frustrations.
It might help me deal with
this weird feeling I have inside.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I sometimes feel like listening to loud,
heavy music. Mom's records just won't do.
Would {CharName_36} have something cool?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They say music can heal.
Come to think of it, my soul
is at peace somewhat
when I'm listening to music.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Life with music is much more fun
than life without music.
Of course, I've never actually lived life
without music.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's interesting what kind of music
people listen to.
{CharName_14} seems like he's into classical{NextPage_1}music, so it'd surprise me if
he listens to pop music.
There's a kind of music that matches{NextPage_1}each person's character.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's hard to describe sounds with words,
as you never know how others hear
the sounds you hear.{NextPage_1}I sometimes wish I could borrow
someone else's ears. Would it allow me
to hear an entirely new world of sounds?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My drawing book has many pictures
I drew when I was small.
But I can't tell what they are at all.{NextPage_1}Mom says they bring up fond memories.
What does “fond” mean?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I started a drawing of the sea yesterday.
But when I went back today,
the sea was a totally different color.{NextPage_1}I couldn't figure out why.
{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I often see {CharName_21} thinking
near the rock in the swamp.
I think that's really wonderful.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is it like
to express yourself?
Drawing something, maybe?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm starting to prefer darker colors.
Black, silver...
Both are really cool colors.{NextPage_1}Hope I'm not out of my mind or anything.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish I could draw with a lady model.
If she'd model for me.
I'd draw the best drawing ever.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What is the theme behind {CharName_21}'s work?
Why does he insist on creating it
by hand?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are things created by human intelligence
not part of nature?
They may be artificial,{NextPage_1}but artificial and natural do not need
to be opposites. Aren't we part of nature?
I'm totally confused now.{NextPage_1}I think I'll call it a day.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What defines an artist? Are you an artist
because you call yourself one?
What is art, anyway?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_8}'s cat
can't go outside on its own.
I pity it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Our farm is more fun
when there are all sorts
of animals here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I saw a turtle in the swamp today.
It was so huge!
People don't see it often{NextPage_1}even though it's so big.
It must be very good at hide-and-seek.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel more and more that
I'm just another animal.
And I feel that even {CharName_8}'s cat{NextPage_1}is smarter than me. Seriously.
It's kind of depressing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I saw an owl in the woods.
Predatory birds are so cool!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Would the girls in the city be attracted
to a guy born and raised on a farm?
Probably not.{NextPage_1}I guess I'm just a country bumpkin.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if the animals prefer some faces
over others. Just wondering.
This could be pretty important{NextPage_1}in running a farm, actually.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if I'm more like
a cat or a dog...
A cat, perhaps. No, maybe more of a dog.{NextPage_1}Mom would probably be a dog. I guess.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It'd been a while since I saw a lizard.
Lizards really look like dinosaurs.
Are they the result of evolution?{NextPage_1}Or have they not evolved enough?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can smell all sorts of smells
in {CharName_29}'s fields.
Sometimes it really reeks! {NextPage_1}But I guess that smelly thing
is important in growing
crops.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I found a pretty flower growing
and wanted to give one to {CharName_16}
but she told me she didn't want it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I found a funny-shaped leaf today.
It had bugs on it, though,
so I threw it away.{NextPage_1}That was too bad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The “me” as I am now
is like a cactus with sharp needles.
Get too close, and you'll get hurt!
Yeah.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's important to be able to appreciate
the beauty of wild flowers, but I
can't really do that now.
It's too embarrassing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Does {CharName_30} help with the farm work?
I hardly ever see him helping.
Wouldn't it be hard for {CharName_29}{NextPage_1}to work on that big field alone?
I guess she can handle it, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Near the city new technologies are being
developed for future farming.
I'd sure like to take a look myself.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Growing good crops
is practically impossible without
hard work on the grower's part.{NextPage_1}Isn't there an easier way to do it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If crops grew 10 times faster,
it might take away
the fun of farming.{NextPage_1}Just an idea I had.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The roof of {CharName_19}'s house
is always crackling with a weird noise.
It does that on rainy days too.{NextPage_1}{CharName_19}'s experiments
never seem to stop.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like studying.
But {CharName_16} doesn't.
I wonder why?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I made a great discovery today.
Mom's voice changes depending on
who she's talking to.{NextPage_1}When she talks to other people,
it's higher than when she talks to me.
I wonder why?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't help asking myself
all sorts of stupid questions.
“Why”, “what for”, “since when”...{NextPage_1}Somebody, just tell me the answers!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_19} might be growing something weird
in his flowerbed.
I should ask him some time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It might be interesting to analyze cooking
scientifically. Just an idea I had.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's a lot to learn even for grownups.
Just a little taste, and the next thing
you know, you're up to your neck in it.{NextPage_1}One answer leads to 10 more questions.
I guess that's how you build up knowledge
over time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Finding answers to your questions is fun.
I kind of understand why {CharName_19}
likes his experiments so much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Not enough books here.
I've read them all
and I want more.{NextPage_1}I bet there's tons of books in the city.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom always looks busy.
But she's real kind to me.
She's a great mom.{NextPage_1}Dad's always so nice to me.
I love him.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom always seems to be so
busy. I think it's great for a
woman to work so hard.{NextPage_1}Dad's always so nice to me.
I love him.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom always seems to be so
busy. I think it's great for a
woman to work so hard.{NextPage_1}Dad's always so nice to me.
I love him.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Me or the farm, which is more important
to Mom?
I'd bet it's the farm.{NextPage_1}All she thinks about is her work.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If I took over this place in the future,
would I do as well as
Mom is doing?{NextPage_1}Nope, probably not...
Gee, this stinks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what Mom really think
about her work?
It seems like it's pretty difficult work,{NextPage_1}for a woman.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Recently I'm beginning to think
Mom is truly awesome.
I was born and raised on this farm,{NextPage_1}so farm work comes naturally to me.
But Mom left her previous life
and began running a farm here.{NextPage_1}It must have been hard work.
Harder than I can imagine.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if Mom plans to have me
take over the farm.
I bet she is.{NextPage_1}And I probably should...{NextPage_0}

Mom is great with a hoe.
It's way too heavy for me to use.
I think she's awesome.{NextPage_0}

----------x----------
I wonder what Mom thinks
about {CharName_29}'s farm.
Let's face it, she's our rival.{NextPage_1}Are all grownups such hypocrites?
{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought this was a dairy farm.
Why is Mom putting so much effort
into growing crops?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I often feel that Mom
is really suited to working
on a farm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom is as quick with the hoe
as anyone else, but at her age,
she should be more careful.{NextPage_1}I'm worried that he might hurt her back.
I bet she thinks so, too.
{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think we can keep the farm going
just by growing crops.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom is as quick with the hoe
as anyone else, but at her age,

Mom is really a great cook.
Even Dad says he's impressed.
He's really proud of her.{NextPage_0}

----------x----------
Mom is really a great cook.
Even Dad says he's impressed.
He's really proud of her.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Men should be able to cook, too.
Mom should teach Dad how
to cook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom's cooking is delicious.
She should open a diner or something.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom's cooking is delicious.

----------x----------
Seeing Mom cook made me
want to try myself, but I messed up.
She's so great.{NextPage_1}I'll never be able to cook like she does.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom looks really cool
when she's filleting fish.
I'd never be able to do it like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Seeing Mom cook made me
want to try myself, but I messed up...
She's so great.{NextPage_1}I'd never be able to cook like she does.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looks like Mom is rich.
{CharName_36} told me so too.
But we don't really have any stores here,{NextPage_1}so where is she going to use all
that money? Grownups are weird.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
Mom really likes her money.
How does she plan to use all that money?
Does she need it out here in the country?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Money is a big deal,
even out here in the country.
Mom scares me sometimes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom really likes her money.
How does she plan to use all that money?
Does she need it out here in the country?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom has earned so much money,
I wonder why she doesn't take Dad
on a vacation or something.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes I feel like shouting,
“You can't take it with you, Mom!”{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We should have enough money for someone
living out here in the country.
Or am I just being naive?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom doesn't talk very much.
But she sometimes talks a lot.
I wish he talked more.{NextPage_1}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom doesn't talk very much.
But she sometimes talks a lot.
I wish he talked more.{NextPage_1}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom doesn't talk very much.

----------x----------
I wonder why Mom
decided to marry Dad?
She doesn't look like she'd be the type{NextPage_1}to marry anyone. It's a mystery to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad always seems to look so young.
But it seems to me like the men
here never get much older.{NextPage_1}Or is that just my imagination?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder why Dad
decided to marry Mom?
He doesn't look like he'd be the type{NextPage_1}to marry anyone. It's a mystery to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The reason why I fell in love with {CharName_9}
is probably that I grew up watching
Mom and her freewheeling ways.{NextPage_1}I guess most people don't fall in love
with someone this much older
than they are.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
Why do Mom and Dad come
barging into my room all the time?
Geez!{NextPage_1}Poor Mom. she's not very tough, is she?
Why doesn't Dad do something about it?
Our life isn't easy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why do Mom and Dad come
barging into my room all the time?
Geez!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why do Mom and Dad have come
barging into my room all the time?
God!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad will make a great Grandpa.
But I guess whether he really becomes
a Grandpa or not is up to me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do I love {CharName_16} because she's like Mom,
or because she's totally different?
I bet it's because she's different.{NextPage_1}Kind of funny, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's say I marry {CharName_16}.
Mom would probably have trouble
getting along with her.{NextPage_1}Gee, what am I thinking?
I don't even know if she likes me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom keeps telling me
to study hard.
But she never really teaches me{NextPage_1}how or what to study.
I wish she did.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
Dad isn't much of a cook.
I'm starting to think that Mom
fell for his looks alone{NextPage_1}when she decided to marry him.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Dad scolds me a little too much. I guess
he's just trying to be a good father, but
he's overdoing it. Gosh, gimme a break!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When Mom doesn't have her makeup on
she looks... different.
I wonder if Dad knows this?{NextPage_1}If he did, would he have married her?
But if he hadn't, I wouldn't even be here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_16} kinda reminds me of Mom.
Is that why I'm attracted to her?
I wonder what she thinks of me?{NextPage_1}I don't really want to think
about it...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom kept calling me
a “handsome boy”, so I
spent some time looking in the mirror.{NextPage_1}Now I know why she says that.
I really look like her.
I have a narcissist for a mother.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom still doesn't it have it together.
She made a fuss again over a lost pendant.
I guess people never really change.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Grown-ups say I shouldn't
go to the Blue Bar alone at night.
I want to grow up soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Somebody said I looked a lot like
Mom.
Well duh! She's my mother!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom sometimes goes invisible
after eating mushrooms in the woods!
I want to try too, but Dad would{NextPage_1}yell at me for eating something
I found on the ground.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The other night, Mom sounded
like she was having nightmares.
I was worried.{NextPage_1}I wonder what it was?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Today I asked Dad
how he got together with Mom
but he started blushing {NextPage_1}and wouldn't say anything.
Why won't he tell?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I often talk back to Mom these days.
It's not like I don't feel bad about it,
but just looking at Mom annoys me.{NextPage_1}I wonder why...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet Mom thinks I'm annoying.
I bet she wishes I'd never been born.
I could almost swear she does.{NextPage_1}※SIGH※
Gee, this is depressing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I want to grow up and be
a real man soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
I think I'm just about old enough
to get married.
But I don't even have a girlfriend.{NextPage_1}I've gotta find myself a good girl, fast.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My stomach is killing me.
I ate way too much last night.
I hope I didn't offend anyone.{NextPage_1}I'm not sure if I did or not.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There's an unknown world outside this
valley. I could live without seeing it,
but I think it might be better{NextPage_1}if I did.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
I can run pretty fast,
so I think someday
I'll be an athlete.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_13}'s father told me
that I should become an athlete
because I can run so fast.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can run pretty fast,
so I think someday
I'll be an athlete.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm pretty sure.
One day, I'll be running faster than {CharName_13}...
----------x----------
I'm pretty sure.
One day, I'll be running faster than {CharName_13}...
----------x----------
I'm pretty sure.
One day, I'll be running faster than {CharName_13}...
----------x----------
I think I'm beginning to see my goal.
I want to see how far I can get
in the world of professional sports.{NextPage_1}Unless I change my mind, of course.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
To be a real professional athlete,
I need to find a sponsor.
If I'm good enough,{NextPage_1}a sponsor will appear sooner or later.
I wonder how good I am?
Am I competitive enough?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think I'm beginning to see my goal.
I want to see how far I can get
in the world of professional sports.{NextPage_1}Unless I change my mind, of course.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mom told me
I sing pretty well.
Maybe I should be a singer someday.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I sing, animals come
and gather around me.
Maybe my voice{NextPage_1}is something magical.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When the birds sing, I hear musical notes.
When the cows moo, I hear notes, too.
I think all sounds are notes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
My falsetto is getting better.
If I continue practicing,
I could sing 4 octaves easily.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've discovered my talent.
It's music.
I don't even think about it, but...{NextPage_1}I always have melodies in my head.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I pull my chin in, it's easier
to sing higher. It's really something.
I can sing a wider range of songs now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think I'm beginning to see my goal.
I'm not totally sure yet,
but a career in music sounds interesting.{NextPage_1}Unless I change my mind, of course.
{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I saw a TV special on G. McCoy's music.
I hope to move people with my songs, but
he does that with a single instrument.{NextPage_1}I was totally impressed and now want to
play an instrument of some sort.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think I'm beginning to see my goal.
I'm not totally sure yet,
but a career in music sounds interesting.{NextPage_1}Unless I change my mind, of course.
{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I let {CharName_23} see my drawing.
He said I was good at using colors.
It made me kind of happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I let {CharName_21} see my drawing.
He said I had “potential.”
What's “potential”? Does it taste good?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can draw circles pretty well now,
so I drew Dad just by using circles.
But it didn't look like him.{NextPage_1}It's not easy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've discovered my talent.
It's art.
I wonder where or who it came from...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's hard to draw things lifelike, but
it's also hard to draw things abstractly.
I've gotten bored with lifelike drawings.{NextPage_1}I tried doing it a little, but they
didn't look good and I threw them away.
Next time, maybe. Next time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I feel I'm good at drawing,
but I'll need tons of practice
to be able to draw like I want to.{NextPage_1}My drawing skills need improvement,
and I need work on using colors.
The hardest part is that{NextPage_1}I can't decide what I want to express.
I need to give it some thought.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think I know what I want to do with
my life. I want to do something creative.
I'm not entirely sure, but...{NextPage_1}I think that's what I should do...
...Unless I change my mind, of course.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Someone said creating was
talking with one's inner soul,
and I totally agree.{NextPage_1}To make something good, you need to be
honest about your feelings,
and not be swayed by others' opinions.{NextPage_1}I must remember this, even if
I become a professional artist.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's face it, being an artist
isn't going to earn you much money.
But I'd still like to earn a living{NextPage_1}with my own work. And I can't
keep relying on my parents forever.
It's a real dilemma, I tell you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was born on a farm, so I'll be a
great farmer someday!
I think.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
