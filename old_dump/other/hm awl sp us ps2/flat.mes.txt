We've been here since before there
were people living in this place.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't take too much food away
from the forest, or there

The people in {Location_43_30_23} are funny.
So we go to see them all the time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, that's amazing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't use that here.{NextPage_0}

We don't need those.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We know about those, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We carry those to all places... to help
flowers spread.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a baby plant.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that your dinner?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm hungry...{NextPage_0}

You seem interested in
the pots.{NextPage_0}

{CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We're very happy that you've
come to see us today,
{CharName_0}!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}

Nak once got himself stuck in a
pot you know.
Heh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You should be careful not to fall
in a pot yourself,
{CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm a good Harvest Sprite, so I
don't fall into pots.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Mr. Pots is scary when he's angry...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nik gets into trouble with
Mr. Pots a lot.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm a good Harvest Sprite, so I
don't get into trouble.{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got courage,
{CharName_0}.
