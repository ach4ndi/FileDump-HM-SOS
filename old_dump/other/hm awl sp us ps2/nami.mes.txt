A {13}Blue Feather{17}..... What is this?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's this supposed to be?
{41_2_0}Marry me!
It's nothing!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, OK then...
That's a pretty feather.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't you have a girlfriend?
What are you thinking?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why me?
No, no. This has to be a mistake.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um...
You already showed that to me, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know...
...You're pretty pushy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...What's the big deal?
People have to live their own lives.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't really want to understand it.{NextPage_49}
I'm me.
You're you.{NextPage_49}
I'm living my life the way I
want to live it.{NextPage_49}
It's just that simple.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But I bet that even if you've
got some problems with your life,
you're not really unhappy.{NextPage_49}
You just wanted someone
to listen to you.{NextPage_49}
...Right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...That's OK.
It happens to all of us.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
..........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.......Can I really come
back?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
....Yes. I guess there's no place
for me here. I'm going to try
and find someplace where I belong.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, well I guess I should do what
seems right to me.{NextPage_49}
And I wanted to taste Ruby's cooking
again, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I wondered where you were.
Drinking with the boys, eh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Relax. Take your time. Just don't
expect me to serve you any snacks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
I'm going back now.
I'm beat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How can men always save just enough
strength to go drinking?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are ducks in our pond...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where could they have come from...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Should we keep them?
{41_2_0}Keep them.
Don't keep them.
----------x----------
Oh, good.
Well, what should we name them?
What's a good name for a male duck?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's too bad.
I guess we'd better let them go then...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Input_128}?{32_3_232}
And what about the female?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Input_128}, huh?{32_3_232}
We'd better show them the {Location_43_21_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't mind me...
I certainly didn't come here to see you.
Go on and finish your work.{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}You're just going to stand there?
OK, do what you like.
----------x----------
Oh, never mind.
I guess I'll be going home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?
Then I guess I'll just relax a bit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, I'm going to go
home soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm jealous of you, {CharName_0}.
It must be interesting living on a farm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's OK.
There's nobody here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't think drinking with me
will be very much fun.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How did I end up here?
Hmm... I'm not really sure.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I didn't really have a reason.
I just like traveling around.
{41_2_0}Turn to {CharName_4} and nod.
Hmmm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
........
Well, I have to go now. Bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Why did you come here,
{CharName_0}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So that's who that {CharName_7} guy is
in relation to you. I wondered about that.
...Can you make money running a farm?
{41_3_0}The money's pretty good.
It's pretty tough.
I haven't really thought about it.
----------x----------
.........
I have to go now.
Good luck with your work. Bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm back!
Boy, I'm hungry!
{CharName_25}, what's for dinner?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's wrong?
What're you staring at?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Darn...
I forgot that I already left
here...{NextPage_49}
I got hungry and I remembered
Ruby's cooking...{NextPage_49}
...........
Well, for the moment, let's eat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Darn.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Oh.
...Is this letter for me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So that means I have to
get a job, I guess.
Hmm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_24}...
Could I work here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
....No. Never mind.
Just forget I said that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um, {CharName_0}...
Do you think I could work at
{Location_36_2_128}{_0f}arm{17}?
{41_2_0}Sure.
I don't think so.
----------x----------
....No. Never mind.
Just forget I said that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yeah, I guess not.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
..............{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You scared me.
I guess I looked kinda pitiful just then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I really liked it here, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to be leaving soon.
I ran out of money.{NextPage_49}
And I guess nobody in
{Location_43_30_23} is looking to
hire anybody, so...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}...
Thanks for everything.
{41_2_0}You too. It was fun.
Why don't you stay with me?
----------x----------
...But anyway, I plan to stay
here for the rest of the
winter.{NextPage_49}
Well, bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd love to....!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't mind me...
I certainly didn't come here to see you.
Go on and finish your work.
{41_2_0}You're just going to stand there?
OK, do what you like.
----------x----------
I told you not to worry about me...
I-I'm going gome.
Oh brother...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?
That was easy. I guess I'll just
kick back and relax, then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}H-hey! What're you looking at?
Stop staring at people and get to work!
{50_4_0_3}....Bye!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I-It's OK.
There's nobody here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well... I uh... I don't think drinking
with me will be much fun.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's with you all of a sudden?
...Why did I come here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
!
I-I s-should be going home.
Bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well then...uh... I know!
Why don't you tell me why
you came here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {CharName_0}.
What're you doing here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...N-no... Forget it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Y-yeah.
Never mind!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}...
Thanks for everything.
{41_2_0}You too. It was fun.
Why don't you stay with me?
----------x----------
...But anyway, I plan to stay
here for the rest of the
winter.{NextPage_49}
...{CharName_0}.
I'm sorry for before.
You know, about the {13}Blue Feather{17} and all.{NextPage_49}
It was nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Just a minute.
I....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll do it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning, {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_24}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you so much.
Can I come back and visit you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you too, {CharName_25}.
You're a heck of a cook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes.
It's all thanks to {CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well bye! See you later!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
M-marriage?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is all very sudden...
Oh my...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey! Are you following me?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK, let's do it.
Let's get married.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You like this kind of thing, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess you didn't have a girlfriend
after all. OK, let's do it.
Let's get married.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is all very sudden...
I was all set to leave here.
Oh my...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see... I could stay here...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Congratulations.{NextPage_49}
Oh, and by the way...
We talked about me coming to live here,
but of course that's out of the question.{NextPage_49}
That's all. Bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure you'll be very happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, are you here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um, I've got something I want to
talk about. Do you have a minute?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you found a girlfriend or anything?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well... I don't suppose I could stay here?{NextPage_49}
I'd like to stay in {Location_43_30_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're the only person I can ask this of.
...No?
{41_2_0}Live together.
Stay single forever.
----------x----------
Really?
Great, you really saved my butt.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now that that's decided, we have to
go tell {CharName_24} and {CharName_25} and...
Well, everybody!{NextPage_49}
Thank you so much. Well, bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I should've accepted when
you proposed to me, huh?
...But anyway, it was fun.{NextPage_49}
Well, I guess I should be going.
Bye...!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh good. I don't know what I would've
done if you weren't here!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The thing is, I'm out of money, so I'm
going to have to leave {Location_43_30_23}
soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So I thought I'd ask you if I could
maybe live here. You seem pretty cool.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not asking you to look after me or
anything. I just need a place to crash.
{CharName_0}, can you help me out?
{41_2_0}Live together.
Stay single forever.
----------x----------
Really?
Great, you really saved my butt.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now that that's decided, we have to
go tell {CharName_24} and {CharName_25} and...
Well, everybody!{NextPage_49}
This should be fun. Well, bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Single forever...?
Am I that bad...? I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought it was a good idea,
but I guess I wasn't being realistic.
Now what'll I do...?{NextPage_49}
Well, I'll think of something.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...
Since I already told you about my leaving
I thought I could approach you, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_24}... It's OK. Really.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry. It's nothing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't care, right?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wha-?
That's... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know about that, {CharName_24}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...I'm sorry. I didn't know.
I'll take it next time. Thank you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Could I go and tell
{CharName_25} myself?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{CharName_24}, are you satisfied?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I should have accepted
your proposal, then.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see... Goodbye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, {CharName_24} was saying
that maybe I could stay at your
house.{NextPage_49}
That'd be nice, but...
It's not possible, right?
We haven't really even talked much.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What? Did I really say that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}! Thank you!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I, uh... Yes!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I, uh... Yes!{NextPage_1}{CharName_0}! Thank you!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Could I go and tell
{CharName_25} myself?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...{CharName_24}, are you satisfied?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thank you too, {CharName_0}.
I kind of regret not talking to you
more, but...{NextPage_49}
It's OK. Well, bye!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm...
I'm sorry, but I don't think I'm
ready to get married.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi. Done with your work?
{41_2_0}Is that seat taken?
Let's have a drink.
----------x----------
........
{41_2_0}Ask why {CharName_4} came to {Location_43_30_23}
Talk about why you came to {Location_43_30_23}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well... I don't suppose I could stay here?{NextPage_49}
I have to leave the {Location_43_35_23}, but I
want to stay in {Location_43_30_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know this is kind of sudden.
Hey, nice room.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All right, I'll stay here...!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Come to think of it, didn't I turn you
down when you proposed to me?
I guess this would never work then.{NextPage_49}
Well, I guess I should be going.
Bye...!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...
No, don't worry about it.
It can't be helped.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you want something?
{41_2_0}Is that seat taken?
Let's have a drink.
----------x----------
..........
{41_2_0}Ask why {CharName_4} came to {Location_43_30_23}
Talk about why you came to {Location_43_30_23}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hahaha. Really?
Well, good luck.
I have to be going.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wha-?
Your story?
If it's interesting, I'll listen.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But having to leave {Location_43_30_23} is
hard...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...You...and me? I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, I'm supposed to take that, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...But why? Can't we just keep on
like we've been doing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll be right back.{32_3_32}
----------x----------
I heard you're getting married.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello?
I heard you're getting married.
...Aren't you here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, isn't it nice
to have your Daddy play with you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...{NextPage_49}
I'd like {CharName_1} to have a
wide variety of interests and not
concentrate too much on any one thing.{NextPage_1}What do you think?
{41_2_0}Good idea.
I just want {CharName_1} to be healthy.
----------x----------
Yes, I think so too.
But I guess it doesn't matter what I
think. It's really up to {CharName_1}.{NextPage_1}If {CharName_1}'s healthy, I'm happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, that's true.
I'm sure {CharName_1} will have some
ideas about it too.{32_4_176}{NextPage_49}
Yes,{32_0_200} health is the most important.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, it's time for bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that's right, {2d}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There isn't much food in the {2b_2}.
Could you put some more in?
Thanks.{NextPage_49}
Night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} just went to bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think {CharName_1} might be cut out
for farm work. Why today......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} was trying to get into
the Tool Shed so I followed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

 {u_805a}Humdedumdeduuum{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}That's right, {CharName_1}.
Just wait a bit longer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Very good, {CharName_1}!
You've got to sing that song for Daddy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}! {CharName_1} is
such a good singer!{NextPage_49}
That child learned that song in no time!
I bet our child's got a talent for music!
{41_2_0}I'm sure you're right!
Isn't it a little early to tell?
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}Wow! What a future our child will have!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}You think so.......?{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_26}I guess I am being a little silly.{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_3}But if our child is this talented,
I think we have to try and be more
supportive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
Hmm............{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Morning!
You're up early.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's morning, {CharName_1}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
I'm going to go to bed.
Night.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, it's time for bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see. I guess you want to meet all the
monsters that come out after bedtime...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK, time for bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_0}C-come on guys. It's no big deal.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}....Oh come on.
You don't have to get so excited about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_0}Uh....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_25}...Yeah. I wanted to eat
{CharName_25}'s cooking again, and...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Thanks, {CharName_24}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_0}So anyway...{32_3_232}
I've decided to stay here a little while.{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Stay as long as you like.
Eveyone'll be happy.
----------x----------
{50_4_0_26}Haha. Yeah...{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_0}.....
{50_4_0_3}I'll think about it.{NextPage_1}{50_4_0_0}Well, bye.{32_3_232}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}...Thanks.{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_0}......
{50_4_0_3}Yeah, I like it here.{NextPage_1}{50_4_0_0}Well, bye.{32_3_232}
----------x----------
Hey {CharName_1}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}I'll have to go look for that child...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_0}{2d}!
{CharName_1} still hasn't come home.
I'm going to go take a look around.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_0}Is it that late already?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}I'm going to go take a look around.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_0}Hey, it's bedtime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_1}...All right.
I'm glad you're OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All right, {CharName_1}, time for bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Good night!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's pretty late.... Do you think
{CharName_1} is asleep yet...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Welcome home.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I just put {CharName_1} to bed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
By the way... {CharName_1}'s been
watching a lot of TV lately...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Hey, do you think {CharName_1} could
be interested in farm work?{NextPage_49}
That child seemed so interested in
watching the farm report!
What do you think, {2d}?
{41_2_0}I bet you're right!
It's too early to tell.
----------x----------
Yes.
I bet {CharName_1} will be helping
you with your work before we know it.{NextPage_49}
Won't that be nice?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_26}...I suppose you're right.{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_26}...But if you set a
good example, {CharName_1} will
be sure to like farming.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_1}{u_805a}A necklace of{u_805a}{32_7_208}
{u_805a}white flowers...{u_805a}{32_7_208}
{u_805a}Lalalaaaa{u_805a} Lalalalaaa{u_805a} Lalala...{32_7_208}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_1}A necklace I got
from you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be good, {CharName_1}.
Wait just a little longer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}! That was very good!
You should sing that for Daddy!{u_805b}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}!{NextPage_49}
{CharName_1} is such a
good singer!{NextPage_49}
That child learned that song in no time!
I bet our child's got a talent for music!
{41_2_0}I'm sure you're right!
Isn't it a little early to tell?
----------x----------
Yep. A future musician!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}Maybe so...{32_3_232}
{50_4_0_26}I guess I'm being a little silly...{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_3}But if our child has this much
talent, I think we have to be supportive!
{CharName_1} may get even better.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}What're you drawing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}.......Daddy???{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_25}....Good job...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} drew this picture.
What do you think it is?
{41_3_0}Flowers.
Me, of course.
Don't know.
----------x----------
Yes. Flowers......
...I think it's pretty good.
{50_4_0_3}I think our child has talent...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}...Seriously?
If you say so, {2d}...{NextPage_49}
...!?
{50_4_0_3}Do you think {CharName_1}
might be some kind of artistic genius...?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes...
It looks like flowers to me, but...
{CharName_1} says it's ♪Daddy.♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But you know, depending on how you think
about it, {CharName_1} might be have
great artistic talent.{NextPage_49}
Adults probably can't appreciate it...
{50_4_0_3}...Maybe our child's a genius...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}What're you doing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}Wow, you're working hard there!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
Don't you think that {CharName_1} is
quite a little athlete?
{41_2_0}I don't know...
Of course.
----------x----------
I'm sure of it.
{CharName_1} loves jumping around.
...Why, our child's a future sports star!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yeah, that's right.
{50_4_0_3}We have to help bring out this talent!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
{CharName_1} loves books.{NextPage_49}
Our child's so serious about reading.
In fact, just the other day...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}{CharName_1},
are you reading a book?{NextPage_49}
...What kind of book is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Hello? {CharName_1}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}Well, I've gotta go make supper.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why {CharName_1}.
Reading again?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}That's my little scholar!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} loves to study, I can tell.
Maybe our child's going to be a scholar!
{41_2_0}I think so too.
You're the kid's mother...
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}Yep.
...A famous scholar...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}Well, maybe I am a bit biased...
But we have to encourage {CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, there's something I
want to ask you. I don't mean to stick my
nose in your business, but...{NextPage_49}
Have things been going well on the farm?
{CharName_7} is worried because
you haven't been shipping much.
{41_2_0}I'm sorry. I'll try harder.
Who cares about this dumb old farm!
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}Do you really mean that?
{41_2_0}No, I'll try harder.
Sure I do!
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}You're joking, right?
{41_2_0}I'm joking.
I'm serious!
----------x----------
{50_4_0_4}I see...
Don't you care what happens to the farm?
{41_2_0}Of course. I'll try harder.
Not really...
----------x----------
{50_4_0_1}Oh, that's good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}...You scared me there.
{50_4_0_1}But, good. Try harder.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I guess it's up to you,
{2d}.{NextPage_49}
But I don't like making {CharName_7} worry...
Maybe you could try a little harder?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_30}........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_30}...............{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_30}..........................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_7}...I see.
Well, do what you want.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard a pretty singing voice just now...
Was that {CharName_20}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Could it have been {CharName_1}?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...{NextPage_49}
I wonder if {CharName_1} could have a
talent for music...
{CharName_20} said so.{NextPage_49}
I think our child really likes music, too.
What do you think, {2d}?
{41_2_0}I think so too.
I don't think so.
----------x----------
I thought you'd say that.
I hope {CharName_1}'s dreams come
true...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sure our child has the makings
of a great musician...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really...?
...Maybe I'm just being biased.{NextPage_49}
But our child does have a great singing
voice. I think we have to be
supportive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} may be a great musician!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...I wonder if {CharName_1}
has any artistic sense...
Could our child be an artist?{NextPage_49}
What do you think, {2d}?
{41_2_0}Sure.
It's too early to tell.
----------x----------
If {CharName_21} said so, it
has to be true!{NextPage_49}
I wonder what kind of artist....
Maybe a metal sculptor like Cody...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, that's true. It's too early to say.{NextPage_49}
But if our child has an artistic sense
like {CharName_21} said, then I think
we have to be supportive..{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you scared me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well of course you can't beat {CharName_13},
he's much older than you...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} is quite a fast runner.{NextPage_49}
{CharName_11} said so.
Could our child be an athlete?
{41_2_0}Maybe so.
Don't be silly.
----------x----------
{CharName_1} seems to like sports...
...Maybe a pro athlete....
{CharName_13}'d make a good pratice partner...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Maybe. But {CharName_1} did seem to
run pretty fast.{NextPage_49}
That child seems to like sports. Maybe we
have a future athlete in the family.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That professor said he wants
{CharName_1} to be his
assistant...{NextPage_49}
I knew that kid was smart!
{CharName_1}'s an academic, I know it!
What do you think, {2d}?
{41_2_0}I agree.
The kid's just curious.
----------x----------
I knew you'd think so!
A scholar!{NextPage_49}
We have to do everything we can
to help out!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess so. {CharName_1}'s still a kid.{NextPage_49}
But if {CharName_1}'s interested in
something, I think it's our duty as
parents to be supportive.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, I'm a little worried.{32_5_220}
...Is the everything going all right
with the farm?{NextPage_49}
I don't want to tell you your business,
but...
How are things going, really?
{41_2_0}I'm sorry. I'll try harder.
I don't want to do farm work.
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}...You mean that?
{41_2_0}Of course not. I'll try harder.
I'm serious!
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}You really mean that?
{41_2_0}No. I'll try harder.
Of course I do!
----------x----------
{50_4_0_4}I see...
You don't care what happens to the farm?
{41_2_0}I'm sorry. I'll try harder.
No, not really...
----------x----------
Oh, good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}...You scared me for a second.
{50_4_0_1}But, good. Try harder.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I guess it's up to you,
{2d}.{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_3}But {CharName_1}'s getting bigger
and I'd like to add on to the house...
We're going to be OK, right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_30}........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_30}...............{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_30}..........................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}...I see.
Well, do what you want.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, that's up to you...{32_3_232}
----------x----------
But I have things I want to say, too.{32_3_232}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_7}Sigh...{32_3_232}{50_4_0_0}....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...What kind of book is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Would you like a snack?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Why're you so serious all of a sudden?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Then why don't you just ask
your father?
I'm sure he'd be happy to teach you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Yes, I see... Wait! I can ask him for you!
Then you can ask him yourself when you
get the chance, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
It's about {CharName_1}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1} seems very interested in
your work.{NextPage_49}
So if {CharName_1} comes and asks you, I
want you to take some time for your child.
{41_2_0}Of course.
I'm too busy.
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}OK. Good.{NextPage_49}
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...I don't know the details, but it's
clear that {CharName_1} could
use some help from you, {2d}.{NextPage_1}Don't you think?{NextPage_49}
...Well, I guess {CharName_1}'ll
just have to learn by watching.{52_0_0_0}
{39_1}Right?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
It's about {CharName_1}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think {CharName_1} isn't very
interested in farm work. What about you?
{41_2_0}Maybe not.
Of course my child's interested!
----------x----------
...You think so too, {2d}?{NextPage_49}
But if there's something else
{CharName_1} likes, that's fine too.
It's {CharName_1}'s life, after all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You think so...?
If you say so, I guess maybe
it's true, but...{NextPage_49}
But if there's something else
{CharName_1} likes, that's fine too.
It's {CharName_1}'s life, after all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
....How have things been going recently?
The farm, I mean.
{41_2_0}It's going well.
Not great...
----------x----------
Really?{50_4_0_35}
Well, that's good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm... I see.{32_7_208}
{50_4_0_9}But our child's getting bigger,
so you really should work a little harder.{NextPage_49}
But if you don't feel like it,
I guess there's nothing I can do about it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Music is nice, but you should help your
father out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Art is nice, but you should help your
father out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sports are nice, but you should help your
father out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Studying is nice, but you should help your
father out sometimes, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I know you like the farm, but you're
still young. You have to try doing lots
of things while you still can.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh {2d}...{50_4_0_9}
{CharName_1} still hasn't come home.{NextPage_49}
And it's getting so late...
Where could that child be?
{41_2_0}I'll go looking.
{CharName_1} is an adult now.
----------x----------
Well, that's true.
But it's so late.
Couldn't you go out and have a look?
{41_2_0}Sure I'll go.
{CharName_1}'ll be back soon.
----------x----------
Yes, please do...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm. Listening to {CharName_27}'s guitar?
There's nothing wrong with music, but a
mother worries if her child's out so late.{NextPage_49}
That child certainly does like music.
Do we have a future musician on our hands?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I suppose so, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_1}'s back.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where have you been?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm. Listening to {CharName_27}'s guitar?
There's nothing wrong with music, but a
mother worries if her child's out so late.{NextPage_49}
That child certainly does like music.
Do we have a future musician on our hands?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Can I ask you something strange?
{41_2_0}No.
Sure.
----------x----------
Oh come on...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well...
Do round things ever look square?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}???
Of course not.
----------x----------
You don't understand that either, do you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You don't understand it either, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The truth is, {CharName_1}
asked me that out of the blue...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Hmm? What was that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
....What are you talking about?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, that's kind of difficult...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...So that's what happened.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder if our child might want to be an
artist... I think {CharName_1} is
pretty talented...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...What is it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No problem...
What should I do?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Got it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
OK, you ready?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ready.... Set... Go!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Go {CharName_1}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Finished!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_13}'s pretty fast, isn't he?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}...
{50_4_0_9}{CharName_1} still isn't home.{NextPage_49}
It's so late. Where
could that child be!
{41_2_0}I'll go look.
{CharName_1} is an adult now.
----------x----------
Well, that's true.
But I'm still worried.
I'm going to go look.
{41_2_0}No, I'll go.
{CharName_1}'ll be back soon.
----------x----------
Please do...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_19} seems to like {CharName_1}...{NextPage_49}
Being interested in {CharName_19}'s research
is fine, but staying out at all hours...{NextPage_49}
...I wonder if our child is thinking
of becoming a scholar...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, {CharName_1}'s back.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Where have you been?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_19} seems to like {CharName_1}...{NextPage_49}
Being interested in {CharName_19}'s research
is fine, but staying out at all hours...{NextPage_49}
...I wonder if our child is thinking
of becoming a scholar...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...What're you up to?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why...?{NextPage_49}
I don't know the details, but it was
before you were born...{NextPage_49}
I believe it was in the spring.
{CharName_7} and your father came
here.{NextPage_49}
{CharName_7} had been here before,
I heard...
With another man...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I only asked {CharName_7}
about it once.{NextPage_49}
But I guess that man was your father's
father. That makes him your grandfather.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't really know.
{CharName_7} won't tell me
me any more...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
....He doesn't seem to want to talk about
it. He just says he's working on the farm
in honor of your grandfather's memory.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Really?
...I'm sure your father'd like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
........I guess I've ended up causing
you a lot of unnecessary worry,
{CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
..................Well, bye.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}, what are you
doing here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm so hungry!
{CharName_25}, what's for dinner?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, what's with you guys?
Staring like that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you think, {CharName_1}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you don't think positively,
it'll never work out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, sometimes you just have to let
things work out. But do your best.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well... {32_1_244}Good luck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What're you looking at, {2d}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thinking about something...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...It's been a long time, hasn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}'s all grown up,{32_4_176}
and we've both gotten older...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why, your hair's turned all white
and you're all wrinkly!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...What?
{41_2_0}You're wrinkly too.
You're as beautiful as ever.
----------x----------
{50_4_0_4}Why you...{32_11_184}
{50_4_0_3}I guess neither of us is young anymore...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_13}...Come on, you don't really think that.
{50_4_0_26}But... It's nice of you to say.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But we've still got work to do.
{CharName_7} still works so hard every day.
----------x----------
{2d}...
{2d}, what's wrong?......!?{NextPage_49}
..................!?
{2d}! .....{2d}!!{NextPage_49}
{CharName_1}! Call
{CharName_31} here right away!!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{2d}, hang in there!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...So?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Our time together was so short...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_27}...
Could you play something special...
...For {CharName_0}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I'll just take a little look...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So what are you selling?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, are you listening to me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}{34_1_123}Hahaha.
You don't have anything to sell, bud.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}{34_1_123}What's the point? Hahaha.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Tell me when you actually have something.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll pay well for interesting stuff.
Good luck.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Anything good here...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I'll do a little shopping...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I'll give up for today.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How much is the {29_0}?
{41_3_2}For you, {2a_1_5}G.
It's {2a_2_5}G.
I can't sell that.
----------x----------
Hmm...
{50_4_0_9}Why are you giving me a discount?
{50_4_0_0}...Well, OK. I'll take it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmm....
........No, I guess not.
See you.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a little expensive... But OK.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That just makes me want it more...
Oh well...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't want it anymore.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}...............{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}......Maybe it's something I ate...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_26}What? Are you a dog or something?
Following me like that...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}.................{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}...........Sigh.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_4}Stop smiling like a moron.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_125}...Let me guess. You're a morning person?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm not in a great mood in the
morning, so beware.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
♪Hello there!♪
No, that's just not me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello....
I like this time of day best.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_125}I guess even people like you
sometimes stay out at this hour, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you normally visit people at this hour?
It's a little late, isn't it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This is where I'm staying.
Why are you here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_125}You come here often?
Hmm... I see...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_125}What a coincidence.
..........I guess I should be going.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that?
Huh. Really...
{41_2_0}Try it.
Looks good, huh?
----------x----------
...........{50_4_0_10}I'll give it a try.
{34_1_123}You're kind of strange, aren't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It doesn't really matter what I think,
does it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
................
I'll have {CharName_25} make something for me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, that looks great.
{41_2_0}Do you want it?
You can't have it.
----------x----------
I don't know if I'd go that far, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't particularly want it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now that I look at it, it's not so great.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ugh...
That doesn't look appetizing at all.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't even consider that food...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You like that kind of stuff?
What a weirdo.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Uh, thanks, but you can just keep
that for yourself, OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Oh, a baby.
...I guess the word ♪baby♪ is a
little insulting at this age.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow.
To have something like that come out of
your body. That's wild.{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_26}Hey... Don't get any ideas, bub.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Heehee. {50_4_0_10}Look at those chubby cheeks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess your kid's gonna like vegetables.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cute smile...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What tiny little hands and feet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Looking forward to them growing up?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Personally, I hope they take after
{CharName_3}...
That'd be more interesting...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Heehee. {50_4_0_10}Look at those chubby cheeks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Look at that smile!{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That kid's really friendly for being
so young. Just like you and Muffy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What tiny little hands and feet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How cute...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What tiny little hands and feet.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a sheepdog?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No, I guess not.
It looks like a pet...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}Oh, a cat!
{34_1_123}How cute!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that some cats live in two
houses at once, just taking advantage of
their owners. Can you believe that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, a chicken!
Is it from your farm? Huh...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Its little red crest is so cute.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Aww! How cute!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Baby chicks are so soft and cuddly.
You just want to pet them.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Wow.
A duck. Cool!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hi.
Is that a duck?
Wow, it's pretty small.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Aren't ducks usually wild animals?
But you have one for a pet...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Geese look kind of like ducks, but they
have little knobs on their bills.
No geese in {Location_43_30_23}, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What kind of seed is that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope it grows into a big tree.
Or maybe it's not that kind of seed?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow.
Did you grow that on your farm?
Cool.
{41_2_0}You can have it.
They're for sale.
----------x----------
Well, that's nice of you.
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Haha.
What, are you advertising or something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If it's a crop I've never had before,
I might be interested in buying it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Milk, huh?
I milked a cow once, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I milked that cow, the
milk came out in a stream
as big around as your little finger.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Ooh, cheese.
{50_4_0_2}Sniff sniff....
{50_4_0_10}{34_1_123}Not bad!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can make lots of kinds of
cheese depending on the kind of
milk, right? That's neat!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Butter, huh?
You can make that just using milk?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess it's the milk that decides how
butter tastes, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The harder the shell, the better the
egg. It means that the chicken's
well fed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Be care that they don't get stressed
out. I know I hate being stressed out.
I'm usually pretty laid back, though.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Wow, cool!!
Been fishing, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like fishing. I like to roast and eat
the fish right there on the riverbank.
Fish have to be fresh, you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A wild plant, huh?
I guess those can be good in some dishes.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are some pretty strange plants in
{Location_43_30_23}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?
Oh, did you make that?
Wow.
{41_2_0}You can have it.
It turned out well.
----------x----------
{34_1_124}For me......?
Uh, OK.
{50_4_0_10}Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's nice.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why don't you eat it at home?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that a hoe?
Kind of an unusual shape, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How is that different from a normal hoe?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_9}Woah, what is that thing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You like carrying things like that around?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_3}{34_1_123}Wow, you must be really happy about
getting a new tool if you carry it around.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well don't just go around showing it to
people. Use it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, you're working pretty hard.
I can tell by looking at your hoe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you going to go digging? If you
dig up anything interesting, show me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Now that's an old hoe.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
As long as it works, I guess it doesn't
matter how it looks, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A sickle?
That's pretty weird.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a sickle?
{34_1_123}It's kind of funny looking.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that a new sickle?
You really like farming, don't you?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Why are you walking around with that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you been using that all this time?
It's practically an antique!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't point that thing at me.
OK?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_124}What?
You plan to water me?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
No thanks.
If I want some water, I'll just go to
the {Location_43_33_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you use that thing to milk your cows?
{34_1_123}Neat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet you can get a lot of milk with that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow, you use those to cut
your sheep's wool?
That looks difficult.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I bet it takes a long time using those.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, clippers.
Going to shear your sheep?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know, those clippers look kind
like they're for humans...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've got a nice tool there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, good luck with that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you find that in {Location_43_30_23}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When I find things like that, I feel
like I'm a little girl again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You found something impressive there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe it's really a valuable artifact...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You really like living off the land, huh?
Just a reminder: you can't eat flowers.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know about the taste, but I wonder
if it's good for your body to eat those.
Anyway, I'm not interested.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}Ooh, a record!
Can you play it at your house?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Cool, a record.
I wish they'd get a player at the
{Location_43_35_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did {CharName_25} give you some of her
spice? She's quite a cook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_25} mixes her own
spices, you know.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}{50_4_0_10}Hey, that's nice...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_0_218}{32_5_220}I think I'll just listen to it for a bit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Isn't that a little bling bling for you?
...Oh, you got it from {CharName_11}?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll just never understand some people.
Why would someone give their medal away?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that necklace from the {Location_43_41_23}?
{34_1_123}Neat. Maybe it's cursed...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You'd better take good care of it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Music, huh?
You play an instrument?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've sure got a lot of different things.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}{34_1_123}Hahahaha!
Somebody gave you a firecracker?!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}You'd have be crazy to take
something like that!
{50_4_0_3}.............But it's real nice...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can never tell what you have in
your rucksack. It seems to smell
like lots of different things...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Show me the inside of your bag sometime.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A lot of people ask me why I'm traveling.
I don't really have a reason, so I
never know how to answer.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I never forget the people who were kind to
me. Take you for example.......{NextPage_49}
What was your name again?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes I just get the urge to
start traveling.
I'm just following my instincts.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I can't imagine owning my own land
like you do...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You know, I once met someone named
Aja on my travels. I wonder what they're
doing now...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I tried the {29_0} that you
gave me.
It was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, that {29_0}?
I gave it to {CharName_25}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I tried the {29_0} that you
gave me.
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
About that {29_0} you gave me...
I asked {CharName_25} to make something
with it.{NextPage_49}
{50_4_0_10}Everyone said it was good.
{34_1_123}You're not bad, you know that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_10}The {29_0} you gave me was
{34_1_123}really good.
That's one of my favorites.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That millk you gave me sure
tasted nutritious.
You know what I mean?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Kind of sweet... It was good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I tried the {29_0}.
Actually, that's one of my favorites.
{50_4_0_10}I didn't know you were such a good cook.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I tried the {29_0} you gave me.
I wouldn't mind some more.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I gave that {29_0} you gave me
to {CharName_26}.{NextPage_49}
He just wouldn't take his eyes off of it.
Maybe he likes that kind of thing?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're looking good.
Like the leader of animals or something.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Growing delicious vegetables is a kind
of magic, isn't it?{NextPage_49}
After all, they have the power to make
the people who eat them happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The food you cook is really
good.
Maybe you should change careers.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Most people do pretty much the same things
at the same time every day.
That's true of the people here, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Human beings find comfort by doing the
same things over and over. But you
can overdo it, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like the people who come to the
{Location_43_33_23}. They've very straighforward.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think it's important for there to be
places where kids can't go.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't have anything do to?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Not that there's anything wrong with that.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ruby and Tim sure get along well.
I wonder if marriage is really like that?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I find that I can relax here.
There's nobody watching me...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The people here are so peaceful.
I'll never be like that, but I can't help
wishing I could be...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Time seems to flow differently in {Location_128_15_128}{32_128_53}get-{17}
{Location_128_48_128}{_28}-not{17}. Maybe that's why I can't leave.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Even if you don't do anything, time
keeps passing...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sometimes I wonder what I really
want to do with my life...
Oh, never mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Ruby's a good person, isn't she?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
They say kids grow up like their parents,
but I don't think that's true.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Farming looks pretty difficult.
I don't think I'm cut out for it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Working men's hands are nice and rough.
...Like yours.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The people here are always so happy
when Spring rolls around.
I wonder what's so great about it...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Don't you think that smiles wouldn't
be nearly as attractive if we didn't have
frowns too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The people here are all pretty warm
and friendly, but I bet they all have
problems of their own...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh man...
I never meant to stay so long here in
{Location_128_15_128}{32_128_53}get-me-not Valley{17}...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
But I guess Spring is the
most cheerful of the four
seasons, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Meetings and farewells are two sides of
the same coin. Don't you think?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}Whew..............!
It's h-hot!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}What? I'm hot and in
a bad mood, so stay away from me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}It's so hot!
I feel like I'm gonna melt!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}I bet you can't work in this kind of heat.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}Ugh......
I'm melting! I'm melting!{32_1_244}
Maybe I should go play in the river...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish it would hurry up and get cooler.
I don't feel like doing anything...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
To us, the falling leaves may seem sad
and lonely. But to the trees, it's just
another part of their lives.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_35}Leaves...fire...baked yams...
{50_4_0_3}...Baked yams are pretty good, you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you ever make baked yams?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The leaves are so pretty...
I love this time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I always end up eating too much
in the Fall.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Everything's so tasty this time of year.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wonder what it'd be like to hibernate...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's cold, huh?
But I kind of like it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you take a deep breath, doesn't it feel
like the cold air cleans your whole body?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish the snow would build up a bit...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have you seen a white furry creature
in the Forest?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Another year passed already...
Over before you know it...
I guess life is kind of like that, too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you know what's on the other side of
the ocean? It's better if you don't know.
That way you can use your imagination.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Listen to the sound of the waves...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I wish this place was even further
away from the rest of the world...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
....I love it here.........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.....Sigh...............{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}I don't like being spoken to here.
...But since it's you, I'll allow it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I was listening to the forest sounds.
It was just getting interesting, but...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
If you listen really hard, I bet you can
hear some interesting things too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_24}...I can hear the leaves
whispering to each other.......{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Could you be quiet?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you need something?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_2}I asked you what you wanted!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like it here. It's fun.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It looks like there are a lot of
instruments here, I guess....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe I'll ask Gustafa to teach me
what he knows about them...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I don't know much about instruments,
but I know what kind of music I like.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It must be nice to be able to play an
instrument. Gustafa looks so happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Come to think of it, I think I took
some kind of lessons when I was a kid...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It can be nice to get away... To someplace
where everybody knows your name...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Stone Oil, huh?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey, {50_4_0_10}drink up.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
....Whee!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm feeling pretty good right now.
{50_4_0_10}Heehee...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Uh...
You have business with Cody too?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It seems kind of like outer space here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Cody and I seem to have some
things in common.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...................
{41_2_0}Do you like the ocean?
...................
----------x----------
..............I guess.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...................
..........What? You're weird........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...You really have to pay attention to
be able to smell the plants and the soil.
But they smell good, you know?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...They say you shouldn't get too close
to trees when there's a lightning
storm...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess I should be going...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Are you still worried about that?
Well I'm not.
Tomorrow will take care of itself!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hey there.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
....If we talk to each other here it'll
look like we're making out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So you and I are gonna be family, huh?
There's something strange about that!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_123}If I'm just dreaming, I wouldn't
mind waking up now.{NextPage_49}
After all, I had a lot of fun.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...You know, I was thinking. I've been
a lot of places, but maybe this one
wouldn't be a bad place to settle down.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{34_1_123}You really saved my life.
{50_4_0_10}I'm glad you were here in {Location_43_30_23}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Are you good at cooking?
Cook me lots of good food when
we start to live together.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry, I'm a little busy right now.
Could you make it later?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Sorry, but thanks!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's chilly today.
Why does it have to rain...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've noticed that the people here
don't seem to pay much attention
to the rain.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess they're at one with nature...
Or do they just not notice the rain?{32_1_244}
{50_4_0_10}No, that can't be...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When the weather is like this I tend to
remember bad experiences from my past.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Aren't your clothes wet? You're pretty
energetic for a day like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You'd think the clouds would be empty
pretty soon, with it raining like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard there's a farmer in Mineral Town
who's won a dog frisby catching
contest ten times...{NextPage_49}
Well, I think it was his dog that won...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard there's a farmer in Mineral Town
who's won a horse race many times.
Did you know that?{NextPage_49}
Maybe he's better at that than farming.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard the farmer in Mineral Town
is a chicken master who can make them
bow to his every whim.{NextPage_49}
He's unstoppable at the chicken festival.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard there's a farmer in Mineral Town
who's won the cow festival many times.
Did you know that?{NextPage_49}
I'd like to eat a cow like that...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard there's a farmer in Mineral Town
who's won the sheep festival many times.
Did you know that?{NextPage_49}
I wonder if those sheep'd be very tasty...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm going to go to bed soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...I'm going to bed so could you leave?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's my bedtime. Night...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I have to be going out soon...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Um, I'm going out now, so...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm leaving.
Come on. You too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_1}, isn't it nice to
be with your Daddy?{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're all clean now! Isn't that nice?{u_805a}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't cry, {CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
........{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's nothing...
If you want something, go ahead and talk.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...I guess it's not bad...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You're pretty pushy, you know?
Don't worry about me.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...I'm going home now. {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_0}Gustafa's music makes me feel
so good.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_0}...Maybe it's because
he's the one playing it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{50_4_0_26}Yeah, I think that's it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm all wet... {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well it makes me depressed, so I hate it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Blessing? {NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe you're right.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You think too much, Cody.{NextPage_1}You take too long to make your artwork.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to see you working on one
of your pieces.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's all I wanted to say.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
When you work on your artwork, you're...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...interesting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Do you have a minute?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to do something...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How should I put it...?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'd like to do something for you and Tim.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've helped me so much...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, never mind...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll think of something...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
A wedding.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I heard that you and Tim never had
a wedding ceremony.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
So...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We're going to...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Have one now.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Thanks for cooking for me all those times.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You two are getting married...?{32_5_220}
Congrats!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
What are you mad about?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Just do what you like, {CharName_1}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Oh, there you are.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What's wrong with {CharName_1} recently?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hm?
A rebellious phase?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I forgot about that kind of thing.
Yeah, that might be it.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
..................
Have you been eating too many oily foods?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is it your heart?
Have Dr. Hardy take a look.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It me....
Do you have a minute?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm sorry to come so suddenly like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's been a year since you came here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I've finally made up my mind.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You wanna get married?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Sure.
I'm sorry.
----------x----------
Thanks.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Well, I hope it works out.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
....{32_1_244}I understand...
{32_15_160}Well, bye...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess it just wasn't meant to be...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
I'm sorry to come so suddenly like this.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you realize that it's been a year
since you came here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I like you quite a bit.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Maybe we should get hitched...?{NextPage_1}{41_2_0}Sure.
...I'm sorry.
----------x----------
All right.
Cool.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
This should be interesting.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I understand.
Oh well.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Bye...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
