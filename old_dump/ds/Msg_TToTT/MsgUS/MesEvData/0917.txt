\u1f41\u1fab\u1f49\u2136What a pretty song!\u2328This melody is\u2328so relaxing...\u232b\u1f40\u1fb5\u1f49\u2135It's woooonderful!\u2328This is a great song. I'd\u2328love to play it in the caf.\u232b\u1f41\u1fa8\u1f49\u2136If I close my eyes, I can\u2328see flowers in fall.\u2328What an amazing song.
\u1f40\u1fb3\u1f49\u2135I like this song! It makes\u2328me feel like I'm outside on\u2328a sunny day. Right, Ash?\u232b\u1f41\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136It does.\u2328It makes me want to go on a\u2328picnic with my animals.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb1\u1f49\u2135Those two are so close.\u2328A picnic sounds like a good\u2328idea, though...
\u1f40\u1fb0\u1f49\u2135What a nice song.\u2328It's perfect for doing\u2328something sophisticated.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb6\u1f49\u2136I agree.\u2328I bet a glass of wine would\u2328taste nice with this song.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb5\u1f49\u2135Or a fine glass of tea!\u2328

\u1f41\u1fac\u1f49\u2136That looks like so much fun.\u2328I wish I could play an\u2328instrument like that!\u232b\u1f40\u1fab\u1f49\u2135Me too.\u2328Maybe we should start\u2328practicing for next year.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb3\u1f49\u2136I wanna do it too!\u2328Then I can play songs for\u2328my family.
\u1f40\u1fa8\u1f49\u2135Music is so nice.\u2328My heart feels so full...\u232b\u1f41\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136I know what you mean.\u232bI always look forward to the\u2328Music Festival because I\u2328feel so refreshed after it.\u232b\u1f40\u1fb1\u1f49\u2135Hee hee! Well then, we'll \u2328have to ask Mikhail to play\u2328for us again next year.

\u1f41\u1fa6\u1f49\u2136The music festival is so\u2328much fun. I'd love to play\u2328this music for my animals.\u232b\u1f40\u1fab\u1f49\u2135Maybe you and Cheryl could\u2328play music together for\u2328your animals...\u232b\u1f40\u1fb3\u1f49\u2135I'll practice a lot!\u2328Ash, will you practice\u2328with me?
