Oh{u_0086}{2d} hello there.{NextPage_49}
My name's Lumina. I came
from a place called Forget-
Me-Not Valley.{NextPage_49}
Nice to meet you{u_0086}{2d}
{_2e}.{NextPage_0}

There are fish in Forget-Me-Not
Valley{u_0086}{2d} too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The owner of the farm there
seems to be good at fishing.{NextPage_49}
I wonder what the fish are like
here?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{_2e}{u_0086}{2d} is fishing fun?{NextPage_49}
I like playing the piano and
drawing pictures.{NextPage_49}
But the piano isn't going
very well for me recently...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The people around here are
so relaxed.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
One of the fishermen here gave 
me a fish once...{NextPage_49}
But my butler 
Sebastian cooked it{u_0086}{2d} so....{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The summers in Forget-Me-Not
Valley are pretty nice too.{NextPage_49}
You should come and visit!{NextPage_0}

You're working hard on your
fishing{u_0086}{2d} right{u_0086}{2d} {_2e}?{NextPage_49}
