\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136Tap \u206dRequests\u206c on the bottom\u2328screen if you want to check\u2328what requests you've taken.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136Now, why don't you try\u2328taking on a request?\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136First, check the message\u2328board. You'll see requests\u2328on the bottom screen.\u232bUse the \u206d+Control Pad\u206c to\u2328select a request, then push\u2328the \u206dA Button\u206c to view it.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136I put up a starter request,\u2328so try picking that one!
\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136OK. I'll explain it again,\u2328then.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136This is the \u206dmessage board\u206c.\u232bVillagers who need something\u2328done will post their\u2328\u206drequests\u206c here.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136To read the requests, just\u2328stand in front of the board\u2328and press the \u206dA Button\u206c.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136I hope you'll take on some\u2328requests when you have the\u2328opportunity.
\u2332 Yes, please.\u2328 No thanks, I got it.
\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136\u2136That's the way! That's how\u2328you accept a request!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136For the request you just\u2328accepted, the \u206drequester\u206c is\u2328\u206dRutger\u206c... Me, of course!\u232bAnd just like it's written\u2328on the request, I want to\u2328explain something to you.\u232bSo, let's go back to\u2328your farm now.
\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136The second thing to remember\u2328is how to deliver the item\u2328to the requester.\u232bFirst, after taking on the\u2328request, get the item and\u2328put it in your bag.\u232bNext, talk to the requester,\u2328and they'll ask if you want\u2328to talk about the request.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136After that, a screen will\u2328appear where you can give\u2328the requester their item.
\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136After you've delivered the\u2328items requested, you'll\u2328receive a \u206dreward\u206c.\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f4a\u2136This is the final thing\u2328to remember, and it's\u2328important!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f48\u2136If your bag is full...\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f4a\u2136...You'll be forced to \u206dthrow\u2328away one of your items\u206c, or\u2328\u206dlose your reward\u206c!\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f4b\u2136You wouldn't want to lose\u2328the reward you worked so\u2328hard for, would you?\u232b\u1f41\u1fb0\u1f49\u2136So make sure you have room\u2328for your reward when you go\u2328to fulfill a request!
