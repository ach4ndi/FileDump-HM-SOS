{CharName_0}...{32_3_232}{NextPage_1}Do you have a minute?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The {Location_43_38_23} is still sleeping.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
There are many conditions that
have to be fulfilled for
the goddess to come.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's why we have to collect a
lot of {u_0086}{_2e}nices.{u_0086}{_2e} We're preparing
for the goddess.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All right!
Let's go and find ourselves some
{u_0086}{_2e}nices{u_0086}{_2e}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
None here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We're looking for {u_0086}{_2e}nices.{u_0086}{_2e}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nope.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's try somewhere else!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nope. None here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought for sure there would be some
around here...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I guess not...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's look somewhere else!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Nope. None here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought for sure there would be some
around here...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
・・・ő{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Let's look somewhere else!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
None here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I thought for sure there would be some
around here...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
....Hmmm.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's it!
That singing voice is nice!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Way to go guys! Let's keep it up
and go looking other places!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...Not yet{u_0086}{2d} I guess.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hello{u_0086}{2d} {CharName_0}.{NextPage_49}
Today we have a test to see
whether the goddess will come to
the {Location_43_38_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
...I guess not...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We've got to go out and collect
even more {u_0086}{_2e}nices{u_0086}{_2e}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All right! Let's keep up the
good work!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}But who could it be?{35_0}{NextPage_49}
{35_2}We're the only sprites in this
town.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}{CharName_0}?{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{35_2}I'm Nak.
Nice to meet you.{35_0}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
For one thing{u_0086}{2d} the {Location_43_38_23} must be clean.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Your calf has grown big enough not
to need the calf hutch.{NextPage_49}
So we'll put the hutch
in the {Location_43_23_23} and put the calf
in its new home!{32_3_232}{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We put the calf in the calf hutch
into its home. So you won't need
the calf hutch anymore.{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
We'll put it in the {Location_43_23_23}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}...{32_3_232}{NextPage_49}
Bring that one to its home.{NextPage_49}
----------x----------
A little while before she is going
to give birth{u_0086}{2d} you need to
isolate her.{NextPage_49}
From now on{u_0086}{2d} you'll need to do
this by yourself{u_0086}{2d}{CharName_0}.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I hope the calf comes soon!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Something terrible's happened!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
.......................{NextPage_49}
The poor thing.{32_3_232}
You have to look after them
more carefully...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{CharName_0}!
We've got a new friend!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
What do you want to name it?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
{Input_128}?
That's a nice name!♪{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We'll put {Input_128}
in the calf hutch.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It's mine!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I found it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's because I didn't realize
it was a {13}Blue Feather{17}!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmph!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Hmph!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
How sad.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'll give it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm the one who gave it!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't go any further that way.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't go further than this.{32_1_244}
But if you want to know what's going on
over there{u_0086}{2d} you should link.{NextPage_49}
Would you like to link to the
Game Boy Advance game {u_0086}{_2e}Harvest Moon{u_0085}{2c_2_1}Friends of Mineral Town{u_0086}{_2e}?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
First{u_0086}{2d} turn off the Game Boy Advance and
insert the {u_0086}{_2e}Harvest Moon{u_0085}{2c_2_128}{10}riends of
Mineral Town{u_0086}{_2e} Game Pak.. After connecting{NextPage_1}it to the Nintendo GameCube{u_0086}{2d} turn on the
Game Boy Advance. This game can only{NextPage_49}
link to data from {u_0086}{_2e}Friends of
Mineral Town.{u_0086}{_2e}{NextPage_1}And only with data that hasn't already
connected with a different game.{32_1_244}
So{u_0086}{2d} do you want to link now?{40_0_0}
----------x----------
OK{u_0086}{2d} come back later when you want
to link.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
All right...{32_1_244} Come back later when
you want to link again.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
You should share happy things with others.
Then everyone will be happy.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We've been here since before there
were people living here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Don't take too much food away
from the forest. There won't be
any left for us!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
The people in {Location_43_30_23} are
funny. So we go to see them
all the time.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Wow{u_0086}{2d} that's amazing.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You can't use that here.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We don't need those.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We know about those{u_0086}{2d} too.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
We carry those to all places{u_81be}
to help flowers spread.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
That's a baby plant.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Is that your dinner?{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I'm hungry...{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
I think we'll eat soon.{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

at {24_2}Farm?
Good job!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
It must have taken a lot of work
to grow! I bet it's delicious!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Eat it while it's fresh and
tasty!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
Did you make that
at {24_2}Farm?
Amazing!!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------
You've taken good care of
your animals! I'm sure
it's delicious!{NextPage_0}
----------x----------

----------x----------
How do you eat that??{NextPage_0}
